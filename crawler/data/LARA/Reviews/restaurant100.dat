<Content> I am yet to meet somebody who doesn't LOVE Black Dog Smoke & Ale House. This little hole in the wall packs genuine barbeque cuisine unlike anywhere in the vicinity of C-U. Yes, you may have heard it's a small restaurant with a perpetually long wait, but it's worth walking around adorable downtown Urbana for awhile before you're seated. I've also done a carry-out with several other people which only took about 25 minutes to prepare.There's a variety of BBQ sauces from mild to hot listed and detailed on the menu. My personal favorite is the Texas Sauce; it has that smoky flavor I expect out of Midwestern Barbeque. Also, you haven't really lived until you've tried the brisket sandwich.As for side dishes, my friends and I swear by the Twice Baked Potato Casserole. The sweet potato fries are irresistibly sweet and caramelized. Overall, Black Dog provides a one of a kind cuisine. Also VEGETARIANS-- there are some delicious options for you, too.

<Content> Why I haven't reviewed this place sooner is a mystery to me. Downtown Urbana has become a much better place since the opening of Black Dog. BD has become one of my regular dinner spots, their meals hardly ever disappoint. The only drawback is the waiting, sometimes you stroll right in and get seated, other times, it's an hour wait. The wait staff is very hit or miss, I have a few favorite waiters (yup, guys) and one waitress that I think are helpful, attentive, and funny. What to eat: Appetizers: smoked chicken wings, smoked artichoke dip (AMAZING!) Meats: anything pork (seriously), smoked chicken (I MUST try their brisket)Sides: fries, beans, slaw, twice baked potato casserole (I must try their sweet potato fries)Meh: Cuban sandwich -- while it's the best one in town, I was a bit disappointed in its size and it's good, but not excellent. That said, I might give it a second try.Misses: Chicken salad (new) and their very popular corn bread (sorry, it's all of that meat in it, for some reason I just can't like it!)I was just there this past Tuesday and am already planning my return. 4/5 stars because of the long waiting, running out of food quickly (though who can blame the hoards of hungry customers?!), and the hit-or-miss wait staff-I HIGHLY recommend this place the food is excellent, the drinks are good, and the prices are very fair

<Content> Good BBQ, but it didn't really 'wow' me. Possibly it's because I didn't get the burnt ends, but they were out of that by the time I strolled in on a Saturday night. Wasn't too long of a wait for me, only about 2 couples ahead of me and the gf. Got seated at the bar and had an unfriendly waitress. She just seemed stressed and unhappy. Heard her say to another table that it was a long day, so tried not to bother her with anything. I waited until she left and asked another waitress for a different bbq sauce with my meal ha. Anyway, I ordered the rib tips since they guy next to me got it and it looked delicious. It was alright, nothing crazy. I got one of the vinegar bbq sauces first and didn't like it at all. That's when I got the Georgia one which was a lot better and thicker. The twice baked potato casserole, I think it was called, was delicious. The potato salad was meh, you could probably skip on that. The gf got the chicken salad which came with a bunch of crackers. It was a different style on chicken salad so not really sure what to compare it too. It was alright though. We also split some corn bread and that was meh too. I think it was over hyped in my mind from some of these other reviews. Over all it was alright, wasn't too expensive either and you get a pretty decent amount of food. Had to take some home since there was so much so that's always a positive. One day I'll try those burnt ends....one day....

<Content> I adore Black Dog. If not for the health concerns, I would have eaten here every week when I was on campus. I would definitely go for the burnt ends, but they sell like hot cakes, so make sure you get there early or order ahead of time.I was interviewing the owner and staff for an article, and everyone was beyond passionate about their food. As I was taken back to see the smoking rack, I was happy to see the staff joking and laughing with each other. They seemed so at ease and seemed to enjoy their work. From the bartenders to the wait staff to the chefs, everything is bar none here. It shows in the quality of the bbq and the excellent drink recommendations made.I've seen people get the whiskey fleet and be awed by the beautiful presentation. Plus, there's nothing better than a spot of whiskey, burnt ends, pulled pork, mashed potatoes and some sweet potato fries. Better hit the gym afterwards, but you know it'll be worth it.

<Content> If you're looking for good BBQ cuisine in the Champaign-Urbana area, look no further than Black Dog!!! It is UNBELIEVABLE!! Get there earlier in the day to make sure you get an order of burnt ends. They are so popular that supplies does not last very long. It is a small restaurant, so there is usually a bit of a wait. However, IT IS WELL WORTH THE WAIT! I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!!

<Content> This restaurant is a MUST if you are in the Champaign/Urbana area.The food, the drink, and the service are all WONDERFUL. I ordered the brisket and catfish as my proteins and beans and cornbread as my sides. The brisket and beans were my favorite food items: the brisket was smokey and moist and the beans were moderately spicy and were made with drippings from the brisket, YUM! The catfish was nothing to write home about but with the flight of sauces that I ordered I was able to pair it up with a sauce that made it more interesting (favorite sauces were the Georgia Peach, Texas BBQ, and Carolina vinegar). I also ordered the top-shelf bourbon flight which had the best bourbon I've ever tasted, 20 year Pappy Van Winkle! The pours were large which was a pleasant surprise for a top-shelf flight, much appreciated.As far as service goes, I have never had such a welcoming, fun-loving, and informed server as I did at Black Dog. Everyone at the place made our 8 top feel like they were happy we were there and wanted us to love everything we ate, and we most certainly did. I will definitely be back, again and again and again.

<Content> Mmmmmm soooo good. I went here for the first time last week. This place gets packed as the doors open. There isn't a lot of seating here. You might have to wait an hour for your food but it is worth the wait. If you like pulled pork or good food you should come here. The sweet potato fries are one of the best I have had, and the bbq sauces are good. I was not a fan of the beans, they had too much of a smokey flavor. The sweet tea was on point. The waitress was really friendly and interacted well with all the customers. For such a busy place they do a great job with customer service. Everyone in the area needs to experience this place at least once in their lifetime.

<Content> Black dog is seriously worth the wait. I came during lunch on a weekend and had a 30-40 minute wait, but the food came out quite quickly and the staff are so nice that it didn't matter.I ordered the brisket sandwich, slaw on the side with cornbread. I don't think I could've ordered anything better because I was in actual BBQ heaven. While I wanted to get the burnt ends I was unfortunately out of luck as they had already sold out - I have heard rave reviews from all my die-hard friends and one day I will get my hands on those meaty bits of goodness. For those that are looking to drink, they have a pretty diverse selection of beer to choose from, and it's constantly changing. I got the Green Flash double stout which I'd definitely recommend if it's still on the menu! A++ BD.

<Content> Came at 5:30pm the Friday of homecoming seeking and was sat by 6. Have a great seat by the window, a little breezy with the door, but get to look down the restaurant and outside. Fun watching people write their names on the sign in board. It was nice that we could have a drink while we waiting outside. We were also able to look at menus while we waited so we didn't lose time. We were able to order as soon as we were seated.First they have a great selection of hard ciders. So for the non-beer drinker I can say hurray! First round for appetizer we had the cornbread...oh yeah delicious. There were 3 of us doing the geometry to divide it up so we each got the same amount. If we didn't have a ton of other food coming we would have ordered another.I had the pulled pork with the special chipotle slaw, baked beans, twice baked casserole. OMG the chipotle slaw was so good on the pork that I ordered another side so I could finish my pork with it. The smoke in the beans is no joke. I mean they need to bottle and sell this. I could eat it all the time. So good I mixed it into the already amazing twice baked potato casserole. Heaven! Mom had the beef brisket with chipotle slaw with twice bake casserole. Needless to say, it was eaten with enjoyment.! The brisket just melted in the mouth. And she was so happy when I ordered more of the chipotle slaw, it also complemented the brisket quite nicely.Dad had ribs, brisket, and polish sausage with the special side of green beans and smoked sweet potato. As with the rest of the meal yum! The ribs fell of the bone. And the pairing of the sausage and the Texas sauce was perfect.I just never had a bad bite. In fact we enjoyed our meal so much that my mom is even considering we come back tomorrow night in our way back out of town.If you are in Urbana you MUST eat here!

<Content> Winner, winner, BBQ dinner!? Yes! TL;DR Quality BBQ here and easily one of the best places to eat in CU area.We signed in our group of 5 at 3:30 and were seated at 4 on a Saturday, get there early!My family are sort of BBQ fanatics, we had to try 3 different places in Memphis last time we were down, so seeing Black Dog rated highly on Yelp, we had to go when they came down to visit!Most of us had some variety of beef brisket while my grandmother also got ribs and my grandfather the chicken.We thought the brisket was tender and flavorful and not overly fatty. We tried some of the ribs too and really liked them! Very thick and meaty rather than fall-off-the bone style, which some people prefer. My grandfather said the chicken was good, but he did not like the side of cornbread that came with it. A traditional southerner, this cornbread was more muffin-style and too sweet for his preferences (I thought it was good). We also did like the twice baked casserole, French fries and sweet potato fries that were on the side, as well as the slaw that was on our sandwiches.Service was good but at the end a little slow to take our check due to a shift change, not a big deal!Now come my only 2 complaints. Complaint #1 would have to be that Black Dog is pretty stingy with their sauces. What came on the sandwiches was hardly anything, probably less than your average BBQ eater would like. We tried 3 different sauces I believe the hot peach, Texas and one other one, they all appeared to be good but I really cant provide an accurate taste test because we had so little of it! We also did not want to pay an extra $0.25 for extra, although my father did anyway because he's a sauce maniac! My other complaint is that the portion size was probably smaller than most BBQ places for the price. Our sandwiches were $9 and they came with one side which varied in size based on what we got. I had the casserole which was just a little cup, whereas my mom had a decent portion of sweet potato fries. I didn't leave hungry but I would probably get the combo or platter next time!Overall Black Dog has really great food for its location and I really like how I don't have to go to Memphis to get similar quality BBQ. It's nice to know that there is a local place that is very successful and also with great food and beer to go along with it.I'll definitely be back!

<Content> Amazing BBQ! Friends recommended we stop here on a road trip. They did not steer us wrong!I had no idea how good Illinois BBQ could be. The meats, especially the burnt ends, were succulent and smoky. You don't even need the sauce. We also got the mustard sauce and the Carolina red sauce. Both were mouthwateringly good. We were also pleased by how great the slaw and side salad were. The greens were organic, local and fresh, and the vinaigrette dressing was delicious. It's not every day you go to a BBQ place with great salad.Service was perfect. Such a nice waiter.

<Content> You've gotta come check out Black Dog! They're usually packed, so be sure to come in early! This is definitely one of the better BBQ I've had. The corn bread here is ridiculously good. Be sure to try some of that. Just be careful as it's addicting! I've always found myself buying extra so I can bring it home!Anyways, I always get a sampler of everything there. The brisket and ribs are definitely my favorites there. You can't go wrong with that.They also have some amazing service. From the moment I walked in, there was a guy (forgot his name) that was very inviting and with a great sense of humor. Wish I can go back, but I'm back in LA!

<Content> Wonderful meal! Came here with our toddler after seeing a game at UIUC at about 9:00. Wait staff is phenomenal. They were out of many things, but we were prepared for this thanks to other Yelpers. What we were able to get was PHENOMENAL. Had the flight of sauces and we were very impressed. We rarely go to a BBQ place and like all of their different sauces, but Black Dog has hit a home run with each and every one! Our favs were the mustard, Texas BBQ, Carolina red and Lexington dip. Brisket was awesome. The vinaigrette they make for the salads is super. And they had a great beer menu.We loved it and will definitely be making an excuse to do the 2.5 hour drive again!The only thing we wouldn't get again was the cornbread because it was very salty. But if you're a first-timer, you need to try it because it's so different!We loved it.

<Content> Superb BBQ! They have daily specials, but they also run out of certain items by lunchtime. Speaking of lunchtime, be ready for a ~15 minute wait, even for a party of 2-3. Once you're seated, the service is good, and the aforementioned BBQ makes it worth the wait. I spotted a solid selection of craft beer; I'll have to come back for dinner.

<Content> I hit Black Dog on the rave recommendations of several friends. They speak the truth. Black Dog is the bomb.*When you show up, you'll notice the place is packed. Walk up to the slab of paper, grab a sharpie and write your name down. You'll be called when there's room for you to begin your BBQuest.A sign near the entryway notified us they were out of burnt ends and mac 'n' cheese. We mourned this loss and regrouped in time to be seated.Let's start with the cornbread. You can order it as a side to your main dish or as an appetizer. The appetizer portion ($2.95) is solid enough for two people. The cornbread contains green chiles, pit beans, cheese and pulled pork. Boom. Regular bread is forever ruined.If you like sauces, Black Dog allows you to order a flight of all eight of theirs for just $2. Milo's Mustard and Carolina Red were my favorite.For my main dish, I went with a 3 meat combo. Ribs, chicken and brisket. Chicken was my favorite. Succulent, soft and juicy, it paired very nicely with any sauce, but it was a home run with the mustard.The ribs were appropriately soft and smoky. I really loved these with the Carolina Red sauce.The brisket was good, but not particularly outstanding.I live in Chicago, but Black Dog is good enough to merit a two and a half hour drive. If you're in the area, you have to check out this temple of meat!* Saying things are "the bomb" was a popular expression in the early 2000s. Despite its rapid decline in coolness, some people still use it earnestly. Others use it ironically. You are free to decide the context in this review.

<Content> When I travel, I like to find the small local places in the hopes of discovering a gem and I found one tonight. I had the smoked catfish because 4 other items (brisket, burnt ends, ribs, and something else) were sold out, but it was right up my alley. The corn bread was absolutely awesome. Get there early if you want to full menu but be prepared to wait. They also have a wonderful beer selection to go along with your meal. The bartender seemed a little grouchy when I first arrived, but heck, I am most of the time too, and I don't require much attention anyways. I will definitely be back and a BIG THANK YOU for a wonderful meal.

<Content> woww, this place is TOP NOTCH! I had to give it 5 stars. I went to the University of Illinois at UC and during my four years there, I never heard of this place. WHAT A SHAME! I have truly missed out. I went there this past weekend after much hype from previous colleagues. The setting is just as you expect it.. always a wait [20-30 mins], very... barbequ-ie. You know, metal trays, easily cleanable, amazing smell, tasty beers, etc.Anyway, I heard so much about the burnt ends I had to get them. They only serve them twice a day. At least, this is what I am told. They have them when they open and they have them in the afternoon/dinner time. But once they run out, you'll have to wait til next time. :-( saddd face. Luckily, They had the burnt ends. Naturally, i ordered them. They were sooooo tender. I can't recall any other meat I've had in my LIFE as tender as these. They literally would fall apart when you picked them up. // Burnt ends - DEFINITELY get these. enough said. // Cornbread appetizer - easily the tastiest cornbread I've ever had. I think they put bacon in it? or some sort of meat. So soft and savory. It was very unique and definitely should be on your check. // Sauce flight - $2 - this is very cool for your first time but I wouldn't get it again. I wanted to try all the sauces but my favorite was the milos mustard. Also the vinegar one is great too. I forgot the name. I would get it your first time to kind of try all the sauces. // Sides - all of our sides were veryyyyy good. the FRENCH FRIES were amazing. They must be friend in pork fat. seriously, I have only had fries like that at one other place and they were fried in pure fat [or so i speculated]. Didn't get to try to sweet potato fries. The mac and cheese was good, a bit on the smaller portion.The only thing i didnt like... was the ribs. They were just a little bit to tough and didn't fall off the bone like i expected. I would opted out of these. But honestly, the burnt ends were so good that it didn't even matter what else I had.If you are every traveling through the champaign-urbana area... STOP AT THIS PLACE. Happy eating!

<Content> Black Dog is a staple of Champaign-Urbana by now. Coming from Texas, I didn't expect to find great BBQ, especially in Urbana, but I'm so glad I was wrong. The food here is fantastic and I recommend waiting out the long line to eat. It's well worth it. I highly recommend the Texas caviar as an appetizer. If I didn't care about my waistline I would order it every time. The burnt ends are good - there's a reason they sell out like crazy - but I don't think they're the best value for your money. I usually get the hot polish and brisket with the twice baked potato casserole and baked beans. The fries are also great, but I LOVE the potato casserole. You're missing out if you don't get it. My boyfriend loves the rib tips. I think they're the best value for your money, but I get annoyed putting that much effort into eating ;-)The sweet tea isn't great. I wouldn't order it if you're looking for legit sweet tea. The Carolina red sauce is my favorite. Black Dog switched their default sauce from that to the Lexington something other. Not sure why because I think the new default sauce isn't great at all. The Georgia peach is also good, but of you don't like sweet sauce stick with the Carolina. I will definitely miss Black Dog after leaving Champaign.

<Content> The lines to get in are almost always long, which tells you something about the food. The burnt ends are out of this world, if you can get them. They make two batches a day. I think they are done at noon and 5 pm and they go pretty fast, for good reason.

<Content> Great bbq joint. You can't ask for better service. I can honestly say that if you ordered an appetizer, it may come after your meal. Or just force them to not give you your food right away. We ordered and in less than a minute our food was on the table. I compliment our waiter for messing up our order and bringing us the wrong side because he ended up bringing us the side that we actually ordered and let us keep the other. That was deserving of generous tip for the nice fellow. Great BBQ, Better Service.

<Content> Simply awesome. Incredible BBQ. Fantastic specials. Great drink selection. CANNOT GO WRONG. The biggest downside is the wait (often 30+ minutes). \When you get there you write your name down on butcher paper and it is your job to know where you are on the list. You can't call ahead to make a reservation and they won't seat your till everyone in your party is there. But if you can get a seat you will not be disappointed. DONT leave champaign/urbana without having tried Black Dog

<Content> This place is GOOD. As in, "I don't eat meat but I eat BBQ at Black Dog" good. I've been a "peskaterian/vegetarian" for over 4 years but upon a recent trip down south decided to indulge in some good ol' southern BBQ, and well... I'm a little lax in the meat eating department now. At least when it comes quality, well cooked, BBQ. You wont see me scarfing down a McRib, or eating meat anywhere else for that matter but give me some Black Dog pulled pork and I'll make an exception. You walk in and write your name and party number on the sheet. I've been here twice now and it was spot on both times. You'll have to wait a little unless you get take out but it's worth it.They have different specials each night and tend to run out of stuff so go early if you have your heart set on the burnt ends (I've yet to try them because they were sold out both times). First time I got the 1/2 rack of ribs with mac & cheese, and coleslaw.Second time they only had 1/4 rack of ribs so I got the pick two with the pulled pork, coleslaw, and baked beans. Pulled pork was amazing! Tender and smokey, and full of flavor. That will be my go to order now. Mac and cheese is indulgent and delicious, coleslaw is of the vinegar (not creamy) variety which I love. Baked beans (they call them something else) were good, but too heavy for me personally. I'd eat them again though. The ribs were my favorite until I tried the pulled pork. They're still a close second.I could be a good vegetarian and the get the portabello sandwich with fresh chevre and roasted red pepper that sounds amazing, and maybe I will one day when my conscience overcomes me. But there's something for everyone there, so non-meat eaters will be just as satisfied I'm sure.

<Content> I was in town for business and the Black Dog was suggested by some of the locals. I ended up going two nights in a row. The first night I had the hot Polish sausage and the catfish. I'm not normally much of a fish eater, but it was so good I ended up having the catfish the second night as well, along with the brisket. The meats were perfectly cooked and so smoky and juicy that you really didn't need the sauces for either the flavor or moisture, although their sauces could have a review of their own. For the sides, I tried the smoked sweet potato, the cornbread, and the pit baked beans. I'm always looking for baked beans with great flavor and most of the time I'm disappointed with sweet flavored beans that taste like they've come from the store. Black Dog's beans are the best I've had anywhere and I would go back just for the beans alone.  The smoky cornbread was exceptional, and the smoked sweet potato with just a touch of butter and brown sugar was amazing. Whenever I visit the Champaign-Urbana area (and by area I mean anywhere within a hundred miles!), the Black Dog will be my first stop for dinner.

<Content> Might be the best BBQ joint in the Central Illinois area.Having relocated to Kansas City, the BBQ capital of the nation, and eating Oklahoma Joe's on a regular basis, Black Dogs would be a HUGE competitor in the KC area. It's a close 2 or 3 in my BBQ book (OK Joe's being number 1). For just being in a college town, I wish this restaurant got more publicity because their recipe is ROCK solid. I miss it every time I'm thinking of visiting my Alma Mater.Their ribs and burnt ends are my favorite. I like my meat fatty, and these meats are marbled well, and smoked well. The corn bread is also phenomenal. It's pretty big (I usually split with one other person). Lastly the sauce: everyone I've tried is true to its name. Try Carolina Red for a kick or Georgia Peach for some sweet sauce.

<Content> Average meat, creative and tasty sides, disappointing sauces. I was impressed that they pack the place as soon as the doors open and start a waiting list. The meat was what I would expect from a BBQ place but without a good sauce I was disappointed. I tried 3 and didn't like any of them.

<Content> Cool little place...the pork was amazing and close to what legends are made of. However, the brisket was less than legendary. Based on what I'd heard and read I expected the meat to be on point and have some passion infused into it. Pork - The pork had great flavor, was cooked perfectly and didn't have a single piece of gristle in it. It went well with any of the sauces (I had the flight)Brisket - A disappointment. It was either an inferior cut of meat or it was cooked wrong. I could barely pull it apart with my hands as it was tough. Once I finally got it apart it was tough and chewy.. It seemed like it had decent flavor in it, but was overshadowed by the texture of it. Sides - baked beans - very good.. had a bit of bacon in them and had great flavor. Applesauce - I wanted something light and this hit the spot. Its applesauce, not much to screw up. Sauces - I liked the chipotle bbq. It had great flavor and a little bit of spice. The texas bbq and milo's mustard were also my favorites.. good all around flavor. I didn't care for the peach ones, but to each his own, the others were good as well . I travel thru here for work so I'll swing by again and give it another whirl, but I'll probably steer clear of the brisket for a bit.. maybe I"ll try the burnt ends? Till next time.

<Content> So everyone told me this was the best place to go when I visited the area. And I really want to give 3.5 stars but since I can't do that, I rounded down mainly because the brisket we got really was dry....and for a BBQ place with that much hype I was really kind of sad inside to get dry brisket...WE REALLY wish we had gotten the burnt ends, but they were sold out by the time we got seated...next time and I am sure that would have caused me to round up instead of down from 3.5 stars...The cornbread with pork in the cornbread, however, is genius! So so good and it added a little more moisture. I definitely need to try making it that way at home. And the pulled pork was also decent especially paired with one of their sweeter BBQ sauces that we got. The catfish was probably my favorite though which is surprising since I don't even normally order fish at a BBQ place, but here I was and I had heard it was good, and it actually was pretty good!The mac and cheese was only okay as well in my obsessiveness over anything with cheese and in particular mac and cheese, but the cornbread and catfish were the winners for me!

<Content> This place is goood!The meat is always fresh and tender and cooked just right. Everything I've ordered there, on multiple occasions, has been spot on and smoked just right. It's pretty interesting to see such a place in tiny downtown Champaign. The place looks and smells awesome too. Once you enter into the tiny grunge-designed restaurant, the smokey smell of meats will serve as an early indication that you've come to the right place. The only issue with Black Dog is the wait. It's such a tiny place that if you go there at most times of the day, you will have to wait a good deal for your table. I had to sometimes resort to ordering out; however, when you're not in too much of a hurry, the ambience will convince you to stick around.

<Content> Here we go again. The best part about work travel is they pick up the tab!Anyhow... By looking at the exterior of this place I would have never guessed it to harbor a BBQ-haven within. I arrived in on a rainy early afternoon and was surprised to see still a bit of a crowd. In hindsight, this is probably a sign that the Urbana folk love this place- and warranted.I was promptly seated at the bar and happy to see that they have an EXPANSIVE option of bourbon and rye to choose from; even some high quality stuff like Bookers. Additionally they had a good handful of on-tap options covering a variety of beer types. The bartender wasn't the warm and fuzzytype, however he was very prompt, attentive, and professional. I opted for the combo of two; 1/4 rack of ribs and beef brisket. For sides, corn bread and twice baked mashed potatoes. I'll have to say each were very flavorful with thee own unique taste. These both are definitely someone's home receipe and I approve. The cornbread itself is hearty and flavorful enough to TRUELY qualify as a side.Overall this is a great place without the steep price you generally run accross in a BBQ joint (that's including the bourbons). The quality to price ratio definitely leaves the patron winning in this transaction. Well don't Black Dog.... Well done.

<Content> I am a BBQ fanatic, and I give every place at least one shot at winning me over. Let's just say Black Dog will be seeing a lot more of me! Our waitress was very helpful, happy and gave us good tips on what was good (apparently everything, from what we tried. The ribs were great. Pulled pork was really good. The sauces were "OK", but I could see myself learning to like them more. I didn't notice much dry rub, but it's a good sign when ribs aren't drowned in sauce. I liked their french fries a lot and my wife loved the twice baked potato casserole. Can't comment on the drink selection or bar. Overall it's a tight space and has a hip vibe, being in a university town you expect that usually. The bartender with the TIGHT fro (respect) was energized and really brought an upbeat vibe to the post lunch hour rush. Overall Black Dog was really good, bordering on great, for Illinois BBQ places, and I've been to a lot. We'll be back soon...

<Content> This small eatery is generally very busy so be prepared to wait, especially at dinner hour. IT IS WELL WORTH THE WAITDon't forget to go inside and put your name in the chalkboard.This is by far the BEST barbecue ever. Huge serving of pulled pork, brisket, several combo plates. Did I mention the sides. corn bread with pulled pork inside, loaded potato casserole, coleslaw like granny used to make! Smoky, tender, juicy! Several sauces to choose from-- from mild to HOT- ask for a sample or get the flyte offering to shareSeveral says a week Black Dog offers smoked turkey. It is amazing!If you are lucky you might get the " burnt ends". So far they are out each time I have visited. Decor is funky. Staff have all been excellent. Just the right balance of attention and very friendly, even on super busy Friday nights!!Try it. You will become a Black Dog addict!!

<Content> I recently moved away from Urbana and had to bid farewell to Black Dog (at least inasmuch as I will be able to go there frequently). I never bothered to review Black Dog on Yelp because, frankly, what is there to add to the veritable torrent of 5-star reviews here.Last week, though, I had occasion to travel to Kansas City (the self-proclaimed BBQ capital of the world) and made every effort to take in the best the city had to offer (a set of restaurants that naturally varies greatly depending on the Kansas City resident being asked). I had ribs and brisket at Oklahoma Joe's (in the gas station); ribs and burnt ends at Arthur Bryant's; and ribs and a burnt end sandwich at Q39. All were good, some even great (Q39 especially), but--and here is the point of my review--I found myself thinking constantly of Black Dog even as I was downing these admittedly famous and stellar BBQ items.Black Dog, in my mind, is really unmatched in its ability to offer outstanding BBQ at all times of the day and across the entire menu. From the ribs and burnt ends to the pulled pork, pulled rib sandwich, pulled chicken, and brisket, everything is truly wonderful. The sides, too--from the twice-baked potato to the pit beans--are excellent.I will admit that Kansas City's Q39 beat Black Dog in one area: ribs. The ribs at Q39 were quite simply the best I've ever had. But, even at Q39, I found myself wishing for every other aspect of Black Dog: the sides (which were sorely lacking everywhere in Kansas City), the price, and the other BBQ items. Writing this is the only way I could think of to add something new to the many compliments and superlatives about Black Dog on Yelp. So yes: even after a BBQ journey to KC, I remain steadfast in my belief that Black Dog is, hands down, the best BBQ restaurant out there. It doesn't get caught up in or weighed down by tradition or legacy. Instead, it has every aspect of BBQ honed to perfection and is clearly the result of careful planning by the owners, taking as they must have the best elements of BBQ throughout the U.S. and putting them together under the moniker Black Dog Smoke and Ale House.

<Content> I think this place is good, and I enjoy going here, but I don't think it's the best BBQ I've ever had.The meat is cooked well, smoky and tender, but the thing that doesn't do it for me is the sauce (there's a few choices). I haven't tried them all, but I haven't found one I like.The side dishes are quite good though, namely the cornbread, beans (so smoky and delicious) and sweet potato fries. This place is small and always packed, so be prepared to get there when it first opens or during non-peak times (or just be prepared to wait, in other words, stand against the wall and watch others eat three feet in front of you).

<Content> Simply the tops. Black Dog presents to you the best BBQ in a 50-state area. Its welcoming and knowledgeable staff will serve you a rotating cast of beers and a stable of meats and sauces that rivals anywhere you've ever been. The burnt ends are probably considered to be the specialty here, and they're typically out of them by 1 or 2 due to the popularity, but the true specialty is just outstanding, mouthwatering food. Aside from the everyday options of pulled pork, brisket, ribs and catfish, they also have great daily specials, such as pork tacos on Tuesday and an incredible cuban sandwich on Wednesday. And not to be forgotten, the sides and appetizers are killer as well.The long wait at usual dinner and lunch hours is well documented, but there is a wait because everyone who's heard of the place dreams of eating all of their meals there, all of the time.If you're stopping in for the first time, you'll never go wrong with a cornbread appetizer, sides of pit beans and twice baked potato casserole, and pulled pork with the georgia peach sauce.

<Content> So... wow... this place was busy.I came to this place on a Wednesday night before the dinner rush and there was still a wait. The wait wasn't too bad, there was about 20-30 minutes before we were seated. This was at 5:45 pm. This place is apparently packed every night. So if you come here expect a wait... But wait. It's very worth it. So you walk up to free outside of this place and you can already smell the bbq smokey goodness. It only gets better from here. If you can get lucky enough to wait inside during a hot summer day... You're already doing pretty well. So you finally have a table. Grab a menu and order the burnt ends sandwich... I've never had anything like this before. I've had a lot of bbq coming from the south and living here the majority of my life. But the beef brisket here is amazing. It's more tender than any other beef brisket... drool... order it with the Carolina Red sauce. So good. Soooo good. The sweet potato fries are also good too. Corn bread... mmmm. The only thing that I could have done without is the slaw. Meh... I've had much better slaw, but in the sandwich is good. It compliments the rest of the flavors. Can we get back to that beef brisket? The end... get the burnt ends sandwich. That is all...

<Content> Three words: worth the wait.Okay, that's five words total, so I'll just add that I awarded 4 stars instead of 5 because we waited for an hour at lunch time. The second location can't come soon enough!When we were finally seated, Hubby was sad that they were already out of pulled rib sandwiches, so he got the burnt tip sandwich instead. One bite, and he was ready to die happy--that's all it took.The portions are ample but don't overdo it. Slaw is acceptable, but I like Native Foods' herbed sweet potato fries better. I thought the menu was short on vegetables, but I guess folks come here for the meat and carbs, eh? Word to the wise: even the cornbread has meat in it!

<Content> This is the new place to go in Champaign for a casual bbq eats.First off.. the beer sampler is the way to go. I was impressed with six beers for barely anything.Second.. the waiters are friendly but they definitely didn't offer the best advice on food. The person I was with greatly advised that we get the appetizers: burnt ends (which is basically brisket and was really delicious but spicy) and cornbread (good but I've had better).Tried the get two platter.. the catfish is dry and I would definitely skip it. I would have gotten brisket again but I wanted to be adventurous and went for the pulled pork. Meh.. it's okay. I had the Georgia Peach bbq sauce which was sweet but spicy.As for drinks.. the white Manhattan was not good. Then they were out of all vermouth so they couldn't really make me an Old Fashioned or anything else for that matter. I think I had a Cosmopolitan. Ummmm.. it wasn't that good either. Probably best to stick with beer at this spot.

<Content> I can see why this place gets a lot of hype. The food is really delicious--all aspects; I have not been disappointed.So far I've tried the beef brisket and pulled pork; along with the twice-baked potato casserole, and sweet potato fries.The cornbread does have pulled pork in it but it's not the most amazing thing I've had. It's alright, I thought the flavor would be more apparent but it was just okay.It can take the LONGEST time to get a seat but that's okay. So far our servers have been kind, except one time where we had such a horrid experience with one waitress who was just in the worst mood. Otherwise, we had another server who was much nicer.I need to go back!

<Content> As a teacher in Central Illinois, it doesn't really get much better than summer! I moved down here for weather like this! This place is on Broadway Avenue, adjacent to the Bunny Tavern (which I think is associated with this place...I mean, they were advertising the Bunny Tavern's Duck Fat Fries on Sunday in the Black Dog Window). I wish Black Dog had outdoor seating like Bunny Tavern, but onto the BBQ!One would just assume when dining with a former beauty pageant queen that I would have to practice proper manners and not eat with my hands. I will divulge on this a little later, but keep this in mind!I arrived about 12:15 and I knew there be a wait......about 15 minutes! It was perfect because my friend Elsie, the aforementioned former beauty queen and fellow PE teacher was across town.It was like clockwork! She showed up and we were seated! NICE!Rather than be overwhelmed by all the options of barbecue Nirvana, I did my research via Yelp and Noshfolio. I knew I was getting a combo with 2 sides and two different barbecue sauces. I made a fantastic choice with the smoked chicken and the pulled pork! I got some salad and beans, but the highlight of the meal was the chicken FALLING off the bone. Falling, like Fall Out Boy or the season after summer...FALL! Remember when I said that it was falling off the bone? One might ask, "How do you know if you were eating with a knife and fork?" I will mention that the chicken came with a thigh that was very difficult to eat with a knife and fork! At this point, Elsie reminded me that she grew up in a family when they had dinner, they sat down and spoke with their mouths full!I started to eat like a savage caveman who hadn't eaten since the wooly mammoth he killed three weeks ago. Elsie ordered their pulled pork sandwich, famous cornbread, and twice baked potato casserole. She couldn't finish and got a to go box.I went with the Texas and the Chipotle sauces. I didn't know the difference, and it didn't help when our waiter didn't tell me which was which! I asked and was glad I did because I had them mixed up! I also wanted to buy a medium t shirt to represent Black Dog in Paxton, but to no avail, they only had larges!I would have given 4.3333333 stars if I could. Assessment is huge as a teacher, but I just can't "round up" because of the service! I will be back to try some of their smoked shrimp (Thursdays), fish tacos (Friday), or late night menu! Hopefully the wait staff has some more females working next time I am there! MERCY! Requirement to work on a Wednesday afternoon at Black Dog? Must have crazy facial hair or short curly black hair! See you soon, dog!

I usually get the pulled pork sandwich with Georgia peach sauce but I've also had rib tips and those are flame too. Only thing that is annoying is the wait and the fact that you can't make a reservation but I guess there's not a lot you can do about that considering it's a super popular place.

<Content> You can smell this amazing BBQ joint from a block away. The smell will draw you in, just don't let the wait scare you away...it is well worth it. Expect to wait about 20-30 minutes maybe longer for bigger groups. The place can seem a bit cramped when the line is long, so try to get a table that isn't next to the door. While you wait, try one of their rotating craft beers. They have a huge selection, as well as, a full-service bar. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the staff are all incredibly friendly and attentive. It seems like a family-run place because of the comforting ambience it alludes. I've heard the Burnt Ends are where it's at, but they go fast! They start serving them at 11am and 5pm so try and get there right at those times. I haven't had the chance to try them yet, as I've always arrived too late (probably my fault, always taking too long to get ready). I have ordered the Beef Brisket Sandwich both times I went to Black Dog and haven't been disappointed yet. I have tried a few different sauces with the brisket and loved them all. My favorite is the house-speciality sauce. The bun it is served on is also super soft. The cornbread is amazing, especially with a little bit of butter. And the twice-baked potato casserole is to die for! It is my favorite appetizer on the menu. The applesauce is also deliciously sweet and you can tell it is homemade. Black Dog is opening a new location in Champaign, our waitress informed us. She said it should hopefully be up and running by Winter 2015.

<Content> 3.5 stars.Had the opportunity to try some takeout from Black Dog recently. As a KC resident, you can bet I'm picky about my Q. Black dog holds up just fine, but doesn't shine.Meat: The pulled pork is probably a 4/5 on its own. It has a deep smokey flavor and great texture - not thin and strandy like some other pulled pork can be - it comes in big hearty strips. The ribs, on the other hand, were just a 3/5 for me: they had decent flavor and a small smoke ring, but the texture was off. It took a good amount of work to pull the meat off the bone and was more chewy rather than tender. The sauce is mediocre; good heat but heavy on the tomato and not a lot of depth.Sides: mashed potatoes are creamy and satisfying, but the fries were limp and dry. I wouldn't get them again.Something about this place just doesn't sit right with the BBQ snob in me. The fact that I would come here and get the pulled pork is telling, I think - it's good, but it is one of the easier cuts of meat to make. Ribs are much harder to get right, and that lack of ability shows through at Black Dog. The biggest reveal? I found that I was uninterested in eating the leftovers later...that rounds Black Dog down to 3 stars for me.

<Content> I'm a Texan just in the area passing through, so I'm a tough critic. That said...their meat was deeelish! I had the (lean) brisket and polish sausage. The brisket was very tender and I'm not used to polish sausage, but I especially liked it with the mustard sauce. We ordered the sauce sampler so we could try them all and I'm glad we did. The mustard was good with the pork and the sausage. Again, being Texan I liked the hotter ones. (Hot Georgia peach, Caroline Red, and Chipotle BBQ. I don't care for vinegar sauces, so be warned their default sauce is Lexington Dip and it's a vinegar one. We had the smoked cornbread as an appetizer and it was great! It's a unique flavor and texture for cornbread, but if you like things smoked I would try it!Only thing I didn't love were the sides. I had the vinegar slaw and potato salad. The family had the pit beans, chipotle slaw and sweet potato fries, they liked theirs...above average fries/beans. Just so/so for mine. The potato salad definitely needed a kick. I put the milo mustard on it and that helped. We were sad they were out of burnt ends! I would go back to have burnt ends and try different sides. Fun place, friendly service and very busy! Our family has always had black labs so we got a good looking baseball Tee souvenir of the "black dog."

<Content> I loved this place! It is delicious! Make sure to come here early though because the lines are long and they will only seat your party is complete.We ordered the ribs with the peach sauce. The ribs were yummie but were not fall off the bone type. Despite this, the meat was still very tender. With the ribs came two sides. I opted for the spicy potato salad and the sweet potato fries. I liked both the sides but I think I enjoyed the spicy potato salad more.The corn bread is its own beast. It is OUTSTANDING. It is definitely corn bread you probably have never tasted anywhere else. They put moist sweet pork meat in it!!!! What a wonderful surprise. I could eat a bunch of it up!Overall food was good, service was good, and our food came out fast. A great experience! Looking forward to a return visit!

<Content> My biggest problem here was expectations everyone had set the bar so high. So I was expecting something much better than I was. Wasn't terrible. But wouldn't say it's the best second-best in the nation I had the Two meet combo with pork ribs and pulled pork. The ribs were okay. Nothing special. And the meat involved on. I'm not a fan of vinegar barbecue sauce. So the Georgia peach was my favorite. The cornbread was good. The atmosphere was really cool. Overall Its too bad the expectations were so high I think I would've liked it better.

<Content> Best place in Champaign-Urbana to sit down, relax, and enjoy a great meal. Food is top-notch. I've tried the pulled pork, the ribs, the catfish, and their shrimp po' boy and will vouch for them all personally. The cornbread is moist and has some fun little bits of meat and beans in. I like to order the fries and slaw as sides -- people always come for the barbecue (and rightly so), but I think their fries are also the best in town. On top of everything, the staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming and laid-back. A must-visit if you are in the area, and worth the wait that you will almost certainly endure (even in the bitter cold of an Illinois winter).One note: they've recently switched their default sauce from the somewhat-spicy Carolina Red to a milder, liquid sauce. I have no complaints about the new one, but I prefer the Carolina Red, and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a serious to near-fatal aversion to spicy food.

<Content> Gud grub, excellent corn bread. In fact, it's the best I've ever had. I ordered the 3-meat combo platter. I chose 1/4 slab ribs, brisket, & pulled pork, cuz they were out of Burnt Ends :( Also, u hav a choice of 5 sauces, I went with the fruity/cue-y Georgia Peach sauce. I also had a Nitro brew which was great cuz they don't leave you with the fullness of a regular beer. -1* for the gas taste of the pulled pork. Will definitely b bak!

I definitely didn't intend on eating as much as I did but I just couldn't stop myself.I was recommended to try Black Dog by former U of I students and I will definitely be returning when I'm traveling to Champaign for work.

<Content> By far the best bbq in Central Illinois. (been here twice drove all the way from Bloomington)Brisket had a good smoke, bark and flavor. While no where near the quality of TX brisket or even Smoque in Chicago, they were still better than anything you'll find at most locations outside of TX. Pork was a bit bland but still good especially with their sauces.  Ribs were a bit tough, needed just a bit more time on the smoker but overall pretty good.  They had an unusual spice that I couldn't quite place though. I haven't tried the burnt ends yet, found out they serve them at 11am and 5pm and run out in about an hour. I hear these are their best bbq item will be back to try them. We also tried their chips and salsa they were great, it had good kick (which was kind of a bad thing since the waitress sucked at refilling drinks) my only complaint is that it was billed as smokey salsa and I could not detect any smoke to the salsa. Sides I've tried Pinto beans - mediocreSmoked sweet potato - ok but not great. corn bread - goodFrench fries - goodA couple more comments - this place is a small restaurant\bar. Due to the size it stays packed and forces a long wait. (you have to sign your name and can be seated at a table or the bar) We waited an hour each time.  If it wasn't for the scarcity of quality bbq this place wouldn't be worth the wait. (In central TX this place would get 2 stars)Since it is geared more as a restaurant you don't get to talk directly to the meat cutter, the waitstaff wasn't knowledgeable enough about barbecue to relay my wants to the cutter.  So last time when I ordered my brisket "moist with extra bark" it came out lean with very little bark. One of the kitchen staff "Kyle" was awesome and provided great service, when there was a mistake on our order. He mentioned they are working on opening a larger joint this fall hopefully it will cut down on the wait while not affecting the quality of food.

<Content> Pretty awesome BBQ and service.The wait is worth it. Even though I made sure to go at a time where I wouldn't have to wait. haha.We got in and our waiter was very polite and liked to joke around. After traveling around Europe for a few months, it was nice to come back to the US and be reminded about how nice people are in the Midwest.There were a lot of choices for sides and especially BBQ sauces.I got the beef brisket with fries and cornbread. The brisket was moist and not chewy at all. I was satisfied. I would have to say that my favorite part of the meal was the cornbread. It practically had a whole BBQ meal in it. There was meat, beans and it tasted amazing with the butter spread.I would definitely go back again before I graduate.

<Content> I have been here twice and don't live in town, but I've already asked my girlfriend if we can celebrate my birthday here... which is 6 months away.Last night we went in, and signed the waiting list, and we were immediately offered seats at the bar. I get the feeling the booths are most likely held for parties of 3 or more, which makes sense since space is so valuable here. Anyway we don't mind and our bartender Carly made me two of the tastiest old fashions I've ever had, I've had the burnt ends sandwich twice now and it's the best BBQ I've ever had. They have enough BBQ sauces for every palette, vinegary ones, sweet ones, hot, mild, and all the ones I've had were delicious. The corn bread was so fresh and delicious. Might try to convince my girlfriend to go back tonight...

<Content> The best smoked meat in the area, hands down. Love the ends, brisket and pulled pork. I get the sweet Georgia peach sauce because I'm pretty much a light weight on hot food. It's perfect for me. The cornbread is by far my favorite thing on the menu. Yes, I have purchased just that. Always ask for more butter, though!They do take-out really well, which is nice since they're always so busy. Everything is wrapped individually and easily reheated. Service is always great. Beers are pretty good. So why the four stars? Partly because I can't give 4.5...but mostly because I LOVE a bloody Mary, and theirs are just terrible. I've tried x3 with no success. They taste overwhelmingly of actual bbq sauce and meat. Like a liquid dinner platter. If that's your thing, go for the 5 stars.

<Content> There is lots to love here, but also lots that is just average. The building is awesome. Right in downtown Urbana. A long wood bar with booths along the perimeter. Tiled floors, and a great worn in pub feel. The service is friendly and they know the menu. Food and beer come out relatively quickly.The beer selection is nice. About 8 rotating taps of quality micros from around the nation and some Belgians as well. They also have a rotating cask which is great. Plenty of bottles as well. I enjoyed Summit Oatmeal Stout on cask.All fine and good, but the food left something to be desired for me. I wanted the burnt ends sandwich. They were out, that is not a problem at all. It is great that they can go through the good stuff like that. I ended up with a half rack of pork spare ribs. The ribs are very good. I did enjoy them, but not great. I do not like the BBQ sauce at all. it is like a tomato paste, almost marinara like. The sides are crap though. Mac and cheese seemed like it was sitting out forever. Similar to old mac and cheese that has been sitting out and hardened for hours after Christmas diner. The slaw seemed almost rancid. I could not eat it. Luckily I did not get a sandwich that would have been covered in it.Overall, I really wanted to love this place. The meat is very good though not great, and got to love the beer selection. As well as a very nice Bourbon selection. Though overall, I think the reviews here are a bit of a home town bias. I will continue to support these guys, but not up to the hype I had been expecting.

<Content> Black Dog is almost always perfect. They do a wonderful Carolina-style BBQ which focuses on vinegar, spice and smoke, not so much on sweetness. Everything I've ordered has been good, but my go-to is the 2-meat combo platter, which comes with 2 sides and is a great value for the amount of food you get (I always leave feeling stuffed, and I can eat a lot). If you're into catfish, try the catfish with mustard sauce; I never get tired of it. When they have them, the beef ribs are fantastic. There is a good variety of beers on tap, and the selection is constantly changing; there is usually something for everyone. I've found their cocktails to be overly-sweet, but to be fair I've only tried a few. As everyone has mentioned, lines can be long, but the wait is worth it, especially in the summer when it's not painful to stand outside. The only bad experience I've had with waitstaff was once when a friend was asked how his beer was and he said it wasn't what he expected and then got interrogated rather uncomfortably by the waiter about what he meant. Usually everyone is fairly pleasant, even when the restaurant is packed and hectic. As others have also mentioned, if you want burnt ends go early!

Just thinking about you is making my mouth water!This is a great joint in your are looking for some solid BBQ  They also have a nice selection of microbrews. Get ready to wait though... We went at 3pm on Saturday and we still waited for a solid 20 minutes! Though the wait during peak lunch and dinner hours is way worse... It's almost painful watching plates of mouthwatering meats pass by you while you stand there helplessly. But trust me, the wait is worth it!

<Content> Came here after my friends all raved about it. We arrived and there was a brief wait. I figured, hmmm...there are people here...that's a good sign. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Here's what I got:-combination platter with catfish, brisket, sweet potato fries, and double baked potatoes (for how much I paid I was expecting a larger portion; brisket was good; the catfish had an odd taste and odor - didn't really care for it; I had to pay extra for the sweet potato fries but it came with like 5 fries!! Grr. The twice baked potatoes were ok but suuuuuuper small cup of it)-burnt ends (DELISH)The food was a disappointment but the service was even worst! The server asked how the daiquiri was and my friend said it wasn't what she expected and he pounced on her interrogating her for why she didn't like it. IM SORRRY YOUR DRINKS AREN'T GOOD. You never attack the customer! So rude. He should've apologized and offered her another drink. Later he asked about the food and we mentioned the catfish and he had the same reaction! I was stunned. Overall, the food and service left much more to be desired...

<Content> Black Dog you are the top dog! We came here after a game and fell on the food like hungry little puppies. I had a ribs and burnt ends both of which were fabulous. I also adored the twice baked potato casserole which I learned about from other Yelp reviews. They even made another batch for us, how terrific!My only issue is that it is always crowded. So I suggest that you double the size of the place or keep a table that is always available just for me. Thanks!

<Content> What can I say that hasn't been said before? I met my boss here for lunch on a sunny Monday afternoon. We were quickly greeted by we had 2 more people yet to show up so we had to wait for them to be seated.As soon as our party was there, we were quickly ushered to a table and greeted by our server. He informed us that he had been overhearing our conversations at the table and was happy to report that they did have burnt ends and explained to one of my lunch mates what a mufelleta was and what it was made of today. This was a great touch - what an easy way to make a quick and easy impression on a table!So, I got my burnt ends sandwich, along with sweet potato fries - which I had been told were AMAZING. I also ordered their beans.We also ordered the cornbread... which was delish!!! I recommend it highly. It was moist, slightly spicy... and full of amazingness!The burnt end sandwich was increds. Cooked to perfection and flavored wonderfully with a Carolina Red sauce.The sweet potato fries weren't amazing - they were AH-MAY-ZING!!!!!The beans were delish as well - and did not need for me to add in any sauce or anything, which is my usual habit.I have to say... I have been coming to central Illinois for years and I am pissed it took until today for me to get to this place.I will be back... probably every trip to central Illinois!!!

Everything there is divine.Obviously no place for vegans, but they do have vegetarian options if you do get dragged to a smokehouse!

<Content> Ok, I know what you're thinking. Good barbecue in Illinois? Yes. Absolutely. This is some of the best bbq I have ever had. When you first walk in, you are to write your first name and party number on a white board and wait to be seated. The wait was not too bad, but we came on a Monday for lunch. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. Our waitress was very friendly and didn't mind suggesting things. Try the burnt ends. Delicious. The twice baked potato casserole was excellent too. It was all great. I only give it a 4 star because of the seating. It's a little crammed, but it won't affect your dining experience at all.

<Content> If you want to eat at a glorious cavern of mustachioed waiters, succulent meats and flavorful sides (that might contribute to well-worth-it wait gain) look no further. Black Dog Smoke & Ale House offers up some of the best pulled pork to have ever graced my taste buds. If you make it in time to enjoy the glorious burnt ends, first thank the gods, and then savor the flavors because you may never have the chance to taste them again. All in all, if you are willing to wait to get a seat you won't be disappointed.

<Content> I felt like I was cheating as we drove by Hickory River, so I looked away. Parking at Black Dog is sketchy - this time the lot was a sheet of ice. But we got right in, only waiting 5 minutes for a table at 6pm.We split way too many apps, but everything looked so darn good!! Smoked almonds (house smoked, with a touch of sweetness - love, especially for $3!), wings (expensive but OK, with sauce that catches up with you around wing #3), Texas caviar (with black eyed peas and hominy - very nice) and chips and salsa (meh). Drinks all around too. I had a bloody mary made with horseradish vodka (yum) and a margarita made with hoppy tequila (yum!!!).I ordered a combo plate. $12 for your choice of two meats (I had burnt ends and pulled pork) and two sides (spicy potato salad and pit beans - both delish). Really good amount of food for the price! Others at my table had the brisket (dry), sweet potato fries (an upcharge but very worth it if you're a fan of them), the burger with brisket, sauce, onions and cheese on it (she loved it) and the twice-baked potato casserole (everyone wanted to lick this bowl clean).This was my first time trying burnt ends, and I must say I was disappointed. I expected blackened meat all around, like I've seen on the Food Network, and these were just the black ring around brisket that I normally get... when I order brisket.We all loved the potato salad and the potato casserole. In fact, we loved all the sides and apps. If there was a way to get just a plate of sides, I'd never leave.Hopping place! A constant waiting line, on a Tuesday. Good service, but a little scatterbrained.

<Content> The four stars is because of the food, I really like barbecue and theirs was smoky good. I had the ribs and pulled pork and both were great. My side of Mac n Cheese was also very very good.But I am going to dog on Black dog for the place itself. The food was fairly expensive yet you are in a physically uncomfortable environment. If it's a bar, why are they serving such good food? If it's a restaurant why are the seats and tables so crappy? Plus the lines are really long, would bar patrons want to wait that long? And if they are there for a bar aren't they going to take up seats for a long time so people can't eat?I like the food but the concept seems pretty conflicted. Work it out, be a bar or a restaurant and accommodate one set of customers. I hope it's the restaurant with new seating. Arf arf.

<Content> We are always looking for a new place in the Chambana area during football season and somehow Black Dog had eluded us. Luckily I ran into a friend who opened our eyes. We went to the ASU night game and after a long night of cheering we were hungry! We arrived around 9:30 / 10:00 pm and the place was still pretty full. When we sat down the server announced that they were out of quite a few menu items. We weren't shy about our disappointment and a little bit later the server told us they were going to make more of the twice baked potato casserole. Hooray! Oh and they were DELICIOUS!Everything was so good. The bbq has more of a smoked flavor which I really like. I ordered the pulled pork with the house sauce. The sauce was a bit spicy (I am a wimp) but I did sample some others that I liked. I can't wait to go back to try some burnt ends and some other sauces.

<Content> Their pulled pork is DIVINE, very tender and sauced to perfection. They butter their buns and add some 'slaw in the sandwich. I gladly had it twice in 3 days. Like Goldilocks who found the perfect bbq... not too spicy, not too dry, perfectly tangy, the meat was juicy, everything was just right. And that's why I keep going back.It's located in an unsuspecting, little brick building but it's packed at meal times throughout the week no matter what day. They have random pieces of art on the wall I mistakenly took for coat hangers... but the servers are pretty good at seating you and there's a great atmosphere. Clients licking their fingers, loving their food, and servers knowing their food is prized. Don't waste your time on the spicy potato salad, but pair your meal with sweet tea, sweet potato fries or amazing smoked beans. They don't joke around with their smoked flavor. I have never tasted such 'smokiness' ever.They ran out of brisket and the pulled chicken, but i guess that's what happens when everything tastes like home-cooked goodness. I'll be back very soon to try their rib tips and wings.

<Content> Been eyeing this places for a while and finally hit town early enough to get in the door. Little did I know the burnt ends become available at 5 p.m. After a short wait, I was able to get some ends, chicken and ribs. All were moist and smokey and excellent. They offer a wide variety of sauces, well beyond the typical hot, sweet, ketchup you find at most places. The beans were the perfect side, while the fries were just OK. A small but varied craft lineup and a bigger/better selection of whiskey (Pappy 20) left more drink options than I could even imagine sampling in one visit. A return trip is definitely in order. Just make sure you're here before 5.

<Content> I went here for the first time a couple days ago. When people told me about there being a big line at the door, they weren't lying. We were expecting 5 people to show for dinner and so I signed the paper at the front for 5. When one didn't show up the waitress informed me that everyone needed to be present in order to be seated and that nobody could join your table at a later time. On to the food: I had the beef brisket platter with corn bread and their beans. Both sides were absolutely amazing. I tried a little of my sister's potato salad...I think and it was great as well. As far as the brisket goes, I kind of expected it to be seasoned better. It was very tender and perfectly cooked but I thought it would have seasoning aside from the BBQ sauce served in a separate dipping cup. All things considered I give the food as a whole 4.5 stars, the service gets 3.5 stars because the waitress seemed a bit short when she stated the seating policy. True there was a sign at the front, but I didn't see it because the place was crowded. Maybe put multiple signs up. Please hurry and get your second location going!

<Content> I try to eat here whenever I visit my daughter at U of I. By far the best barbecue in central Illinois and for me it rivals great BBQ joints from Texas. Brisket is excellent along with a spicy BBQ sauce on the side. Good ribs and the smoked catfish is fantastic. I usually get the combo platter of brisket and smoked catfish along with two tasty sides. You can't go wrong with any of the sides, but my favorite is the sweet potato fries. Nice beer selection, and if you want to feel like you're hanging out and eating BBQ in Austin, they have Shiner and Lone Star in bottles.Only catch...the place is so popular and so good (and so small) that wait times can be very long. Come for an afternoon meal on weekends and your wait shouldn't be too bad.

<Content> If I could, I would eat here every day. Here are some pointers in case you want a taste of heaven.- Don't pass up the sweet potato fries- Dine in, it's worth the wait - you'll leave smelling like BBQ and they'll overload your tray with fries- Ask to try other sauces - they're more than willing to accommodate your curious taste buds- Get 2 orders of their pork belly special on Saturdays, cause they're closed on Sundays- Its hard for me to order anything else but burnt ends- Seating is limited...VERY limited- Go for late lunch or early dinner, otherwise you'll find yourself in a line out the door- TRY THE CORN BREAD. Best corn bread I've ever had - cheese and pulled pork baked into it! My mom doesn't let me come into the house unless I bring her at least 4 orders of this stuff when I come home from school.

<Content> I'm skeptical of suggestions.Really, it's more I don't know you, you don't know me, how do you know what I might enjoy or have a taste for?In this case I'm glad I put aside my thoughts on the matter, followed the bartender's suggestion and got the Burnt Ends. Speaking of which, you don't know me and I don't know you but you should get it. Really. It's an awesome smoked and resmoked brisket sandwich that is so many layers of delicious, it's stupid. It's juicy, flavorful and the sauce is done just right; present but not overwhelming. The slaw is a correctly done supporting cast in the sandwich. Also, coming it at around $7, it was easily tastier than more expensive crap I've paid for out here on the West Coast.Combine this hunger inducing (and curing) sandwich with a delightful Dark Horse Tres Blueberry Stout enjoyed on draft (not to mention the availability of a number of craft beers on draft and in bottle) and the chill atmosphere and I was more than happy I braved the rain to visit this spot before heading back to Chicago.Even if it wasn't in Urbana, this place would be able to hang in any big city either as just a beer bar or as a BBQ place. I'll thank my lucky stars it does both.

<Content> There seems to be a unanimous vote for Black Dog as the best restaurant in Chambana... I'm sorry but I don't see it. I've been there over a dozen times and the only item on the menu I LOVED was the cornbread (full of pulled pork) -- Delicious!!! Everything else is just "meh". This is descent BBQ, but I definitely wouldn't say it's amazing or anything. As a matter of fact, their burgers and most side-dishes are absolutely a waste of money! Also, I've tried all of their BBQ sauces and the only one I really liked was the sweet GA peach, the rest are not that good.I was a bit torn on how to rate this restaurant -- they have descent BBQ, I absolutely love the cornbread, but I hate waiting in line, and I find their snooty "we're the best restaurant in town" attitude EXTREMELY off-putting!

<Content> This is good bbq folks! In Champaign/Urbana whodda thunk? First time visit had pulled pork, burnt ends, cole slaw and bbq beans. Meat was plenty flavorful, and not dried out. In fact the burnt ends were remarkably not dry. Lots of smoky flavor, so good. In my opinion, what makes really good bbq is some attention to sides, and these absolutely did not dissapoint. Slaw was crispy, fresh and savory. Good balance of flavors and not too sweet or creamy. Beans were equally well done, really savory and again seemingly devoid of the too much sugar syndrome of extremely mediocre bbq joints. This place is soooo not a mediocre joint, cant wait to get a chance to go back!to

<Content> If you only want volume and value, you can go to Lil' Porgy's. If you want fast, mediocre BBQ, Hickory River is a bit further north.But if you want amazing BBQ and equally inspired sides in an unmatched atmosphere, go to Black Dog. It's the best BBQ you can get in the area (dare I say Illinois?): pulled pork, ribs, brisket, chicken, it's all good. The ambiance is unmatched. Large TV's above the bar if you want to watch something or a warm, inviting seating area if you wanna talk. A huge selection of craft beers. And to top it off, seasonal, local specials (I once had the smoked beet salad, which was glorious).Take my word for it, the wait isn't that bad. If you want to go out for great food with an old acquaintance, a business meeting with the roommates or perhaps a casual date with the designated lady/gentleman friend, Black Dog will always do you right.

<Content> This place is without a doubt, the BEST BBQ IN ILLINOIS. My boyfriend went to U of I and we somehow stumbled upon this hidden gem. Well, I suppose it's not so hidden since there is usually a long wait. But don't be discouraged! The wait is well worth it, I promise. Try to make your way through the door, find the guy in charge, and put your name on the list. There's not much space in this place. I guess that would be my one complaint. It can get pretty crunched, especially if you're waiting. However, what is better to tide you over than a delicious beer? Now, let's talk about this beer.They have new selections on tap all the time. Please, do your beer pallet a favor and don't order the usual domestics and imports (Miller, Bud, Heiniken, Corona, etc). Those are just fine for any regular restaurant. Why miss the glorious opportunity to try something mind-blowingly good? Seriously, these beers are amazing. They come from different breweries across the country. Places/companies you've never heard of. Combinations of flavors you would never think to try. I once had an oyster beer here. Sounds disgusting but it was so good. Trust me on that. I'm very picky and I liked it. You can also get a flight of 7 beers on a dogbone shaped tray (how fitting!). This flight has all the beers that are on tap in 4 oz glasses. You can share them with a friend and then order the one you like best!Now, on to the food. So SO good. There are a few different sauce choices you can get. Not being one for spicy, I get the Georgia Peach. It is soo good on anything you get. There is no bad item on this menu. The pulled pork is amazing as are the hamburgers. Hard to believe a hamburger could be so good, but it is. The brisket is also amazing. They cook it for 12 hours. How could it not be? Try to get here relatively early though, because some items like the brisket run out later in the evening. While it's a bummer, think of it as a good thing. This way, you know they're not just heating it in the microwave. They cook it, and once it's gone, it's gone. Oh and the fries are amazing, whether you get the regular or sweet potato.I know this was a long review, but I really can't say enough about this place. I'm obsessed. It's a bummer that my bf graduated so we can't go all the time since we live near Chicago. However, I will make any excuse to go down. Going there this weekend for Halloween. Can't wait to visit my favorite BBQ place in all the land!

<Content> Black Dog is by far the best BBQ in the chambana area and, in my opinion, one of the best (maybe the best) restaurant in chambana. I might be biased since I love BBQ and, as I said, this place definitely has the best BBQ in the area. I've been coming here regularly for 3 years and I have never been disappointed.A heads up to anyone that hasn't been here before, you will probably have to wait in line. In the 3 years that I've been coming here I've only been seated without waiting in line once and that was when I came on a Tuesday in the middle of the summer before the dinner rush. The longest I've waited was 2 hours and it was still totally worth it! If you're not down for a wait, you can just call ahead and get your food to go or even make a to go order in person if you get there and decide the line is too long.The most recommended dish has to be the burnt ends, but they run out quickly. They make burnt ends twice a day (at 11:00 am and 5:00 pm, I think). I would also highly recommend the ribs and rib tips. I generally get the brisket and chicken as well, but I wouldn't say those are the most amazing dishes. They've got plenty of BBQ sauces to choose from as well. I've recently been getting the mustard, which is delicious with everything I've tried it with (brisket, chicken, ribs, rib tips, burnt ends).If you're in the area and you want great BBQ this is the only place to go.

<Content> Fear not, Black Dog totally lives up to the hype. I WISH there was a barbecue place in Chicago that even compared. I'm not one for moderation, so whenever I'm here I have to get everything that I really like. Which is a lot: Chicken wings, pulled pork, hot Georgia peach sauce, twice baked potato casserole, sweet potato fries, beans, and cornbread. I also like to get a flight of all of the sauces because even though the hot Georgia peach is pretty much one of the best things I have ever eaten, I like to dip my hunks of pork in all of the different flavors. Oh, and they have an awesome selection of craft beers and cocktails. One time I came here and ate so much that I couldn't eat anything else for 24 hours.

My menu favorite is the Carolina Burger with cheddar (pulled pork on a locally sourced beef hamburger and Carolina red sauce- which is the best bbq sauce i've ever had, with the perfect amount of spice and flavor and not sickly sweet). Everything is good here though honestly you can't go wrong.

<Content> I have been wanting to try the Black Dog for some time and finally had the chance after a day of golf. Arrived at 4:45 and thought we would get right in. Wrong, waited about 10 minutes. This is a good sign with that many people there at this time of day during the week. Waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and provided great service. It only got better from there. Ordered the three meat combo of burnt ends, brisket and ribs. I have to say the burnt ends were my favorite, but they all were perfectly cooked and the taste was outstanding. I went with the Carolina Red sauce and it had just enough zip in it. I was pleasantly surprised with their choice of beers and IPA's. I went with a tough to find Dog Fish Head Brown Ale on tap. I will be back Black Dog very soon. Nice work!

<Content> Wait time on a Saturday evening is long, signed onto the board and waited almost 1 hour for dinner. The place is rather small and service is okay. They were out of a few items including the beef brisket which I wanted to try. Ordered the combo platter, which I was expensive ($19) considering the normal-to-small portion size. The pulled pork, ribs, burnt ends, tasted good but wasn't exceptional. The different sauces were sweet and spicy ($2 for sauce platter). Carry out would be a better choice if you don't want to wait for a table. Overall, it was good.

<Content> Finally got a chance to try out Black Dog after receiving so many recommendations, and it didn't disappoint. One of the best places to eat in Chambana. I got the pulled pork and brisket. Both had great flavor and were very tender. The brisket was some of the best I've ever had. But the real stars were the sides. The cornbread is great and had pieces of pulled pork in it. Their twice baked potato casserole was easily my favorite part of the meal.I recommend getting there early as they were very busy and they sold out of Burnt Ends quickly (going to have to go back and to try them. Overall a great, authentic BBQ place that does it right.

<Content> This is one of the only good places to eat in Urbana-champagne. If I am being honest, I don't really "know" BBQ or smoked meat...but I know what I like. And this place was good. I had a party of 8, which had to be split, so we had almost everything on the menu. It was all really good. Each of us had a different BBQ sauce. I am not to into really spicy fairs, so I had the Georgia Peach on the meatloaf. It was really good. The reason I gave only 4 stars is because the sweet tea was terrible. It was warm. I know it seems picky, but I was really thirsty!

The burnt ends were cooked so well that it literally crumbled. Loved it. Potato salad was standard. Corn bread was a little different in what it was made from but okay. All came out to around $15. Definitely a place to try if you want some good Texas smoked BBQ!

I got the beef brisket with the Carolina sauce and sweet potato fries, I liked mine. The fries were the best sweet potato fries ever. Rest of family had pulled pork and they said it was dry. They were out of their homemade hot sauce and awkwardly brought two pretty much empty bottles to the table saying they needed to make more.

<Content> Wow. I was raised on Kansas City BBQ and have lived down south in two different states. I moved to CU skeptical of Illinois barbecue. (I lived in Michigan for awhile, and what they serve is the most heinous excuse for BBQ I've come across. Obviously Illinois ain't BBQ stupid like that state north and east of us on the other side of Lake Michigan.)Damn, has Black Dog has got it going on! We're talkin the real deal KC style burnt ends. The pulled pork is the meatier Georgia style, and better than any I ever had in Tennessee. The mustard based sauce was authentically Carolina. I swear, the Carolina Red was the best sauce I've had outside of Kansas City. The sauce is actually reminiscent of Gates (Hi! May I help you?!) in Kansas City more than any other sauce I've ever had. The pit beans were real pit beans. (Never got anything comparable in Tennessee.) And the burnt ends were moist, smokey, and delicious. Southern transplants, you best git yo asses down there quick, y'all. Hell, all y'all need to git yo asses down there quick, so long as you save me a spot in line. I guarantee you'll slap your momma and ask her why she can't cook like that! Can I give six stars, cause damn, they're worth it! And I haven't even mentioned the draught beer selection!

The burnt ends were good but a pretty small app. The collard greens and sweet potato fries were my favorite sides. The applesauce and meatloaf special were overrated for me but my brother loved it! Order to go if you want to have a slightly less exhausting wait.

Gets kinda noisy, but it is still tolerable.Overall this casual place is number one in my book.

<Content> I've had Black Dog three ways -- as an in-house meal, as carry-out eaten right nearby (so no heat was lost), and at a catered event at the South Research Park.The meat is really, really good. Tender with a deep-smoke, slow-cook flavor -- the pork is excellent (especially on the bone), the chicken is good. The quality is consistent -- good every time. I keep hearing about the amazing burnt ends, but I have not yet lucked into finding them available. They run out early and frequently.The sauces are average to below average. Sorry -- Porgy's (another local bbq joint) has much more robust and flavorful sauce (Texas style). I'm not just talking about one sauce -- I've had several (including the Georgia Peach, which a friend recommended). The sauces tend to be light on flavor and thin on substance. The sides are anywhere from excellent to okay. My favorite is the twice-baked potato casserole. Amazingly rich and delicious. A friend had the Southwestern potato salad and also loved it, except he said it was room temp rather than cold or warm. The sweet potato fries are good, but not great (they could use a dusting of curry powder or something). The pit beans have a nice meat flavor (bacon added) but also suffer from the same thin base, weak seasoning, and lack of complexity as the sauces. The coleslaw is bad. The cabbage is thick cut and bitter, the vinegar dressing nearly flavorless. I'm not a fan of NC bbq, and this reminds me of a bad side in NC (where I lived for a year).The stuffed cornbread appetizer is very good -- a wedge of dense and flavorful not-too-sweet skillet bread with some meat and extras worked in. But it too should be served warm and with butter, rather than slightly cool from the fridge.In all, if you are a meat lover willing to doctor or add your own sauce, Black Dog offers superior entre fair. The sides are kind of hit or miss -- choose what others recommend.The restaurant is in a very small space, so go early, expect to wait, or even accept getting turned away (happened to us once). Other people have told me the bar is good, but I don't drink and couldn't sit through the noise if I did. The place is usually packed and extremely loud. Just standing at the counter waiting to pay, I felt like my head was being banged on a gong. I also had to navigate a small, packed entryway going both in and out -- that may not seem like much, but it's tough on us quiet types. The good news is Black Dog offers a full carryout menu and accepts all credit cards except American Express. They do a good job of packing up the food to go, too.

I was wrong.The wait was probably 30 minutes, but the beer selection and the ability to get the beers in different sizes made the wait a non-factor.Sat at the bar and the prices were more than reasonable with very laid back friendly service. Not the world's best BBQ, but very good. The atmosphere learns a lot to the senses and I enjoyed the meal. The smoked sweet potato was a perfect side dish. Rib tips were not the meatiest tips I've had, but very good. Wife had the brisket and was impressed. Not too moist, not too dry, the way she likes it.Serving size isn't huge, but enough to fill the belly after some beers. Definitly a worth while visit.Great staff, service, atmosphere, beer, and food. What else could I ask for, I guess I paid the cheap Urbana parking meter, but I'm sure there is a free lot and I think the parking is free after hours.

<Content> Since I got to Champaign, I have been recommended by several of my friends to try this place. I had an opportunity to try the pulled pork sandwich with my choice in egg salad and sweet potato fries. The food tasted fantastic. The pork was seasoned quite well and glazed quite nicely. It is no wonder there is often a waiting line in order to be seated. The service was also excellent despite being packed. I highly recommend this place if you are visiting Champaign and are looking for a bite.

<Content> I love the BBQ here! I'm always worried that places with lots of sauces and sandwiches aren't conscious about my gluten free needs but I eat here regularly and haven't had any problems. The fries are NOT safe for fellow Celiacs, and neither is the corn bread (which I hear is fabulous). I do always make sure to tell them that I have a "gluten allergy" and require special attention. All of the sauces are gluten free as are all of the meats! People don't really rave about the ribs because they are dry rubbed and not fall off the bone but they are yummy. The brisket and pulled pork are my go-to favs. The burnt ends, when you can get them, are delicious but people either really love them or really dislike them. As for sides, the pit beans, apple sauce and potato casserole are all great compliments to their BBQ. They offer GF beer along with some delicious mixed drinks too!The wait at the restaurant is generally pretty long (especially during peak times) but you can call in and take out which is generally what we do. Definitely one of my local favorites!

<Content> This is it, the premier place for food in C-U. If you don't visit it while in town and care about what you eat you definitely missed out. A constantly changing draft list and new specials every day give you options other than the 5 star BBQ. The only thing to be warned about is because of the size you will have to wait, i'd go at odd times. Georgia Peach sauce on everything.

<Content> Really good food. Some of the best in Urbana. Long waits but I'm fortunate enough to work virtually across the street and therefore just get take-out.The best time to go is around 3pm or after 9pm. Those are the times it's typically quieter. Otherwise take-out is highly recommended.

I'm there with my roommate every Thursday evening because of the special side of mac and cheese, its seriously the best mac and cheese ever! Pulled Pork Sandwich is amazing as well as the Cuban Sandwich! You have to try the Smoked Artichoke dip on Tuesday evenings as well. You have to wait sometimes about an hour to be seated but its so worth it!

Second visit presented the same dilemma but this time i had plenty of time and it was well worth the wait. The cornbread is a meal in itself and pretty amazing!! Relaxed place to go, I sat at the bar and it was fun watching the action in the kitchen. Service was fabulous and they were patient with all my questions. Will definitely return and will be sure I have time to wait!!

<Content> Horrible service. I payed for a drink and the person who took the order just forgot about it and served several other people and I had to ask another worker to get my drink. Waited 14 teams before it was my party's turn to get seated but didn't get served because one of the member of the party ordered food for togo. I explained each members were intending to order food and will not eat the togo food while in the restaurant. However, we were not served and left after receiving the togo items the one member ordered. Regret leaving tip for the drink.

<Content> This place is absolutely outstanding. My friends and I come here all the time, usually about twice a week, with an obligatory visit to their late-night. Every single item I've had was delicious. From burnt ends, to beef ribs, pork ribs, pastrami sandwiches, smoked duck, fried chicken, brisket, and a stupid number of late night home made sausages among other things, every single entree is a new and delicious adventure. The meat is smoked to perfection, the dry rubs are all world class, and you get your choice of BBQ sauce to suit your taste. The cornbread even has pulled pork baked into it. The sides are all good, but the best are definitely the sweet potato fries. I did not expect to find food this good in Urbana-Champaign, but here it is. This place is a real hidden gem.But this place doesn't stop at the food. The beer selection is great, with an awesome bottled selection (not huge, but it's quality), and a constantly changing set of beers on tap. Add to this their whiskey selection and cocktails (pineapple pepper tequila margarita...) , and this place is a fantastic bar on top of being a top-notch restaurant.Oh, and did I mention the price is beyond reasonable? 5/5 this place is worth a visit. Or two. Or twenty.

<Content> Can't go wrong with most anything on the menu - yeah, even the falafel and smoked polish (I suggest Milo's mustard sauce) are great. Not a huge fan of the portobello sandwich nor the ribs. The staff is great. Beer selection is regularly changing, not that I drink beer that often but its fun to go in a get the dog bone flight to try new things. The late night menu is also awesome. They make, in house some of them, different kinds of hot dogs and other tasty crazy tid bits that may only hang around for a week or so. One of my faves was a smoked tomato soup where they smoked all the ingredients, it was meatless and awesome!They also host special dinner throughout the year. I've attended a few and never been disappointed.

Some of the best pork and brisket I have ever had, and their sauces are all really different and delicious. Seriously, you need to try it!Tip: getting it carry out is super quick.

<Content> We were originally going to go to Golden Harbor, but they are closed on Monday nights. So we decided to call Black Dog to see how long the wait is, when we heard it was only 10-15 mins wait, we wasted no time. We put our name down and still had to wait like 20-30 mins. We had 6 people so it was harder. They eventually squeezed the 6 of us in a booth. Burnt ends was amazing! It was so perfect. mmm! Ribs was also delicious. The meat came off the bone perfectly. Twice baked potato casserole tasted more like mashed potato. I didn't think it was very special. Beans were surprisingly good! I usually hate all types of beans, but I found myself trying more than 1 bite of my friend's dish. The only thing that I was MEH about was the sauce. I thought Georgia Peach was a bit too sweet, but the meat is already seasoned, so I didn't even eat it with the sauce.We saw the owner working and he even talked to us about the food. He's such a chill guy and I can tell that he loves his job.

<Content> FINALLY returned and tried that burnt ends sandwich all the young people are talking about! I loved it, and I'm not even a brisket person. Very tender with just the right amount of crunch! It was actually kind of miraculous that they hadn't run out, since I ordered them at 6:30 on a busy Friday night! Fortune was smiling upon me, I guess.Our table also split the cornbread as an appetizer, which was just a little bit spicy (and meaty, of course). Will other restaurants please jump on the savory cornbread train? I am straight-up tired of eating over-sweetened cornbread that tastes more like cake. Ugh. My boyfriend and I split a beer flight, which is a fantastic deal: you are getting essentially 24 oz of beer for just $6. And the little glasses all came out on a large wooden plate shaped like a dog bone! Too adorable.The one not-so-good thing about our meal was the corn on the cob - it was mushy and flavorless and got stuck in our teeth! I know this is a little early for corn season, but shit, we ARE in the middle of Illinois - you'd think they could get corn right! Just stick with another side dish and you'll be fine.

Then once we were seated we ordered drinks, which came quickly (I suggest the Ace Perry Ale!) and wings as an appetizer with smoked Bleu cheese, which was SO GOOD. Wr all 3 got the Burnt Ends and other assorted meat. It was definitely awesome food, best chicken wings any of us have had, and the experience as a whole was GREAT! We will def be back!!!!

<Content> After calling around to all the BBQ places in town, we decided to go with Black Dog for a catering event for 200-300 people. We got 20 lb. pulled pork, 20 lb. pulled chicken, buns, sauce, potato salad and cole slaw. They were absolutely fantastic to work with (for instance, offering pulled chicken even though that's not on their catering menu) and the price was the best around (compared to Famous Dave's, Blues, Lil Porgy's, and Hickory River). The food was such a hit with the crowd that those of us working the event didn't get a chance to eat much of it, so we went back to Black Dog afterwards and got dinner! The potato casserole is divine, the potato salad is spicy and delicious, and the meat is just phenomenal. I've tried the Carolina Red and the Chipotle sauce, both of which were delicious.The restaurant itself is tiny and was packed on a Friday night, so while turnover is pretty fast, expect to wait 10-20 minutes if you come at a busy time. The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and food comes out pretty fast, so no complaints there. Prices are pretty standard--about $7 for sandwich and a side, $10-12 for a platter with 1-2 meats and 2 sides. Definitely worth trying!

<Content> Black Dog is pretty tasty, although in my experience, they're still working otu the kinks, so you'll have to deal with their occasional running out of food you might like.Still, the drink selection is nice, and good God, the pulled pork was tasty. The pit beans were phenomenal. Personally, I'd recommend getting the coleslaw on the side--and then not eating it. That wasn't so good, but everything else was.And sweet Mary and Joseph--CORNBREAD WITH MEAT IN IT.Yes. UH. MAY. ZING.The wait staff is friendly and personable, and the food is top notch. My only other complaint would be the lack of fried catfish 6 out of 7 days. Oh, they have regular catfish, but it's only fried on Fridays. And that just breaks my heart. Because I LOVE fried catfishy. DOn't judge me.Tasty, tasty catfish. Anyhow, Black Dog is worth a stop, they've definitely renovated and improved the former space, and the food is great.

<Content> This place is amazing on about 15 different levels. You literally can order anything on the menu, and it will be amazing. Obligatory praise due for the burnt ends (smokier, juicier cap of the brisket, with a crispy, burnt edge), pulled pork, and brisket. Of course, that's leaving out any one of the awesome burgers, the half chicken,ribs, and their awesome sides (pit beans or sweet potato fries for me...but regular fries, southwestern potato salad, twice baked casserole, and smoked sweet potato w/ brown sugar and butter...all ridiculously awesome).The red cabbage cole slaw, and any number of their homemade sauces (my favorite being the hot georgia peach) are outstanding compliments to the meat. and they're conscientious too. a few small price hikes to support grass fed, local beef, and the delightful free-range chicken. they even recycle, which I assure you most of the restaurants in town do not. Oh, and don't glaze over when you hear the specials. Burritos for lunch are insane, and don't get me started on the beef ribs. Slightly more labor intensive than the pork ribs (at risk of being redundant, also excellent), but a serious treat. Almost forgot to mention their amazing beverage selection. Not only is their beer selection fantastic (with the option for an affordable flight of craft beers), they have 1) an awesome whiskey selection 2) awesome bottled soft drinks...mexican coke and squirt (with sugar, not corn syrup), and a couple other tasty options. Alright, this post is getting annoyingly long. But this place is just too good. They deliver you an amazing product while being environmentally conscientious, and just overall nice guys. Lastly, I also might clarify a couple things that people have commented on, but are inaccurate.The platter vs. the sandwichplatter is twice the meat of a sandwich (in the case of brisket, pork, or ends), with two sides, and no bun. so it's not "basically the same thing," it's twice as much of everything, without a bun.the beans don't come out of a microwave, they are smoked and then kept in a hotbox, which is very much not a microwave. plastic might still melt, but it didn't happen in a microwave.That is all.

<Content> I think your experience of the Black Dog's atmosphere is largely contingent upon what sorts of restaurants you've been to in the past and how you expect to be treated by the people who are serving you/cooking you food for the evening. If you tend to go out to restaurants like, say, Chili's or Friday's, where the servers are obligated to be saccharine to the point of nausea, then hey! you probably won't like The Black Dog's atmosphere because you'll think the servers, host or bartenders are rude for not falling all over themselves to do your bidding. I personally love the Black Dog, primarily for the food. If I had one complaint about the place it would be that it gets pretty cramped. Probably once a week I entertain the notion of going to eat here and have to decide against it because of how ridiculously busy it is. I know The Black Dog isn't hurting for business and I might even be doing them a favor by not going to dine with them on their busier evenings, but GOD, I love them so much. Why do you constantly rebuff my advances, Black Dog?The Black Dog is hands down one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I've loved everything I've tried on the menu thus far. The portions are always more than enough, and the food is, frankly, under-priced for the amount and quality of food you get. The first time I went I expected to pay $15 an entree and was shocked to find it was far cheaper. Pay this place a visit, even if you have to wait 40 minutes to be seated. Worth it.

<Content> Okay, I've been to Black Dog twice so far. I was really excited before the first visit because of all the great reviews on Yelp, and I ended up being sadly disappointed in my dry beef brisket sandwich and slightly metallic-tasting pit beans (although being that I don't often come across foods that taste of metal, I wrote it off as a problem with my mouth that evening). This experience really struck me deeply...I'd never had an eating experience that contradicted so sharply with a Yelp consensus. Was something wrong with me? I began to feel quite gastronomically insecure.I gave it a second try recently, opting for a plate of rib tips along with an order of potato salad and corn on the cob. Again, a sunken heart. About half of the rib tips were great, while the other half were terribly dry and tough; I had to force myself to finish them. As for the sides, the corn on the cob was mushy and bland, but the spicy potato salad was pretty enjoyable. We threw a sampler beer flight into the mix, which was probably the best part of the meal (and a good value to boot, being that you net out at more beer for less money than most of the single glasses). I'm sorry to say that Black Dog is oh-for-two. Maybe I just had bad luck in picking the worst items on the menu or coming in on bad days, but now that I'm no longer living in the area (this was my last dinner in Chambana), it unfortunately may never have an opportunity to redeem itself again with me. Au revoir, dawg.

<Content> Yea, I feel dumb writing the 99th review... as if what I say about Black Dog will be more relevant or informative than the 98 before me... but might I say anyway:I live in Los Angeles, I'm here for the summer. Not that LA is known for bbq, but neither is East Central Illinois, so I'll continue. STILL, I eat at a barbecue/beer joint every week, more than once a week in Los Angeles and BLACK DOG makes me feel embarrassed that I spend $20 on a pulled pork sandwich, a beer and a tip at Blues BBQ in West Hollywood. 6.95 for a burnt tips or ends or whatever sandwich AND a side [I had potato salad and dipped those spuds into every one of my sauce flight sauces].  And like $4 for a glass of what our AWESOME, nice-sporty-but-down-to-earth-witty waiter  waiter called a REALLY nice PBR. I got there at 11:00 and watched the place fill up to the point where we had to use a back exit to get a baby in a stroller and a 4-year-old out of the restaurant. But they HAD A BACK DOOR and they let us use it which made us feel cool and made them look cool for being accommodating. It probably wasn't even a secret door, but we felt grateful all the same. The vegetarian 4-year-old happily ate an awesome looking provolone grilled sandwich, so Imma just put that out there in case your vegetarian self gets pulled along to Black Dog. Nice-sporty-but-down-to-earth-witty waiter sampled us beer, gave me an extra sauce when I decided which one from my flight was the best [I liked Georgia Peach] and was really attentive despite a full-house at 11:30 a.m. I got out of there full-to-the-brim and more satisfied than I've been in awhile [good bbq paired with beer is a wonderful lover] for less than $12 [excluding the big ol' tip he deserved]. Why is CU so great?? If someone wanted the short version of what my BBQ at Black Dog experience was, I would yell: "LEGIT AS HELL." and hope that summed up the flava', waiter and atmosphere.

<Content> The best BBQ this side of the Mississippi... I'm not kidding, this stuff is amazing!Black Dog uses local farms in the majority of their meal production, and it definitely shows! The food is fresh, reasonably priced, and finger lickin good, and comes complete with wet naps.Would have received 5 stars if not for the service... From start to finish, it's lackluster, at best. The gentleman host seems checked out and by your presence, and the hipster staff follows suit. At times, you feel as though you have to apologize for requiring them to do their job. Not to mention that they're trying to push you out the door the minute you receive your entree. There are some exceptions to this (funny, tall hippy guy with great sense of humor, awesome short-haired lady cook, bald, heavily bearded bartender), but the more than few bad apples leave an unfortunate bad taste in your mouth.If you can get past the service and long waits, this place is amazing!

<Content> Meh, I've experienced better. Certainly not a place I'd go for a relaxing dining experience. Went on a Thursday night, and was ushered in to two seats at the end of the bar by the hostess. The bartender/server was nice and was around enough to take our order, and the service was very efficient, almost too efficient. I certainly felt rushed to order, eat my food, pay my bill, and leave so the people waiting could eat. I've been to much busier BBQ places like Oklahoma Joes in Kansas City that operates a similar size joint out of a gas station and it's all self seating, and although most people won't sit there all day while others wait, they don't hurry you out after you've waiting your turn in line. I probably still had half my food on my plate when I was asked "are you all done with that?"... seriously? As for the food, I ordered the cornbread appetizer, and the pork inside was a interesting touch, which I liked. Before we could finish our cornbread the food was already served. I got the pulled pork/brisket combo with twice baked casserole and slaw. The sides were pretty good, though my GF's potato salad had zero flavor. The meat was nothing special. Yes, it was tender, but the pulled pork almost looked roasted rather than smoked, and having an ice cream scoop shaped pork was kinda odd. The house sauce was what really killed it for me. I really couldn't put my finger on what I don't like about it but the sweet, smoky, kick it has just doesn't do anything for me but overpower the flavor of the meat. And like everyone else says, the place is packed and cramped all the time. If this place is so great then they should give the customer a good overall dining experience and not just rely on their food. I'll try going back again sometime, and who knows I may hit the lottery and be able to get their seemingly impossible to get burnt ends.

<Content> Um, I'm not quite sure how I haven't reviewed this place yet. I'm a BBQ junkie. I've had it all over the country, from the dry rub of Memphis to the vinegar based sauces of North Carolina to the beef ribs of Texas. I'm not an expert, but I do know what tastes good.Black Dog tastes good.I've had the burnt tips (in my opinion, the burnt ends of food are always the best) and the brisket, and both were succulent. A huge plus for me is that the food doesn't come drenched in sauce. That way you can actually taste the meat and the rub and get a true feel for the barbecue. I love the baked beans, mainly because they have little pieces of pork in them. The fries are nice and crispy, which I love. After coming from a hard workout, I was able to demolish the combo platter with a slightly too full feeling, so it's a lot of food. Normally I can't eat that much. I still haven't bought ribs, so that's the next thing to try.Because of the hype around this place, the service is not always the best. It's small and a bit cramped as well. This is why it only gets 4 stars. I wonder if they'll have a patio this summer, because honestly I can think of nothing better than a plate of barbecue, warm weather, and cold beer.

<Content> I took some out of town family members here for lunch this past Sunday. It was crowded, yes. A lot of people look at the line and immediately turn around. Keep in mind, there isn't a lot of room to stand indoors and wait for tables. It's a pretty small place, but the wait is WORTH it!We started with the burnt ends. If you don't go early, you won't get them. They run out quickly (there's only so many of them since they come off the brisket). They melt in your mouth. They are ridiculously delicious. We also split the smoked wings. The sauce they put on them seems to be a spiced up version of their Carolina Red sauce. They were awesome.For entrees we had quite a mix. The salmon was great. I even tried the beet salad with goat cheese. Not a normal menu item. I should say that I can't stand beets normally. These were good and I kept sneaking bites of my husband's! The brisket was perfect as was the smoked Polish. My dad loved his catfish, too. What really made the meal was our server Matthis (spelling? Sorry if it's wrong). He was funny, friendly and fast. Our drinks were never empty and he seemed to really care that we were happy. I wish it wasn't always so busy. I guess it's because the food is so delicious. Like I said though, it's worth the wait. Thanks to everyone there for a great lunch!

He told me that he thought the waitress was going to sit some people where I was sitting and told me to come down to the area where orders are picked up. First problem, I am a paying customer and it was busy. Second problem, it's a bunch of crap to direct a paying customer to stand for 15+ minutes. Third problem, I like the food but I don't love it and I can certainly go without the unneeded crap from the bartender not to mention the attitude from a waitress that we are the best. Even if a restaurant is the best being condescending and arrogant will keep me from coming back!!!!

<Content> I'm a long-time lurker, first-time writer.We went to Black Dog last night at 8:00pm after hearing rave reviews on two local blogs (you probably can guess which ones.)Well, we stood by the door for a good 5 to 7 minutes politely waiting with absolutely no one giving us a blink of attention. We saw people in booths and tables with food and drinks, waited on by a woman, and at least two people standing around behind the bar. They were not busy.Finally tiring of this exercise we seated ourselves at the bar uninvited. The bartender came by and told us they were basically out of food. No ribs, no pulled pork, no chicken, nothing.I can understand their under-estimating demand given that they haven't been open that long. (Although, if you start serving ribs at 5pm, you only have something like 5 booths and 4 tables, and you're out by 8pm -- huh?)But if someone had told us there were out when we came in, it wouldn't be a problem. Letting customers just stand around stupidly is ridiculous. I'm sorry, no food is so good to suffer so much attitude. I felt like I was in a snooty restaurant in Paris.No thanks. We went down the street to Seven Saints and had a nice dinner with friendly service.

<Content> I often frequent Black Dog for lunches away from work. They can get really busy and have very little seating, which is off-putting for some, but I don't mind it. I LOVE the cornbread with chilis and pulled pork in it, but it's not for everyone. Their BBQ sauces are awesome! I could eat a shoe if it was dipped in some Hot Georgia Peach. Their smoked turkey is amazing - which surprised me because I hate turkey but had to try it when I was drooling over someone else's meal. I've tried most proteins on the menu and sandwiches - I've never been let down. Only once have a thought the meat was a little skimpy, but it's not like I left hungry. I've been very happy with the service every time I've come as well. Everybody I've encountered has been friendly and that only adds to the dining experience.

<Content> Hands down the best restaurant in Champaign. Really. Every regular menu item is fantastic (the pork, the brisket, the polish, catfish, etc. etc. etc.) The bbq sauces are amazing as well. Personally I like the chipotle, its spicy and amazing. The carolina red is great as well with a nice kick, and the hot georgia peach is an awesome combo of sweet and spicy. If it were just for this it would already be 5 stars. But it isn't just this.The specials might be even better than the regular bbq. The cuban is the best cuban I've ever had. The pastrami is the best pastrami I've ever had. The new turkey club (twice a week) is THE BEST turkey sandwich I've ever had. The fried cod on Friday might be the best sandwich all week.  Finally, the tacos and burritos here can stand up to Maize any day.And then there's the beer. Different craft beers every time you go in there. Place is just awesome.

<Content> Can't rave enough about how good the food is here. Tried the smoked polish for a change and DAMN! perfection; had no idea a sausage could be so tasty.The quality and variety on the ever-changing beer sampler flight holds me in thrall to the awesomeness that is Black Dog. They continue to seem busier every time we return. Still run out of stuff- once again scored one of the last burnt ends portions.And, yes, I actually eat here way more often than I yelp it. I know, right? If I could only eat one place in Urbanabannana for the rest of my time here- it'd probly be here.A tiny blond sorority type was asking about vegetarian options. Umm, sorry sweetie, have your boyfriend run you up-street to Courier. The waitress was all "well, our fries are vegetarian, and we could fix you a grilled cheese." Mwahahaha.

<Content> I'm learning that it's unfair to compare BBQ joints to Smoque and Lem's. That being said Black Dog is on par with County Line BBQ. I tried a little bit of everything. Only the cornbread & the smoked wings stood out as exceptional. Wings were cooked perfectly tender and had a nice spice rub. The ribs were just ok. Fairly tender, but didn't live up to the hype. The brisket was terrible. Dry, bland definitely not tender. Pulled pork was also dry and flavorless. I'll probably stop by again, but only for the wings.

<Content> Who would have thought that Champaign, Illinois can put out the best barbecue? You lucky UIUC kids, I'm jealous!Last September, I went to Black Dog for the first time on a double date. We had a 40-minute wait but time flew by in their awesome draft beer selection. They ran out of the famous burnt ends (meat cut from the point half of a smoked brisket) by the time we sat down, but everything else was delicious so I promised myself to go back. And I did, 3 times! It has become a tradition for my boyfriend and me. The quality of their food and beer is amazingly consistent.The burnt ends turned out to be perfectly charred, moist and smokey. On top of that, their hot polish and chicken are just mind blowing. I never pick chicken over beef/pork at bbq places, until I reached my fork into my friend's Black Dog chicken platter :P But tonight, we got another surprise...Smoke Duck Special, which has now made Thursday night the best night! Both the duck and the chicken are worth trying. They not too greasy and deliciously spiced.Last but not least, I have fallen in love with their sides and bbq sauces. You can't go wrong with the sweet potato fries and the vinegar based slaw, also, the cornbread has BRISKET in it! I know the bbq sauce variety does not help your decision making. If you like something with a little "zing" or "kick", I suggest the Hot Georgia Peach and the mustard.

<Content> Plenty of positive detailed reviews here already. First timer. Stopped by on way back from Danville Il for dinner Fri around 5:45p. Seemed like a good time to get a table. Last time we tried the wait at Lunch was ridiculous. The ribs were outstanding and tons of interesting sauces to choose from. Recommend the flight of sauces for $2. Enough for the whole table. The corn bread is simply the best I have ever had. So dense. Yum. Oh and the Bloody Mary made with tequila and the Pineapple margarita were awesome. Wish this place was closer!

<Content> Mmmmmm. I'm insanely thankful for this place, because now when my parents come to town, my brother can suggest a BBQ place that isn't Famous Dave's. Burnt ends = heaven on a sandwich. I got the cole slaw and sauce on the side so I could enjoy the smoky meat on its own with the occasional dip into the bbq sauce... The fries were nothing special, but also good dipped in bbq. The place is a little small and cramped, but that's part of the charm, and you just know a place is going to be good when you walk into a packed restaurant.Minus one star because we sat at our table for 5-10 minutes before a waitress came by and said "Oh, did you need menus?"

<Content> Love this place! Great food -- always busy (get there right at 11 or after 1, then right at 5 but after 7 to avoid the lunch/dinner rush -- otherwise you'll be standing in a long line) BUT I have a few issues:1. It's kid friendly only if your kid can sit by himself in a chair.  There are no high chairs in this place -- probably because the tables and booths are fairly high (booths are on risers, tables are tall bar tables) so you either have to tag team with another person in your party to hold your kid while the other eats OR bring your own portable high chair that attaches to one of the booths OR hire a babysitter and have a parents' night out.2. Prices.  Prices are fairly reasonable considering all the food is local, but some of the specials seem a little bit over-priced.  I mean, Monday's they have a Chicago style hot dog.... $6.95 for a hot dog seems pretty steep. As well as the beef stroganoff....we ordered a takeout order of this and it came in one of those small takeout soup containers. It rang in to around $11.95 if I'm not mistaken.... YIKES.  I would stick with the sandwiches for $6.95 with one side. A platter is $11.95 -- basically the same thing (minus the bun) + two sides.  The price jump from a sandwich to a platter doesn't seem worth it to me.Those are my two issues. We eat here at least once a week and I LOVE the pulled pork sandwich, the Cuban sandwich, and the burnt end sandwich (although the last couple times I had it, it was dry). My side of choice is either the potato salad (to die for!) or a side salad (all local,fresh vegetables....so refreshing!!!).UPDATE: they now have highchairs! The kind that attach to the table. We actually bought a Phil and Ted portable high chair to specifically bring with us to BD, but they beat us to it.... So now i only have the one issue about their prices. BTW -- their smoked chicken is WONDERFUL as well as their pit beans.  If you're wondering what to feed your 10 month old baby, try little bits of chicken, pulled pork, the sweet potato and some beans!

<Content> I've been to Black Dog two times now, and have been pleasantly surprised both times. My coworkers had told me about this place and everyone had ranting about how amazing it was. Given that I love good barbecue, I knew I had to check it out, so when a buddy of mine got dumped by his fiancee, I knew exactly what he needed--beer and barbecue from Black Dog.The first time I went, I had a pulled-pork sandwich with fries and a beer. I had the standard red sauce, which was tangy and delicious. The pork was juicy and flavorful. The bun was large and tasty. They put coleslaw on their pulled pork sandwiches, which I probably would have asked them not to put on it had I known, but I decided to give it a shot since it came that way, and I was pleasantly surprised at how it added to the experience. The fries were good steak fries--fairly standard fare for such a place. It's hard to mess up fries.The second time I went was with a large group of people (~12), which given the size of the place, proved to be a bit of a chore. Part of the group had to sit in a booth, while the rest occupied the high tables.I ordered a full rack of ribs with potato salad and sweet potato fries on the side. Sweet potato fries are always great, but because of the sugar content seldom reach a decent level of crispiness. These were adequately crispy and very flavorful and had brown sugar on them, adding a nice touch. The potato salad had something spicy in it, which gave it a nice, unique kick. The ribs were fantastic, and having been there, I really wouldn't recommend anywhere else in town for ribs. They had clearly been cooked a long time and seemingly without boiling. The edges were crispy and flavorful and the insides were tender and juicy. I ordered the same sauce I had ordered the first time I visited, which once again, was tangy, sweet, and delicious.The atmosphere was good--pretty laid back, somewhat cozy and down-to-earth while still maintaining a sense of rustic class. The layout prevents the gathering of particularly large groups, which is not surprising for a place that size. It was worth splitting the group a bit to go there.

<Content> I've eaten at Black Dog a few times now and have tried a number of things off their menu. Among the choices, one of my favorites is the pulled pork sandwich with their signature sauce. The pork has plenty of smoky flavor but it is not overwhelming while the sauce has a slight tang and complements the meat well. I recently tried the pulled chicken sandwich and found it was just as good if not better than the pork. Outside of main entrees, the sweet potato fries are fantastic as is the corn bread. One thing to note about the sandwiches is that they all come with cole slaw on top unless you specifically ask otherwise.As others have noted, there is not a lot of seating in the restaurant and if you happen to visit during a busy time you may end up waiting for a while. Also, given the tight quarters, there isn't much standing room while waiting so things can get cramped rather quickly. If you want to try Black Dog's food without waiting for a seat, they do offer carry out which is extremely quick.

<Content> Best barbeque around. Meat is smoked perfectly! I also like that you get to choose what style bbq sauce to have. I'm not much of a Carolina vinegary sauce person, so I reallllly like the Georgia Peach sauce and the Texas sauce. Be sure to get there around 5- thats when their burnt ends and smoked sweet potatoes are ready. But don't get there too late or it'll be packed and they might run out of them. Which I guess is alright cause they have so much other good meat. Their pulled pork is amazing, and so is their brisket. The older guy who seats you sometimes is a mood killer though, that's all I'll say. Expect a wait- you can't call ahead or anything which is a bummer, but it's well worth the wait.

<Content> I've heard so much about how great Black Dog is, and finally got a chance to try it this past weekend. Having heard that the burnt ends sell out quickly, my friends and I got there at 5 (apparently the have a batch of burnt ends at 11 AM and 5 PM) to a minimal line, and got seated after about 10 minutes of waiting. As good as everything on the menu sounded, I knew I had to have the burnt ends, so I ordered a burnt ends sandwich.I took my first bite of my burnt ends sandwich and instantly the only things I could think were, "Oh my god this is amazing" and "What have I been doing the last four years of my life?". The burnt ends had a delicious smoke flavor which were complemented very well by the Carolina Red BBQ sauce, which has a slight bit of heat. I also enjoyed the soft cornmeal dusted bun that the meat came on. I found this sandwich to go really well with the draft Arrogant Bastard that I had. For my side I had the regular fries, which were good, but nothing extraordinary. The burnt ends were the true standout here. It's a shame I didn't come here before I ended up graduating, but I guess I avoided gaining 10 pounds from eating here all the time if I did.

<Content> I visited this place on a Saturday afternoon and a very hot summer day. It wasn't too busy, so we got seated quickly. However, it was sweltering in there. Their A/C just couldn't combat the heat from cooking, so we were literally sweating the entire time. It is also very cramped in there if you are at a table and not a booth. The server was quite rude---it was our first time there and we had to ask about the sauces. She seemed really put out by having to answer questions. She never smiled, seemed miserable, plunked down our food, and generally made us feel completely unwelcome. The food was good, but not remarkable. I know others on this site rave about it, but I was personally under-impressed. I have had my share of BBQ and enjoyed it just fine. However, the atmosphere and service ruined the experience for me. I suppose if you order take-out it would be better. Don't think I'll go back even for that, though.

<Content> Black Dog is probably one of my five favorite places in the country. I'm partial to the pulled pork and the twice baked for the side, but everything is good....if I'm feeling really saucy I'll get the Carolina Burger, which is a burger with pulled pork on it. That's right. I love they're constantly rotating beers, and offer flights for you to try. Yeah, it's always busy and the place is small. It's busy because it's the best.

<Content> I, like everyone else, have a hard time finding anything bad to say about this place.I almost always get the beef brisket and a beer, but their pulled pork, chicken, and polish are amazing, as well. One visit, they had pozole, which was pretty damn good. The sweet potato fries are a must, but every other side I've tried is amazing, too: pit beans, regular fries, baked potato casserole, and on and on.It's got a very casual vibe that I like, but it's also not so casual that it's trashy. There's often local abstract art on the walls, but there's also a huge jug of tequila and pineapple on top of the fridge. So, there's a desirable balance.Since this place now has a rep, lunch and dinner times are sometimes kind of crazy. If you can hit it around 3 p.m. during the week, you usually won't have to wait for a table.The prices are fair, as long as you don't go too nuts with the beer.

<Content> Darn it! Why there is nothing like this place in my town? I'm just jealous with UIUC kids. I got there, it was packed so my friends and I have to wait around 15-20 minutes, I'll accept that. Sat down and we ordered the famous burnt ends (TWICE!), sweet potato fries and ribs. Ordered the beers and as a moderate fan of beer, I'll have to say that they have the right beer in stock. Food came, I have to keep myself not to swallow the food because OMG everything was delicious! Especially the burnt ends, it just melts above your tongue and that is why we ordered it twice. Place is always packed but hey, the wait will always be worth it!

<Content> Finally was able to come back to try out their dinner menu. Got the Combo Platter, 1/3 slab of ribs and 1/2 a chicken and two sides for 10.95, can't be beat. (They only serve these after 5pm). The ribs were pretty tender with a nice smokey char on the outside and the chicken was soft, mostly cuz it was dark meat but it also had a distinct smoked flavor that reminded me of lil porgies. They don't give you enough sauce to cover both of them, but they'll give you more if you just ask.The red cabbage coleslaw was a little too sour for me, but boy...the sweet potatoe fries are pretty awesome, I couldn't get enough of them!! Sweet, crunchy, potatoey...with a little bit of that sauce...ooo...i'm drooling right now and it's morning.Now I can confidently say that it's one of the better places on campus for bbq and I'll be coming back for their full rack of ribs in the next week or two.

<Content> This might be the best barbecue that I have had in the Midwest. I'm straining my brain to think of better. I spent three years in Texas where I became a real lover of all things barbecue. Black Dog knocked my socks off.We started with chicken wings. They arrived too hot to touch and glazed in the house standard Carolina BBQ sauce. They were great. Then we shared two combination platters which included brisket, sausage, pulled pork, ribs, twice baked potatoes, slaw, pit beans and sweet potato fries. We had a flight of BBQ sauces which included Carolina, Texas Georgia peach hot and mild, chipotle, Milo's mustard and a vinegar. Get the flight. The diversity of the sauces is half the fun.Keep in mind that you are in a college town and the atmosphere is busy, bustling and full of college kids. I enjoyed it, and actually prefer it over a faux-texan theme with a bunch of cowboy junk on the walls.Great beer selection also. I'll be back next time I'm in Urbana.

<Content> What we ordered:Pulled Pork Sandwich w/ their house Carolina Style BBQ sauce w/ slaw on the sideBrisket Sandwich w/ house BBQ sauce w/ slaw on top (traditional way)Sides: Cornbread, Baked Beans, Spicy Potato SaladThe meat is tender and flavorful - I preferred the pork, my husband preferred the brisket. The sauce was very good- definitely homemade, not the HFCS stuff from the bottle. It's not as sweet as the thick and dark styles, but its delicious, with a bit of heat. The slaw is is vinegar, not mayo-based and mine was fresh and crisp. The cornbread was delicious- the description says it has chilies, beans, and meat in it, and I was imagining something with big chunks or almost like a baked sandwich- when it arrived it looked like a piece of thick cornbread, but when you bit into it the flavor was salty and smoky with just a hint of chile flavor- no discernible pieces of beans/meat. The potato salad was good, but not the best I've had. The baked beans were delicious, with a definite smokiness, NOT the sweet stuff you're used to from pot lucks or the can!Delicious BBQ!

<Content> I ordered the beef ribs, which were the special.And then I saw the Cuban sandwich go by and I thought, "oops, should have ordered that instead."And then I got my ribs and I thought, "No, I'm glad I got these."But I would for sure try the Cuban next time!This place was packed on a Wednesday night, with a steady stream of carryout orders going out the door. The only thing I didn't love was that the bar has sort of a wide lip on the edge that forces you to really lean into it to get your food. Not a huge deal, but a minor inconvenience.

<Content> Named after the owners' two dogs: Oscar and Lola...Black Dog has officially opened. Finally! A lip-smackin' smoke house with a more than decent beer menu...offering a cozy warm environment too!They offer VERY reasonably priced sandwiches for $6-$10: pulled pork, catfish, chicken, brisket, polish and more! They also buy wheels of goat cheese (specially made just for Black Dog) and blue cheese from the local Prairie Fruits Farm and smoke it. Damnit..this place is perfect. After 5 p.m., pork spare ribs are not only to die for, but very affordable, and need no sauce. Score a full slab for $15 to boot!

<Content> We arrived late, for this part of the world (around 9:00 pm), so they had run out of the "burnt ends." Carolyn ordered a portobella mushroom sandwich and reported that it was pretty good. I went straight for the 1/2 slab of ribs, fries and beans. Everything was lip smackin' good. The ribs were a tad overcooked, but with the hot peach BBQ sauce, they tasted rather good.The fries were among the best I've had. That good. I'd go back just to order fires.The service, at the bar, was very good and the atmosphere just what you'd expected. Recommended.

<Content> A lot of my reviews lately have been negative. Have I just become too picky? Are my standards too high?When I start wondering that, it's time to go to Black Dog. This place is amazing. I've been there many times, with many people. Virtually everyone has been impressed. The sauces are good, the meat is wonderful, and the specials are interesting. If you are a beer fan (I am) they consistently have interesting beer in a variety of styles. The taps rotate very frequently, so it's almost always a different set of choices when you go. They also get some limited release stuff, like cask-aged beers. It's awesome. I'm not as much a cocktail drinker, but they also have their own infused liquors and cocktails made with them. I think the sandwiches are the best deal, and they are consistently great. Tender pulled pork, the always-in-demand and frequently out of stock burnt ends, and delicious brisket. You can also get the meat on top of a burger for a decadent and delicious treat. And the sides are all good too! Potato salad with actual flavor instead of just mayonnaise! The best sweet potato fries I've ever had! The platters seem like you maybe get a bit less food per dollar, but they're still good. I still have to give the nod to Lil Porgies for ribs, overall, but Black Dog is king for sandwiches.Specials include things like smoked salmon, muffaleta sandwiches, and burritos or tacos. They've had a couple charity nights with homemade ramen. If you see one of these and you like ramen at all - go. This is the closest to real Japanese ramen I've had, with awesome barbecue twists like a hard boiled egg that's been smoked and is still, somehow, gooey in the middle. Absolutely wonderful.The downside? Black Dog is so good there's often a line. It's not a huge place. It wouldn't be good at all for a group of more than 6 people. And waits of 30 minutes or more are not uncommon. Don't be surprised by that - this isn't the place to go for a quick bite. (Though they do offer take-out.)  Overall? Black Dog is really, really good. It makes you feel good to eat here. If you like barbecue at all - especially Carolina style - you should go here. Yes, there will probably be a wait - because the secret's out.

<Content> My friend and I went here for dinner tonight-- we both had delicious beers-- the scotch ale for me, and the wheat for him. Both were great, the waitress was very nice and prompt, and the food was absolutely delicious. I had the pulled pork, and it melted in my mouth. Plus, sweet potato fries were only $.50 extra, compared to the $1.50 extra they are at crane alley. They have a great beer selection, and you can smell the place like a block away... the sweet, sweet smell of gluttony (and I'm sure most of the other 7 deadly sins)... and it's great.All in all, 2 sandwiches, 3 beers, 20% tip and all under $30? Good in my book!

<Content> NOM!This place has great food, hands down. I have been here on two occasions now and both times it has made my heart sing. The flavors are exquisite.You get to pick your own sauce, which is great, and they'll bring you a sample if you're not sure you're going to enjoy one but you think... well, maybe...Get the burnt ends. While everything I've tried has been good, the burnt ends are the best thing on the menu. What they did to that meat is... beautiful, artistic, completely wonderful, simultaneously sinful and heavenly. Go here. For sure.

<Content> The food is DIVINE and reasonably priced. However, their place is much too small for the business that they do. I had to wait over half an hour just for a seat at the bar, and I felt rushed to finish/leave due to the number of peeps waiting behind me, not exactly ideal dining conditions. I don't think that I'll be back on a Friday or Saturday, ever; go during the middle of the week.

<Content> Never had something I didn't like from here. Decent beer selection, great food, and cozy atmosphere. The service is great and you can tell by the lines you see outside on any given night that its the best BBQ in town. Get there early, before the burnt ends are gone!My suggestion: They have a bacon bleu (I think?) burger that goes great with the Georgia peach bbq sauce and sweet potato fries!

<Content> This place is awesome, I go crazy whenever I see NC-style barbecue (see hometown).Went here on friday with some friends, it was small and packed but we only had to wait by the door 5-10 min. Sat at the bar and got the beer menu, they have a fantastic selection of really good beer for cheaper prices than you'd find at any other bar. Then it was a choice between the ribs, half chicken, catfish, and pulled pork (pulled pork !!!). I had to get the ribs, which were dry rubbed, smoked, and came with the perfect vinegar-y sauce. The sides are just as delicious, one of my friends fell so in love with his baked beans that he's been talking about them for the past two days. Looks like they also do breakfast/brunch, that'll be next on my list to try.

<Content> Seriously the best BBQ in the area. I like the pulled pork best. I have also had the brisket, but it was a little too smoky for me. I didn't even think that was possible, but it was. Chips and salsa are spot on. You wouldn't think to order them at a BBQ place, but definitely do, they are well worth it.Hands down favorite thing at this place: cornbread! It comes out all warm and goey. It has pork and whole bunch of other stuff in it that make it extra special. The prices are unbeatable too. Dinner for two, I'd be shocked if you spent more than $30 total with drinks. I've heard the wait can be bad, but I was there on a Saturday night at 7pm and only waited maybe 10 minutes. It was so good though I would wait much longer!Highly recommended!

<Content> Such a hidden gem in Urbana for college students because every time I rave about this place to someone they were unfortunate to not have the black dog experience. First off, the BBQ sandwiches (I've tried them all) are all phenomenal! If you're a BBQ person there should be no reason for you to not try this place.As a first timer, definitely try to get there early to get the burnt ends! They only have limited amounts made and the burnt ends do run out very quickly. Also, pay the extra 50 cents and get the sweet potato fries, honestly it will be the only place around the area that serve them and it is definitely a fresh new taste compared to the typical fries! I don't like sweet potatoes but these fries were worth trying!My friends and I also got the wings as an appetizer once and I always order them now since they were so good! It comes with lots of meat & good flavor so get them to share so you have plenty of room for their entreePLEASE don't pass this place up! I've taken many friends here and they have never been disappointed!!!

<Content> The best BBQ in Champaign-Urbana, hands down. Everything on their menu is good (no, seriously). Try something different every time!My favorite dishes are the beef brisket or pulled pork. My favorite sides are the sweet potato fries, the smoked sweet potato, twice-baked potato casserol, or their slaw.Special menu items are their "Burnt Ends" which are available at 11am and 5pm every day. These sell out quickly, so get a spot in line at 10:30 or 4:30 if you ever want to try these.

<Content> THE GOOD: the cuisine is really great--entrees, appetizers, and drinks all are 4-5 star foods. I would recommend the the corn bread (it has bits of BBQ pork in it) to start, the chicken sandwich for an entree (its free range and you can tell the difference) and whatever beer is on the "nitro tap" (it makes the beer really creamy).THE BAD: customer service is very poor. in order to be seated all of your party must be present. I was hassled because 5 out of 6 of us where there. I understand if 1 person is holding a table down for 6 but 5/6? C'mon. Also, servers have been cold, short, and gruff with my tables. On the whole, the staff comes off very pretentious.HOW TO FIX: right now you are walk in, consider a reservation system; expand your seating area/kitchen to accommodate more customers; ask your staff to be friendly (not many of them smile, honestly!) and understanding (especially in situations like the ones I described); try and give off the vibe that you appreciate our town in which you have been so successful.STAY or GO: I wouldn't pick Black Dog for a meal but I would go if someone else wanted to.

<Content> Honestly, all I need to say is burnt ends.It's not something I've seen at other bbq places but they really should do it. Seriously, I want to just go in with $50 and be like, "Load me up on the burnt tips."Besides that, I had brisket which was good. I feel like a lot of the smoked brisket I've had before tends to be very tender, but to the point where it's just like shreddy beef sinews. I appreciated that, though this brisket was tender, it had some structural integrity. Twice baked potato casserole was killer and the sweet tea was cloyingly sweet (which is the only way to make sweet tea). I also had slaw, which I didn't love and the sauce was pretty vinegary. But those burnt ends. It was enough to make me look past the little things.I'll be back. You bet I will. And I'll be back for burnt ends (but other good stuff too.)

<Content> Best BBQ in town! Unfortunately, everyone knows it, so the wait can be pretty long (30-40 min) at peak hours. But you can get a drink to pass the time. My favorite is rib tips with Carolina Red sauce, but everything is great here. The beer selection is not huge, but it is always terrific, and they switch it up a lot. Service is friendly, and the food is usually ready quickly (since it's all smoked). I eat here at least once a week, and am not tired of it yet! Good thing, since I always take home leftovers.

<Content> Without a doubt, 5 stars. The beef brisket was fantastic (even better that you could order a lean cut), but the burnt ends is where it's at! Crispy on the outside, still juicy on the inside...I don't know how they do it, but they better not stop any time soon. How about the BBQ sauce you might ask? Fantastic! A little bit spicy, just the way I like it. And don't forget the sides! I don't think you could go wrong with any of them.Now on to the beer. Oh the beer! They rotate selections, and you know they're good when you have 3 of the 8 choices and each one is better than the last. Especially nice that you could take it outside while you're waiting.This is definitely my first stop for whenever I come to town from now on. A-mazing!

<Content> I absolutely love this place. It's the best bbq in Urbana-Champaign by far. I've never had something bad at Black Dog. The pulled pork, beef brisket, and burgers are all fantastic, and you can't really go wrong with any of the sides. Definitely get the cornbread - it's amazing and has pulled pork inside of it. The only downside is that it gets really crowded and there isn't much room to wait for a table, but it's definitely worth the wait. Oh, and if you plan on getting burnt ends, get there when it opens because they'll run out pretty quick.

<Content> Might as well toss my review on the pile of others, I guess. I had actually been avoiding Black Dog because of all the hype it's gotten on yelp, sorry to say. That was a definite mistake and I wish I had gone here sooner! Everything I've tried here has been excellent. Even the sweet potato fries, which I usually don't like, were awesome. The service was prompt and friendly. The prices are pretty darn amazing ($6 for a sandwich and side? Awesome). And they have fresh squeezed lemonade, free refills. My first time here was with my mom and stepdad, and they loved it. My stepdad hates pretty much every restaurant we go to, and his most frequently said phrase after dinner is "4/10." Black Dog got an "Eh, I'd come back here," which is a ringing endorsement from him.In addition they have a nice selection of beers on draft at all times. The first time I went here, my boyfriend got the sampler and it had 4 pale ales, which I was a little disappointed in (though they were pretty good). However, they rotate in 6 new beers every week or so (I'm guessing) so it's worth coming back frequently. I was there just the other day and got a Left Hand Milk Stout, which happens to be one of my favorites. So smooth, so good.

<Content> I'm not much of a meat eater, but Black Dog could change my mind. Their barbecue is just succulent. I am partial to the burnt ends sandwich with a side of their zippy potato salad. Their garden salads are good too and made with local artisan greens. Beer aficiandos will find a wide selection....order the flight of 6 samples to find what you like best. Two caveats: the wait for a seat can be very long and there's usually congestion at the front door. They need a space three times bigger than what they have now. Also, don't ever try to order vegetarian stuff. There's hardly any on the menu, and what I've tried isn't impressive. But who goes to Black Dog to be a vegetarian, anyway!

<Content> HANDS DOWN BEST FOOD IN THE AREA. Im currently living and San Diego but I grew up in Champaign/Urbana Illinois and until this place, the only comparable business was lil porgy's, not that I don't love porgy's, but this is just on another level of good. I know its hard to get their beef brisket BURNT ENDS. But if you can get their early enough on the weekend its worth the wait. I can't say enough good things about this place. Even their own sauces are amazing. You won't leave unsatisfied. I promise. Unless you don't like good BBQ, then you're weird anyways.

<Content> I am so sad I don't live in Urbana anymore! This is the best barbecue I've ever had. Whatever, I know, "don't overhype," but for the price and location it is fantastic.Best dishes: Burnt ends, which are smoked for twelve hours (!) and usually sell out at some point during the lunch shift (comes with the Carolina sauce, which is a bit spicy but genuinely amazing). Blue burger, which has blue cheese, bacon, and a peach barbecue sauce that has ruined every other blue burger I have tried so far. South Carolina burger, which has the same Carolina sauce as the burnt ends and comes with barbecue pork on top (no, it is not good for your cholestorol, but it it is totally worth it). Barbecue salmon (available as a special certain days) that seems strange in concept but basically melts into the barbecue sauce, and is (I assume) the healthiest option you'll come across. Also, the buns are weirdly good? I don't understand, but I appreciate it.Drinks: Go with a craft beer or whiskey list -- the options are many. I love the beer flights, as well.Sides: The cornbread is out of control. It comes with small bits of barbecue pork baked in. Also, it is the size of a piece of pie, so consider splitting. I would get a side of carolina sauces to dip in, it is amazing. Also, the baked beans are flavorful and made me like baked beans. Not as crazy about: The wait time, because it's a small space and the best casual dining in town. I would consider going at opening or in the mid-day lull. But I think they're opening a new location. Also, not a huge fan of the brisket (which is cool, because everything else is life changing).

<Content> The best BBQ in the area, and a good selection of craft beers on tap. The barbecue style is dry-rub which allows you to really taste the meats, rather than everything being covered in sauce.Everything is good, but the pulled pork, ribs, and chicken wings are my favorites. Also, try the corn bread. The bits of meat and peppers in the bread surprised me, but now it's the only cornbread I eat!

I like the beef brisket and the pit beans.My only complaints are that it gets very loud in there, and has bad acoustics. Also, I've noticed the food can be a bit inconsistent as I have the same meal almost every time. But other than that, I really like it.

<Content> My wife and I have now been to Black Dog Smoke & Ale House twice and have been absolutely blown away by the food and atmosphere. The first trip I had the full slab of ribs while my wife tried the brisket. Both were absolutely delicious. We even tried the full flight of sauce's and enjoyed them all. My wife adores the sweet potato fries.On our second trip, I had to try the pork belly sandwich...in fact, we both did. UNREAL. It is unbelievably tender, and the addition of their red cabbage slaw on the bun is a real nice addition. As for the beer, try the Sawtooth Ale. A very nice compliment to their BBQ. I now have a favorite new restaurant in Urbana. My only complaint, like others before me, is the size of the restaurant. I don't know that the owners knew their little eatery would be as overwhelmingly successful as it has become, because it can be quite difficult to get a seat. Their aren't many booths and/or tables in addition to the bar seating. We arrived at 4pm on a Saturday afternoon thinking it would be dead and still had to wait. Might be time to either add or move to a new location. In closing, I cannot recommend Black Dog enough. Just delicious, home cooked BBQ in the cornfields. Can't wait to try the "Burnt Ends" that everyone is raving about.

<Content> I have been to Black Dog 3 times in the last week if that says anything. I love their food, pretty much all of it. I get their ribs a lot but their burgers and sandwiches are hard to pass up. Don't forget to add on their sweet potato fries and their cornbread (the best cornbread I have ever had). Their other sides are very good but the sweet potato fries are so amazing its hard to pass them up. The chicken wings are possibly the best in town. All of the sauces are excellent, I highly recommend getting the sample sauce tray.Downside to this place is the wait but if you go early or late you generally only have to wait 15-20 minutes. I also suggest no more people than 4 as it is a very small place. The bar is a great place to sit so don't count it out.The beer selection is excellent and I highly recommend the flight if you have some time (and a DD). The cocktails are so good and strong, just the way they should be! My biggest wish is that they will open a second location in Downtown Champaign.

<Content> Like all the reviews say, this is a popular place. Plan to wait on the curb (literally) for your table with the rest of the hungry patrons. Ordered the platters (3 meat choices) and we mixed up the sides. Meat was excellent and the highlight was the burnt ends. Wow. Don't miss them. Sweet potato fries were good, but I've had better, probably because these ones had cooled down.This is a don't miss food destination that should satisfy your BBQ craving.

<Content> Seated in the heart of downtown Urbana, this restaurant gives the BBQ lover and anyone who loves a laid back, eclectic environment essentially nirvana. The help is great, and while you may wait a bit because it's generally busy (We went at 3:00 on Saturday and had a 10 minute wait), it's well worth it. Their menu is extensive and their selection of spirits was something that was pleasantly surprising. We all had different things and everyone was happy with their choices, and if you are a BBQ enthusiast, the house BBQ is definitely different, with a tangy vinegary taste with a nice smoky kick to it. If you haven't been there and have the opportunity, run, don't walk!!!

<Content> The best restaurant in the Champaign/Urbana area regardless of type of food, no question. I am originally from L.A and an almuni of the U of I, and in my 4 years in the area, this place consistently serves up the best meals. Whenever I go back down to school, I always make sure I go to Black Dog.Logistics: They won't seat you until your full party is there, and make sure you arrive on the earlier side of whatever meal you plan on going to (5,5:30pm is a good bet for dinner, 11am or so for lunch). The waiting area inside is very small, but there is a nice size bar and tvs.Food: Everything i've ever had from here is great. A go-to is always the combos, and obviously the BURNT ENDS have to be part of whatever creation you make. The ribs, pulled pork, brisket, rib tips, and all of the sandwiches and specials i've tried are delicious. There are some excellent sauces- Hot Georgia Peach and Carlina Red are my 2 favorites. As for sides, the thing to order is baked potato casserole- that alone might be the single best dish on my plate. They have specials all of the time and new dishes that are creative and unique.Beer: Always some local, midwest brews on tap, and they change it up very frequently. The beers they offer are seasonal, the the fall/winter beers are particularly tasty. A great place to get a great meal, some good beers, and watch some games.Service: The service is as good as the food, which is remarkable considering how busy the place gets. There always seems to be 2 waiters around which doesn't seem like much and really isn't- and they do run around, but the service is always fast, pleasant, and attentive. You never feel rushed, the waiters never seem to be too stressed, and they really do a great job.

<Content> Was driving back to WI from IN and based on the reviews from Yelp decided to eat lunch here. It did not disappoint!! When we opened the door to go in there was a LINE of people to be seated. We thought the wait would be really long, but they are quick there! There was two of us and one had the pulled pork and one had the brisket. Both had GREAT flavor - Very tender and delicious! We both had the Carolina Red sauce and loved it. One had sweet potato fries and one had regular fries - again, both were great! The staff was great - very friendly and quick service. Would definitely go back if driving through that way!

<Content> Simply put, Black Dog has excellent barbecue. I have yet to try something from the menu that I don't like, and I've actually been pleasantly surprised each time I've tried something new. I usually go for the pulled chicken sandwich (with locally raised, free-range chicken) with Georgia Peach BBQ sauce, and a side of sweet potato fries or pit beans. The chicken has always been incredibly moist, and the peach BBQ is a perfect compliment. Absolutely delicious. I've also tried the brisket, pork tacos, and burnt ends, which were amazing. The sides have also all been delicious, from the corn bread to the spicy potato salad.In addition to the food, the selection of beer on tap is typically pretty varied and affordable. I almost always get a beer with my meal...well, when I'm not feeling too cheap, that is. ;)The only thing that hasn't been consistently good is the service. Don't get me wrong, it's never been bad, per se. They've always been very friendly, but the waitstaff gets easily overwhelmed. So, if it's busy (which it will be around lunch time and early evening), just be patient and don't be afraid to get someone's attention if you feel you're not being noticed.If you love barbeque and supporting awesome local businesses, you should definitely give Black Dog a go.

<Content> The fact that I cannot even seem to get into the place at lunch makes me really want to give them less than 5 stars. At least 75% of the time, I have to go somewhere else because I can't spend my limited allotment of lunch break just standing around drooling.But the place is undeniable. Their burnt ends are a revelation. I could eat the Carolina Red sauce with a spoon. In a moment of semi-health consciousness, I ordered the applesauce, and even that knocked my socks off... literally. I spent 35 minutes trying to fish them out from under my table.I am so tempted to give the place 1 star and tell the rest of you yokels to go eat somewhere else. For goodness sake, let me have a lunch here every once in a blue moon. But I cannot do that for it would be a fib.Instead, I'll just be THAT guy standing over by the door... looking over your shoulder... and trying to use my powers of telepathy to get you to eat and leave sooner so I can sit down.

<Content> I'm pissed I only discovered this place in my last 2 years on campus. I think it's impossible to order anything and not like it, even a little.I was back on campus last weekend and tried the Chicken Wings - a seriously underestimated menu item. See, just when I think I've tried it all, I discover something else that's awesome.The chef likes to get creative with the daily specials too- so that's fun.Wow, I've already done all this raving and I haven't even had to start talking about their alcohol selection. In my opinion, it's a crime not to order a specialty beer off their vast tap list to wash down their killer BBQ. Students at U of I - get here as often as possible before graduation!

<Content> I'm a mostly-veggie eater, and I love this place. Their portabello sandwich is among the best I've ever had -- apparently smoking is the secret to cooking a big mushroom all the way through evenly and flavorfully. The catfish is also delicious. Love getting a flight of sauces and working my way through them between dinner and the excellent sides. I highly recommend the sweet potato fries and, if it's summer, the smoked sweet corn. Yum! As most everyone else has said, the meats are also delicious -- according to my husband and the tons of people we've brought here for lunch or dinner.Their tap list is relatively small -- they usually have somewhere around 7 beers at a time -- but there's always lovely choices. Recently, there's been some absolutely delicious dark pumpkin / apple fall beers! Bar and food service sometimes seems rushed, but surprisingly good for how busy they get.This place is insanely busy at pretty much all hours (30-min wait at 8.30pm on a Wednesday?), but it has still become our default for out-of-town guests. That says a whole heck of a lot.

<Content> Love, love, love Black Dog, and so happy that they're opening another location in downtown Champaign. There are only two downsides to the place: everything tends to be a bit smoky (so if you don't like that, be aware) and there's always a line out the door. The food is great. The pulled pork is a personal favorite, and while I never switch away from the Carolina Red (reminds me of barbecue at home) my friends love the Georgia Peach sauce. The brisket is also good- nice and tender- and the rib tips are fantastic. I don't like cornbread, but theirs is good (plus they bake meat into the bread- always a plus). They've recently slimmed down their beer menu a bit, but it's still very diverse, as is their whiskey menu. There are a lot of bourbons here that you can't order elsewhere in town (including Evan Williams 1783, a personal favorite). The place is too damn small and I wish they'd have burnt ends a bit more often (they're very good). But I can't really complain.

<Content> This place is easily my FAVORITE bbq joint in Chambana. I was beyond pleased with the food when it first opened (before the liquor license even), and even more thrilled now that there is a full bar and decent beer selection. The last time I went, the restaurant was offering beer flights. It was my bad luck that the flight they had that week was all dark beers (not my fave) but they do change the offerings in the flight. I always get the burnt ends (when they're not sold out) and sweet potato fries, but the Cuban sandwich special is also delicious. PS - try the different bbq sauces!

<Content> I'm not really a fan of BBQ (that's why I've waited this long to come here eventhough it gets great reviews), but I really enjoyed my meal here. I've always thought of BBQ as something people put together during the summer, not the kind of food you need to go to a restaurant for, but Black Dog's BBQ was simply the best I've ever had (but I guess that doesn't say much for a person who doesn't really go to restaurants that serve BBQ). Definitely coming back here again.

My friends and I all got different sauces and tried one another's. Carolina Red, the house sauce, and Chipotle were my favorites. I would also highly recommend the cornbread - it has pulled pork in it!

<Content> Surprisingly good BBQ in a small town! The sauces can be REALLY spicy, and I can handle my fair share of spiciness! The habanero and other sauce are different here... I've had spicy food/sauces that burn all the way through and linger for a long time, but Black Dog has sauces that burns going down, then it disappears (to give you hope), and reappears within 30 seconds to a minute... and then it burns and lingers for a long time. MADNESS! IF you're in Urbana-Champaign, try this spot!

<Content> I will concede that as someone who grew up in Champaign, and has since moved away, I tend to be a bit nostalgic about the town and may romanticize it a bit. I had never been to Black Dog when I lived in town, but on a recent visit some good friends told me it was THE place to go. We arrived around lunch time and we expected to wait for a table. The restaurant sits MAYBE 30 people, and this is a good thing. We only had to wait about 15 minutes, which given the number of people and the small seating area, I thought was pertty good.Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made great suggestions. I ended up ordering brisket and pulled pork. Both were delicious. The smoke ring on the brisket was a beautiful color and all the flavor was there. The house BBQ sauce which came with the meal was EXCELLENT and though I have heard that they have several other options, I'm not sure there would ever be any need.Another bonus was that Black Dog had a small, but great, beer selection. They had 7 beers on draft, all of which were really good. They offered a sampler of 4 oz. pours, which was a great thing to enjoy with my meal. It was a LITTLE nerdy that the beers were served in a "dog bone" shaped serving platter, but I suppose it was fun.Overall, I had a great experience at Black Dog and I would love to return on my next visit.

<Content> Finally was able to get in to this place; there's always a line out the door, which speaks to the quality.Made it there around 8:30 on a Saturday night, and immediately got a seat at the bar. Smoked catfish sandwich was probably the best sandwich I ever had. Twice-baked potatoes were an excellent side.But the best thing was the waiter; when I told him what beer I wanted, he said, "Well, it's OK, but how often will you come here?" He pointed me instead to a Founder's seasonal release which was phenomenal. The only problem now is: what do I do with all the beer I already have at home?Came back the following (Super Bowl) night, and the burnt ends were not sold out - and it was just as good as the night before.I will definitely be back!

<Content> Even though myself and my girlfriend showed up around 5, there was already a line waiting to be seated. This establishment is small, and if you are going around dinner time, be prepared to wait. However, we found it to be well worth waiting for once we were seated (which was actually at a weird sort-of-bar at the back of the restaurant). I am not a barbecue aficionado, but this was definitely the best place I have ever been to. I got a pulled pork sandwich, since I had read so much about it, and was definitely not disappointed (I was pleasantly surprised at the fact it was served with slaw on top). My girlfriend got a brisket sandwich, which was very good, though I preferred my sandwich. In addition, we got sweet potato fries, which were delicious.They had a fairly extensive drink menu for a restaurant, though not quite as large as a few of the other establishments in the Champaign/Urbana area. Their draft beer selection was good, and they had a good selection of bottled beer. In addition to this, the service was both prompt and pleasant, and when I ordered a bottle of Lone Star after having Dogfish Head, the waitress (thankfully) talked me out of downgrading like that (I was... unfamiliar... with Lone Star, I guess it is like Budweiser).Overall, I was very satisfied with this restaurant, and I plan on going again soon (though I have to pick a time when I'm not terribly hungry, due to the wait).

<Content> I came in sometime around 3:30 looking to eat what became my only real meal of the day. (Raise your hand if you've been there before on a Sunday). My friend, a recent transplant to the area, suggested a "pretty sweet BBQ place" instead of the much closer and cheaper McDonald's near his apartment. "Oh, and they also have their own beer." Sold. So, walking in, the seating space is really rather small for a pub/restaurant - and way too hungry to wait for a table - so we just sat at the bar. I Yelped this place before leaving and was told to try the Burnt Ends but to get there early to do so. Well, they were out. And they were also out of catfish. Luck of the draw of coming in late on an NFL playoff game day, I suppose. I ended up getting the rib tips with regular French fries and the Southwestern potato salad, with the Left Hand Milk Stout to drink. I mean, if I'm gonna carbo-load, why not do it in style?Anyway, our first server ended up also giving me a small sample of a blueberry ale just in case I'd be coming back or ordering more beer with my dinner. I suppose if I liked blueberries, I'd be all over this, but I'm not such a fan... however, I certainly appreciate the offer. I also ended up having the one beer of theirs they had on tap the night before at a bar, so I didn't want to double dip and ended up going with a Hennepin saison instead.The food finally came, after many delays informing my friend that supply was limited on catfish and eventually running out of it. The Carolina Red BBQ sauce is very tasty but has a hidden kick to it. With the rib tips, it was perfect. That said - though the fries were great (but maybe a bit skimpy on the serving size) and the Southwestern potato salad was good (but I was almost hoping for it to be a bit closer to room temperature), the rib tips themselves were tender and flavorful, but I thought there was a bit too much fat on them, whether marbled in or around the little bits of bone. The parts closer to the edges were fine, but towards the center were tricky. I don't want to imply that this is standard practice, but due to having to cancel both items my friend ordered, he was able to substitute something else on the menu and get comped for it on the bill. Much appreciated. However, our original server kind of disappeared for a while so we ended up being served by a guy that sort of looks like Paul McCartney around 1968, and he did a great job.

<Content> I'm not sure what else there is to say about Black Dog that hasn't already been said.It's the best barbecue in Central Illinois. It has an excellent whiskey selection and always carries a few good draft beers (that are usually different from the beers on tap at other bars in town).The place is small and at peak hours the wait approaches absurdity.Eat the burnt ends. Eat the corn bread.And I'm not sure I'm supposed to tell you this, but if you are a spicy food lover, they have an off-menu Ghost Pepper sauce that will wreck you. And I mean what I say. Wrecked. They should make you sign a waiver to even serve you the stuff.Just go. But if you're smart, get hungry between 2-5pm. Or be there before they open.

And Black Dog is my #1 favorite of all those food-serving places. It's cozy, with friendly staff who give the place a neighborhood-bar feel. Come with a friend and you can get seated at the bar, even at peak time, without having to wait too long. Come with more than one friend and you'll have to wait, but DEAL WITH IT DAWG. Patience is a virtue, and pulled pork BBQ with Hot Georgia Peach will be in you soon.

<Content> This place is perfect except for the long lines and running out of the smoked meats later in the evening. I would recommend going during lunchtime or right at 5pm if you don't want to wait.The bbq is amazing, I usually have the pulled pork but their beef is great as well. Sweet potato fries are excellent, and their pit beans are really delicious too. Their sauce actually isn't all that great, too much vinegar and not enough spice, but the taste of the meat is so perfect that it doesn't matter. I'd recommend having the sauce on the side.Beer selection is good and they always have a few great choices on tap. Best bbq place (if not the best restaurant period) in Champaign-Urbana, hands down.

<Content> This place will forever have a specisl time in my heart now. I've been in Urbana-Champaign for one semester and I have been here a total of five times. The service is generally fast and there is at least one waiter that id absolutely hilarious. It is not their fault that there is almost always a wait. If you want a table fast, I recommend showing up after the lunch-rush is over but before the dinner-crowd starts to arrive. The food is spectacular and you will enjoy every bite. I strongly recommend trying the cornbread appetizer. It is heavenly.

<Content> As we entered we were enthusiastically greeted by one of the servers. Hopefully, as you'd expect, all of the staff members are as nice as she is, come to find out the bartender we had wasn't as peachy. Not that she was mean, just general going through the motions and not just for us but for all guests seated at the bar. The food was decently good, just not as finger-lickin amazing as everyone I have spoken with prior to this visit made me feel it was going to be. I did really enjoy their sweet potato fries (nice and crisp and thick). The chicken sandwich I had was good, once the barbecue sauce was able to make its way down to the pulled chicken on the bottom of the bun. Otherwise, it was a bit dry. My boyfriend had the Carolina sandwich and he enjoyed that along with the potato salad as his side.A good selection of alcoholic beverages with not the largest selection of beers. The "Ale House" part of the name gave us the impression that maybe there were several selections on tap but, as I recall, there weren't a ton nor could we see the tap handles (outside of 1) to get a visual (sometimes that's nice to see). Of course there was a beer list, though. Overall, not a terrible experience but just a basic one. Nothing crazy.

<Content> I'm a big fan of BBQ and was excited to try this place. I got pulled pork, burnt ends, and ribs. The pork was a little more dry than I like, the burnt ends are amazing! (Will keep me coming back) the ribs were a total let down, too dry and chewy. The sauces are great but they default to one so be sure to tell them what you want.

<Content> Edit: Flaws ironed out and the Black Dog is Heaven! Full 5-star experience every time!Original review: Very good! In brief, my wife and I have found the service to be friendly and efficient, the food to be intensely flavorful, and the cost quite reasonable. Add to this good beer, and you have a restaurant that it is fast becoming our default meal when we don't have a specific craving and just want a nice night out.We have eaten widely from the menu, and especially recommend the wings, the pulled pork, and the cornbread. They often have specials, which so far have also been great.There are still a few small kinks, such as only having four napkin dispensers along the entire bar that seats 15 or so people (I had to ask for napkins, which one should never need to do at a barbecue joint! And then they needed to be taken away for someone else, and I had to ask for them again...). Hopefully the owners read reviews and/or use their common sense to iron out what few flaws currently exist.

<Content> The largest problem that I have with Yelp reviews of restaurants is that it doesn't have separate categories for reviews of service, decor, atmosphere and the food itself (which is why one usually reads reviews for, ironically). In order to facilitate easy understanding of my opinions, please note that the Rating is in relation to the quality of the food itself while the other categories will be rated below. Service: 3.5 - depending on the crowd one can either get their food fairly quickly or 40 minutes later; I am a huge fan of the BBQ here but a couple of weeks ago, with a large crowd, I had to wait at least 40 mins for my Catifsh sandwich. Decor: 3 - nothing to write home about but they do have 2 large flatscreens always showing sports so its nice to sit at the bar with a good beer and food in order to enhance one's viewing experience. Food: 5 - It is hands down, the best BBQ in the area. The quality per price ratio is also top notch since the larger helpings will usually tide people over for leftovers as well as fill those who are ravenous. The beer here is really good and reflective of the overall abundance of good microbrews and international beers available in the Champaign-Urbana area. My favorites here are the burnt ends, beef brisket, ribs, catfish, pit beans and the mac cheese special side on Thursdays.

<Content> 3.5 stars. Very good, not spectacular. The ribs were smoky but still kind of tough and the house sauce wasn't a great complement. I heard good things about the burnt ends but they were sold out. The brisket was outstanding; I'd come back again and again for it. Worth the visit alone.Their potato souffle thing was overcooked and average. Beans were reheated in the microwave and the foam container melted, kind of gross looking but the beans were decent. Service isn't too friendly, but I never judge places based upon if they smile or not as long as the food comes out hot, and in this case it was so hot the container side melted.

<Content> I like Black Dog. It's one of the better places in CU. I enjoy the Cuban sandwich and the pulled pork is good, too. Great beer selection. I usually get the sweet potato fries.The customer service is not good, though. I've had indifferent and flat out rude service, in fact. The wait is often long, too.

<Content> Love this place! Everything I've had here has been awesome. The cornbread, BBQ, I've even had the Cuban which was good. The service has always been passable. This is after all a bar, and I'd rather have my servers be brief and move people and food than have to wait in a line for 45 min because they took their time and were super chatty (as opposed to the 45 min wait because the food is great).

<Content> This is my favorite restaurant in Champaign-Urbana. It's not perfect, but if I had let myself, I probably could've eaten there every week. The downside is that it is small. Small to the point where I would do ridiculous things and tell my group of friends "everyone get there at 10:45am". Oh, and your entire party has to be there if you want to be seated. But the bbq. Fantastic. Get the burnt ends if they aren't out for the day (they run out on those early). They also tend to have an interesting beer selection. Sides are good, too. My bbq of choice was the hot Georgia Peach. Personal favorite combination was the burnt ends sandwich with hot Georgia Peach sauce and sweet potato fries on the side. The cornbread is good, too (it does have meat in it though).

<Content> Everything here is great. Rivals some of the best BBQ I've had in the GA and NC (the basis for many of their sauces). I'll also add that they know how to do takeout well. BBQ is a hard food to get right for takeout, but both times I've had it it's tasted almost as good as when I've eaten there.That may help solve some of the long wait problems that people have correctly pointed out.

<Content> Great freaking BBQ!!! it's not the sauce, it's the smoked meat! Best Brisket I've had for sure! Tender like no other!! The wait may be long, but worth it. Drove by last night and didn't want to wait cuz of the big crowds waiting outside...yup regretting it now! Could have tried some of their other faire...now wishing I had a bigger belly to stuff with brew and BBQ.

<Content> The food and beer are really good. As stated in many other reviews, this place is really small. Prices are pretty reasonable. The smoked catfish and sweet potato fries were just smokey and soft. The beer sampler is worth a try. There is a good selection of stouts if you like them. This place is a must visit if you are in the Champaign-Urbana area.

<Content> Best food in CU.Excellent cornbread with peppers and pulled pork baked into it. Pulled pork & briskets are both good, the burnt tips are the best item but they run out quickly at lunch and dinner. A few excellent sauces. My fave: hot georgia peach, but the carolina vinegar & mustard are good. The sides are good: excellent slaw, good baked beans, & decent potato salad. Great beer selection, better brown liquor selection. As a bonus, they occasionally have neat add ons like smoked ice (turns your bourbon into scotch). The downside: the restaurant selection in CU is so impoverished that Black Dog is always crowded, and I mean crowded as heck (this includes a Thurs at 2pm in late May after the undergrads left). My tip: get takeout. It's inexpensive (especially because you're saving the cost of alcohol). Just don't get the fries as a side.

<Content> The best BBQ in the city, hands down! Be prepared to wait a little while to be seated (it's that GOOD) but worth the wait! The servers were very helpful and knowledgable & I enjoyed the atmosphered. The pulled pork was DELICIOUS, upset I was not able to try the burnt ends due to them being sold out - as they were highly recommended. Overall, it was a great date with my fianc and we are HIGHLY anticipating our return!

<Content> Black Dog has THE best BBQ in the Champaign/Urbana area hands down. Now all they need is a larger space to serve it in, i love the bar setting, but not one that has outgrown its space because of how good their product is. Waits are common of up to 30 mins anytime you go.As for the food, lets start with the Wings appetizer, delicious smoked wings and the kick of the Carolina BBQ sauce puts them over the top. My wife can't stop talking about how good the burnt ends are, and she must not be the only one because the sell out frequently.  Loved the ribs, just wish they had some baby backs to choose from.All in all you will not beat this place for BBQ anywhere within a hundred miles!

<Content> "Best Food In Champaign-Urbana!"Although there is always generally a wait, and if you want their delicious Burnt Ends you have to come early in the evening, Black Dog is well worth it. Nearly everything you order at Black Dog is excellent. The southern-style smoky greatness of their BBQ and sides is mouth watering. Black Dog offers a great list of whiskeys and also serves many good micro-brews. Burnt Ends and Spare Ribs are extremely good, as is their side order of Smoky Pit Beans. Occasionally I'll order a Carolina Burger, which is a burger with pull pork on top, when I want to mix things up. Many people rave about their corn bread, as it is also delicious. Daily specials help keep the mix of food fresh, however I could never grow tired of Black Dog. Recently the restaurant started serving special Late Night items after 10:30pm that features special cocktails and menu items (like Gourmet Hot Dogs/Sausages) that you cannot order during regular hours, which are great as well. Try Black Dog, you won't regret it, but you might just feel frustrated thinking about the soonest time you can come back for more. Note: When choosing a sauce, Hot Georgia Peach is the way to go. (But hell, you can order a Flight of Sauces and try them all for yourself. Enjoy!)

<Content> Food is very good. my favorite is the burnt end sandwich. Sweet potato fries are okay but it's a bit dry, should probably dip it in honey or something. However my one biggest complaint is the wait. every time i've came here it's been an hour wait. The burnt ends are usually gone long before dinner. In fact, i got laughed at once when I came in at 9pm asking for burnt ends. It's good that it's opened till 11pm which is an hour more than most restaurants on campus. However, considering the amount you pay, I would rather go to lil porgy's.. better bang for my buck and their rib tips are ah mazing for less than $6.

<Content> Can I give this more than 5 stars? The food was amazing. Be prepared to wait. It's well worth it though. We came at 1:45 and there was still a line out the door. They were out of some food, but to me that was a good sign. The corn bread was awesome- who would think to put chillies, and pulled pork IN a corn bread? Genius.The pulled pork was big and delicious and SMOKEY. mmm. Potato salad had a nice flavor/kick to it. Anyways, I'm sure I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said 245 times already though. Do yourself a favor and get in line at the Black Dog already.

<Content> Everything I have had here is phenomenal: Beef ends, pulled pork, brisket, and obviously the sweet potato fries. The service is disappointing, though. There is always a crowd waiting to be seated, and so the servers are very rushed. The problem is that they let you know this. I was there on a Saturday night, and our server handed us out menus and immediately demanded to know what our drinks orders were. The look of annoyance on his face when I asked for something they don't have was obvious. Sorry you had to stand at our table for an extra 10 seconds. Then when we were leaving, I quickly placed my purse on the table while I put my coat on. The lady cleaning up immediately asked "Whose purse is this?" So while the food is amazing and I will be back, don't expect to be treated as anything more than a number to be rushed in and out as fast as possible.

<Content> I don't live in Urbana anymore and this is definitely one of the places I miss the most! I have never once been disappointed by the food or service at this place.Do yourself a favor and start off with the Texas Caviar as an appetizer, you can thank me later.I normally always got the smoked salmon sandwich. I've never been a huge fan of coleslaw, but the way theirs is prepared, and ON the actual sandwich, is just delicious. The sweet potato fries are too good as is any other side I've ever ventured to try.Also the, I think it's called the Carolina burger, a fat delicious burger with pulled pork on top is really good too!You may very well have to wait, but it is so so so worth it.

<Content> Please, please, please, put one of these restaurants in Bloomington-Normal.Although this restaurant is small, the pulled pork sandwich that I ordered was wonderful.   The mixture of pork, coleslaw, and Georgia Peach bbq sauce that they put on the sandwich really hit the spot.The sweet potato fries were solid too.My only complaint about the food was with the "hot" version of the Georgia Peach bbq sauce that we also tried. Avoid it - the restaurant needs to tweak that sauce a bit.  It's really hot.

<Content> Delicious, delicious barbecue. I didn't even know that I liked barbecue until I ate at Black Dog for the first time. I recommend any of the sandwiches, and the spicy southwest potato salad is SPICY and wonderful. The corn bread is dense and buttery with pieces of pulled pork inside; very filling and rich and tasty.You will almost always have to wait for a table at this restaurant because the space is so small. I've heard that ordering take-out works really well to cut down the waiting time before you get to eat, but I haven't tried it yet. The waitstaff are always friendly, though sometimes a little frazzled from the huge numbers of customers coming through for the amazing food.

<Content> My wife's birthday was over the weekend, and it seemed like having a good lunch was in the cards. Being a big barbeque fan, she selected the Black Dog Smoke & Ale House. We had heard so many good things about it that we finally decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed.We were aware that the biggest drawback would be the wait for a table, so we left home early to get there right before it opened. Several other people had the same idea. We were given a nice greeting upon entering and were seated immediately. We were told that we might have a bit of a wait for service since we were seated before the place opened, but our waitress came by right away. We decided to start the meal with the appetizer we were most curious about: the burnt ends. Although a tad pricy, the meat lived up to everything we had read -- flavorful, wonderfully chewy around the edges, with melt-in-your mouth smoky goodness.For our lunch, we both had pulled pork sandwiches, sweet potato fries, and an additional side of twice baked potato casserole. The sandwiches were excellent -- wonderfull smokey meat, slaw, and excellent Carolina Red barbeque sauce. The sweet potato french fries actually tasted like sweet potatoes, but I am not sure why others have raved about them. They were just okay, as was the casserole. But ... we came to this place looking for excellent barbecue, and it delivered!We were happy we decided to eat right when the place opened because a line formed as we were eating our lunch. We decided to make a quick exit so that someone else could get our table. We were in and out in about 35 minutes.Would we come here again? Definitely! Next time I would like to try the Georgia Peach barbeque sauce and sample the chicken and catfish. I decided to only go with four stars because the sides were only average in our estimation. Next time we will try some others.

<Content> My searching is over! Hands down best BBQ in the whole C-U area! Prices are EXTREMELY low and food is exceptional! My friends and I visit this place embarrassingly often.Only cons: Very small and most people leave after seeing the line of people waiting to be seated. I don't think there is ever not a line. HOWEVER, it is very worth it, they do their best to sit you in a timely fashion and once you start eating you will forget that you waited. Sadly, because it is very crowded the staff seems to get a bit irritated (for good reason) so if you want great service I wouldn't go at the end of a lunch/dinner rush. Again, I'm all about the food so as long as they bring it to me I don't really care. Try it. I have never had anything bad. Wait in line and you'll thank me later.

I had the spicy potato salad, though the side was small it was homely and unique in that it was homemade. Also, I recommend getting the sauce platter unless you know for sure your sauce for bbq. It is just easier for you to pick and your know if the placr is any good. Also the waiter was nice filled our glasses on a regular basis. He also made sure everybody seating had enough space to eat comfortably because its a small place. Will go back again for sure

The most troubling thing that I experienced was the gentleman working behind the bar go and grab a handful of cornbread concotion (with NO GLOVES ON) and put in on someones tray!!! I looked down at my cornbread concotion and push it away! Just wrong! and Hickory Rivers' pulled pork is soooo much better than this place!

Is it the best BBQ I've ever had in my life and justifies waiting 2 hours in line to only be told half the menu has been sold out? Maybe not, but ordering for pick up is perfectly reasonable and an excellent choice.

<Content> If you like really dry, overcooked ribs and tips, come to this place. We came with a big group and it was already packed, so we decided to do carryout. It turned out to be 30 mins of waiting in a small cramped restaurant, with people constantly walking by forcing you to move, when our food finally came. There was also a guy walking out telling me, "not worth the wait." I didn't think too much of it because the place looked promising. We went back to eat it and took about 10 mins figuring out who ordered what. They place all of our food together in 3 bags, which was fine, but they didn't labeled anything. We ordered the combo which included pulled pork, slab of ribs, and rib tips. I only tried the ribs and tips, but they were really dry and the sauce didn't make it any better. I have tried many great ribs, but this one definitely don't cut it. As busy as it gets here, the guy was right, definitely not worth the wait.

<Content> I've heard such great things about this place and was anxious to give it a try.The night we went, their smoker was broken! So all their famous barbecue dishes were unavailable! Seems like they could have told us this before we waited 1/2 hour for a table! We were hungry, so we stayed anyway, and had burgers. They were decent, but I went there for barbecue!So if you go, you might want to ask when you get there if there are any problems in the kitchen...

<Content> You will see a line, possibly overflowing outside of the door. It is there for a reason. Find the gentleman or the lady taking the names for the queue and just wait... patiently... Black Dog's food is a privilege rewarded only to the most patient and determined.  Take a note of the daily lunch and dinner specials. Some of those are really unique. If they haven't run out of the burnt ends, get that. Otherwise close your eyes and randomly point at something on the menu. Doesn't matter really because everything is top notch. If you are hungry, get the corn bread appetizer as well. As far as the sides go, the casserole is a crowd favorite. I also like the pit beans and the sweet potato fries. If your item has bbq sauce, note that you have some options besides the house one, all of them offering a different flavor experience. This place deserves 6 stars and then some.

<Content> If you are in the Urbana-Champaign area, dinning at this join is a must! Without a doubt they have great BBQ sauces, great rib tips, and overall its affordable!If your party consists of more than 2 people plan on a long wait. (at least 30-45 minutes) unless you come right when they open. Fox News placed Black Dog in Top 10 BBQ places in the US. Their service isn't quite top notch (Since this place is always crowded)Pros: good food, afforadable eat.Cons: long wait, average to below average serviceRecommendation: call in and place an order for pick up. Sit at home or park anywhere else and enjoy their delicious food without having to wait for long.

<Content> We've been going to Black Dog almost every week for the last couple of years. Great place if you don't mind the wait. If you mind the wait, go for lunch on weekdays or choose odd hours, when most people don't have their lunch or dinner. Most of their food is really good. I particularly like the pork belly sandwich and the rib tips.

<Content> I've been to Black Dog on awkward first dates, with a group of people I didn't know, and to lunch with an ex. And yet, I've never had an unpleasant experience at Black Dog. The burnt ends are basically legendary. I had never been there early enough to try them until yesterday. Yeah, they're amazing. It's no wonder they sell out before 12:45 pretty much every day. The barbecue is divine, the sauces fiery, the fries crispy, and the beer cold - and all for a terrific price (and friendly service!). Lunch for two with one appetizer, one sandwich, one platter, one soft drink and one beer - $32 before tip, and there were even some leftovers to take home. The only downside I can see, other than the occasional out-of-stock menu item, is the seating issue. There's definitely not enough space. However, they do make it fantastically easy to get a meal to-go, plus some relaxing outdoor seating for the warmer months. If you come with a group, make sure everyone is there on time, or you'll be waiting until the last person arrives, and then some. Still - it's worth the wait.

<Content> Black Dog is the best barbeque in the Champaign-Urbana area. The pulled pork sandwich and burnt ends are the greatest things on the menu. If you can, get sweet potato fries. They are also to die for. No reservations, so go at an off time, around 4 and you'll be set without a wait (probably). Try all the sauces! I love the Hot Georgia Peach, but the Carolina Red is always a favorite.

<Content> Best place to eat in Champaign-Urbana area. Seriously this barbecue is as good as it gets. Lines can be long but if you go on the "off hours" in between meal times, the lines aren't long at all. Best thing I like to get is the carolina and texas burgers. Probably the best burger i've ever had! so yummy. I just love the barbecue sauce they use! It's so delicious! I bring all my friends and family here when they visit =]

<Content> This is by far my absolute favorite restaurant in the Urbana-Champaign area. Everything, literally everything, on the menu is delicious. Diverse beer selection, friendly and quirky wait staff, and great overall atmosphere. Get there early (before 5) because the place is small, and fills up quickly, especially on weekends. Sometimes they run out of burnt ends, but luckily there are plenty of other items that are just as good (I recommend the polish sausage). I love that you get to pick from a variety of sauces, which are all great; ask your server for a recommendation if you can't choose. Side dishes I highly recommend are the sweet potato fries, and the twice baked casserole.

<Content> We loved it. Some if the best BBQ ever. The corn bread was tops and the slaw tasty. My wife is a vegetarian and when we discovered the corn bread and red beans and rice both have meat, the server could not have been more accommodating. The beer selection is great and our meal was only $35 for two (and that's with two drinks each). I may go back tomorrow for lunch!Late addition. We went back and had another great experience. This place is the bomb

<Content> After many years of living in Champaign/Urbana this is the place to take friends, guests, and all the like. The restaurant is a tad small but I think that adds immensely to its charm. The smells are fabulous and will have you drooling. There is usually a wait unless you come at an off meal time so expect that. The prices are reasonable and their is always a great beer selection to choose from. Love their weekly specials especially Cuban Sandwich Wednesday - brings back a lot of fond memories. Get there early though so they don't run out of what you want (:

<Content> I can be a bit critical of bbq, and I love this place. The meat is good enough without sauce, and that's all I need.I recommend the smoked catfish. I haven't had any smoked fish like this; it's amazing. The service is nice, kind waitress. I guess they can run out of food. That's kind of like the good bbq joints you would run across in the South. Go early.

<Content> I love this place. Plenty of people have written about the food (too many amazing dishes to list, but I could live on the sweet potato fries and the ribs) and the beer (the selection is so good, and it rotates, and it's so cold and delicious). But once you get spoiled enough by the food, and you start to take it for granted, because after all you know that it will be fantastic and you don't care if you have to wait, and you don't even care if you have to sit at the weird little time out table in the very back, you start to ask yourself the hard questions. What exactly is it that makes this place so amazing? What is the one ingredient that brings it all into harmony? Well, after twenty visits, I've figure it out. It's that waiter. You know the one. The ironic hipster with the glasses and the longish hair who knows every single thing about all of the beer selections and all of the food and who is probably the guy responsible for the fact that Tom Waits is playing and you can just hear it under the really loud sound of the game on the tv at the bar. This guy is free from the shackles of his hipster tribe, because he's nice. He's kind. He will figure you out and he will use this knowledge responsibly. This guy will tell you everything you need to know. He will not patronize you, rush you, brush you off, or forget your table. He will shine his magical hipster/doofus sparkle charm on you. He is the patron saint of this restaurant. Go there and ask him to tell you what to eat and what to drink. Obey him. Thank him. Seriously, who is this guy? I love this guy.

<Content> My dear black dogs, the best place I've ever eaten at in my life. I left Illinois a while ago and sadly have never found a place in the North or Western states that can compare. I remember how the sauces were so good I'd shred the meat so it could get as much surface area of sauce as possible, cleaning out each cup of sauce.Thank you for putting soul into food.

<Content> It always amuses me how a place becomes the "In" spot in town and then shows an arrogance towards its customers that conveys the sense of superiority. It's like they're doing you a favor by serving you, rather than you doing them a favor by patronizing the place. It's too bad because the food is good, although not the sublime experience that some people claim. Yes, the burnt ends are delicious -- if you can ever get them. Forget about seating. Forget about customer service. Get take out, if you can find someone who will condescend to wait on you. For the food I'd give four stars but for the general dining experience, two is the best I can muster. The beer selection is decent but not spectacular for a true beer lover. I agree with Dan W.: Good food, bad service.

<Content> My perspective: I've spent a good deal of time in Austin, Texas, which is the center of the BBQ loop trail that goes through tiny towns like Taylor, Lockhart, and Fredericksburg. The places in these towns are like institutions, with heritage and loyalty passed down from one generation to the next. People are on a first-name basis with the cutter and pit man.My all-time favorite: Franklin BBQ, which was recently named best bbq in America by Bon Appetit. It's also gotten rave reviews from the NY Times, Food and Wine, and the only perfect rating from fcg-bbq, a bbq joint blog with its nose seriously to the ground, and whose opinion I take to be more authoritative than any national magazine.I know BBQ is more than what Texans call 'brisket', but when done right, brisket is so good that it's hard to see what else one could want from BBQ.If you're looking for what Texans call ' wet brisket' or 'moist brisket', here's how to get the most out of Black Dog: go from Sunday to Thursday when the pit man Jay is working. The wet brisket ( or what people around here call 'burnt ends') is best in the evenings.Order a burnt ends platter, and ASK YOUR SERVER TO NOT TRIM ANY FAT. Tell him or her that you want about a 50-50 meat/fat ratio with plenty of the fat webbing between the little nodules of meat.Ask for sauce only on the side. Ideally, you won't be needing any.Make sure to ask for white onions, because they default to red. And pickles. And try to get some white bread.If it's at all dry or tough, talk to your server and send it back.Jay will know what you're looking for. He has been to Texas. He will speak your language.

<Content> My buddy and I went there on a Saturday night around 7-I'd never been there but heard it was good and i'm kind of chubby, ex post facto, I dig barbeque. Anyhow I went in there and ordered burnt ends (the bartender scoffed that I would attempt to order those after 6, I guess they're always out after that time) Anyhow so I just got a pulled pork sandwich with some slaw on top and sweet potato fries. The food all in all was great as well with the service. Even the craft beer left me wanting more. While the place is small it has kind of a more homey feel rather than cramped. I'll definitely eat there again and maybe try to get there before 6 next time!

They both loved the food and the drinks here. My dad loves to drink and he told me this place is one the best pubs he has been to. I personally love the BBQ ribs, it is the best one I ever had. One thing worth mention is you gotta wait in line for awhile before you can be seated.

The only downside, limited space. I had to wait around half an hour before i could be seated, but it was well worth the wait. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant to ANYBODY because I don't want to have to wait even longer for my little piece of BBQ heaven. Best BBQ in Chambana.

<Content> I was in town from Chicago visiting my friend for the weekend and she suggested this place when I told her I was craving bbq. She spoke very highly of it and I was so excited to try it!!! I would like to say first and foremost that I have been in the restaurant/bar industry for around 6 years and I know what it is like to work in a busy environment...though there was a wait, it was NOT busy enough to provide THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.We arrived and the hostess (a gentleman) greeted us with a face of annoyance. I saw an extra chair at the bar and asked if we could pull up an extra one and sit there. With annoyance he answered with "Not right now." We were never told that the bar was also a part of the seating wait. We asked how long the wait was and received yet another look of annoyance stating there were sixteen tables waiting ahead of us with no time frame. I really wanted to try the food so we decided to take it to go. By this time I was upset considering, like i previously mentioned, I work in the industry and know how to give customer service to build rapport. I asked the guy taking our order if the hostess was the owner and he informed me that the hostess wasn't but he in fact was the owner, omitting to ask if there was something he could do for us. I did not mention what horrible service we were receiving because I like to be more professional but while we were waiting for our food we over heard two other customers become disappointed at the responses they were receiving from the hostess. Honestly though the food was good my friend nor I will EVER come back here. Come on dude, step up your game if your gonna be a popular place in a small town. AWFUL SERVICE!!!!

Nevertheless, the BBQ is so good I eat it without!Baked Potato Casserole is my favorite side, usually get two of them. Be prepared to wait and make sure your whole party is there otherwise they won't seat you. Great whiskey flights, good service.

Six beers on tap all leaning towards IPA and a huge selection of bottled beer. Not worth an hours wait. The sauces are tomato based. Neat little bar with good BBQ. Super selection of Bourbon, whisky and rye. Samplers of beer and whisky are available. Wait staff are super.

<Content> Although I cannot boast a lifelong relationship with BBQ, I know what my taste buds are fans of, and Black Dog is it. Wednesdays are Cuban sandwiches and a side of the twice-baked potato. We have been here for dinner as well, when I had the privilege of eating a delicious polish. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly and on top of things. My only complaint is how busy they are, but the food is so good that I will not withhold stars just because it takes me a few minutes to get seated.

Real smoked pork and brisket. The smoked salmon is tremendous and the twice baked casserole. Beer selection rotates almost weekly and they even have something on cask most of the time. There is ample parking on street and in an adjoining lot. More seating would make it perfect!

I ate here the first week they opened and the quality of the BBQ astounded me at the time - it has only gotten better since. I hope it does well because the trip to Urbana is faster than driving to 17th Street BBQ in Murphysboro. The Pit Beans are totally necessary as a side. They also have a decent beer selection with some good microbrews on tap.

<Content> Black Dog is the best BBQ I've had. The meat always comes out perfectly tender, and I like the fact they give you a choice of sauces. All of the sides are excellent. I usually order the pulled pork and the brisket, although I occasionally will get a hot link. For sides, the twice baked potatoes and pit beans are probably my favorites, with honorable mention going to the sweet potato fries.I also have tried the burritos (only served at lunch time) and they were excellent.I live in Chicago now (after living in Urbana for about 6.5 years), and I have been unable to find a BBQ place in Chicago that even comes close to Black Dog. This came as a huge surprise to me since I just assumed somewhere in Chicago there'd be something this good, but it has just been a series of disappointments. When I want BBQ, what I really want is Black Dog.I recently went down to visit Urbana, partially for an excuse to eat here. The beer selection at Black Dog is also phenomenal. I discovered several relatively obscure beers I had never heard that have since become regular favorites. (New Holland Dragons Milk being one of them). I think Black Dog has a more interesting beer selection than the Blind Pig some of the time.Be prepared to wait a while, but the wait is worth it. They might want to consider expanding to a larger location, one always worries about that since it might mess with success. I think they could probably sustain it though considering this is almost a regional draw.

<Content> This is a smallish place. We arrived for a late weekend lunch and waited about 20 minutes for a table. The restaurant is long and narrow. At the front is an area with a few high-top tables. There is a long bar with several bar stools. Against the wall and opposite the bar are booths.The menu includes a variety of bottled and draft craft beers. We enjoyed a wheat beer while we waited for our table. The menu is devoted to barbecue. Our starters included cornbread (very different from what I've tried in the past as it included peppers) and smoked wings accompanied by a North Carolina sauce and a blue-cheese dip on the side. We ordered sandwiches, all of which were uniformly excellent (a pulled-pork sandwich, a brisket sandwich and a pulled chicken sandwich). They were accompanied by a North Carolina sauce (you can request another sauce) and side dishes. The baked potato casserole was something like a twice-baked potato minus the potato skin and was also very good. The food was so good we didn't mind the wait at all.

<Content> This was one of our favorite places in grad school, hands down. Each of my friends groups loved this place and it's great for takeout so I must have been here over 30 times in two years. And now that I've moved to a region with crappy BBQ, I dream of Black Dog's brisket and wonder why I moved here. Job, schmob.I've been coming here ever since the first week they opened and they've really come a long way. The food was always delicious, but they ironed out the kinks and expanded the menu. Everything is delicious. You really can't go wrong.The ribs, brisket and pulled pork are AMAZING. The brisket is my favorite, hands down. I've had brisket at other places and it's dry or fatty or lacking in flavor. Not Black Dog. I've never had bad brisket here. I've never had bad ANYTHING here.The sides are just stunning. I had a recurring problem with underdone smoked sweet potatoes but no one else had this problem. I must be cursed. When they're fully done, they're delicious, just check them before you leave if you get takeout. The fries and sweet potato fries are crisp and delicious. In about 20 orders, we've never had soggy or greasy fries. The potato casserole is okay but it's a bit bland. Their homemade smoked bleu cheese dressing is also fabulous. And I'd consider composing an ode to their cornbread.They also did theme nights, where they'd put on special dinners. There was a night with local meats from Triple S Farms, a beer night, and a Thanksgiving dinner. All delicious. Notice a theme, here? I miss you guys!

<Content> Hands down - best barbeque place (and best restaurant, in my opinion) in the Champaign/Urbana area! I've tried almost everything on the menu, and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the spare ribs with a smoked sweet potato.There's usually a really long wait to be seated if you go during dinner hours (6-9pm), but if you are willing to sit at the bar, its not too bad. Well worth it!

<Content> I'm not even much of a BBQ fan, but this place is excellent! By far the best place for for barbecue in the CU. Loved the pulled pork, burnt ends, even the fries were great! The potato casserole is amazing. Good beer selection. Fun, casual bar atmosphere and the food comes out on metal pans :)Get here early, because it's a small space and fills up quick. There is usually quite a line, sometimes out the door. It's worth it!

<Content> Okay, so we read reviews of this joint rating the BBQ excellent, best ever, I died and went to heaven, ranked #2 in the US by Fox-something for BBQ and decided to venture off our course from St. Louis to Indy to visit Urbana IL and this incredible place to eat. Correctly reviewed, there was a wait at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening. We signed in on the board as soon as we arrived (again, thanks to a review) - good to know this or we would have been standing around outside in the brisk weather until we happened to figure it out. We waited about a half hour and were seated at the bar. Service was okay, not stellar. So we ordered the "burnt ends". I'm not sure what we should have expected, but two fatty slices of brisket were not to my liking. If you like fatty prime rib, then you will be in heaven. The rib tips had a good flavor, were a bit on the tough side for me, hubby enjoys chewing so he didn't mind them. The sauces were just okay, hubby didn't like any we tried and we were charged extra for each sauce. The cornbread was good. Overall, this a good BBQ place, not the best we have eaten, not the worst we have eaten. Not a place for cheap beer - one draft cost $6.00. We have a much better BBQ join in Indianapolis - if you ever drive thru, try Squealers.

<Content> Black Dog is, hands down, my favorite restaurant is Champaign Urbana. I first visited when it opened and have been back many many times, bringing new people with me each time and converting them into Black Dog lovers just like me. The BBQ here is fantastic (declared by a St. Louis girl)! Whatever you do, you must order their Burnt Ends, either in Sandwich form or as an appetizer. The pulled pork sandwich and ribs are also great choices, but nothing beats their Burnt Ends. Another great appetizer is the Texas Caviar, a delicious salsa made with black eyed peas and hominy. As far as bbq sauce goes, my personal favorite is the Hot Georgia Peach. It's the perfect mix of a spicy bbq sauce and the sweetness of the regular Georgia Peach sauce. And the sweet potato fries...oh, the sweet potato fries. What I wouldn't give to have some right now. I'm not even going to tell you how good they are, you just need to have some for yourself.This place also has a great beer selection and the servers are friendly and obliging in offering out recommendations. My friends and I all agree that this place reminds you of a neighborhood bar that you would find in Chicago. A nice change of pace from all the typical campus bars in CU. Some tips on dining here: it gets packed and fast! Part of Black Dog's charm is that it's a small bar. Unfortunately, that means limited seating. If you want to get a seat before the rush, try to get there before noon for lunch (they open at 11am), or before 5:30 for dinner. If you happen to find a long line when you get there. Don't leave!! Stick it out! It's worth it.

<Content> We had been holding out going here for a long time because I don't eat meat and I had heard that the only non meat item on the menu was a grilled cheese! Well was I ever wrong! The menu offers quite a few items for non meat eaters, a smoked catfish, salmon (on Friday and Saturday) a falafel plate AND a grilled cheese! My son and husband started off with wings and then moved on to the burnt end sandwiches, one choosing potato salad the other choosing fries and i had the smoked catfish. Always health conscious I had to ensure that the items were not fried and the extremely friendly and helpful waitress assured me, no they were only smoked. All I can say is WE ARE CONVERTS!!!! No other barbeque places for us anymore. My husband and son agreed that 10 out of 10 times they would get the burnt ends sandwich(one note to others-this does run out). As for my catfish? Delicious, mouth watering, healthy and left me wanting to come back often-thanks Black Dog for offering outstanding BBQ for us all!!!!!

<Content> Best. Place. Ever. Chicken wings taste like they were cooked over a campfire, after eating them my hands smell good for hours. Sweet potato fries are probably the best I've ever had.Last time I went, they had a smoked portobella mushroom sandwich which is nice because before the only vegetarian option was grilled cheese (and the aforementioned sweet potato fries, and a couple other sides.)Large beer menu - not a perk for me since I don't drink beer- but my friends love it.Over all, fantastic place. oh and awesome service too. Always have been overly friendly. Wonderful!!!

<Content> I finally was able to eat at the Black Dog, and I am still trying to understand the hype. Possibly people in Urbana don't experience good BBQ, but I grew up eating delicious food and this was just ok. The seating options were limited and the wait was long. The waitress was busy but not as attentive as I hoped. It took a while to get something to drink, but I understood that it was packed and she was busy, so I'll give her a break. I ordered the combo: ribs and catfish with the Carolina house sauce on the side. The plate arrives with small portions and a side of the worst sauce I have ever tasted. The way the food is cooked must be particular to a certain region because it is not like the Memphis, Kentucky and Texas style I grew up eating. It was full of vinegar, spicy and nasty. The meat was tender, which it should be because it was smoked for 4 1/2 hours, and I wouldn't have expected anything less. After eating here, I wasn't impressed. So many people have talked about how great the food was, and I should have known better. The food was okay, and I must say I've had better barbecue in my own backyard.

A couple of our friends stopped by briefly to say hello and he tried to be a bouncer and kick them out. Unacceptable. It's a shame when people in the service industry lack manners.

<Content> After a few years, I'm sorry to downgrade my initial 5-star review. Here are the reasons:1. The prices have increased substantially in the last few years. It's no longer a great value. If you buy a sandwich, side, and a drink, you're spending around $13 (counting tax and tip). Yeah, I get that some of their meat is coming from local farms and stuff and it's more expensive as a result. I really don't care. The use of local animals has priced me out of the restaurant. 2. The wait times are completely unacceptable. Unless you eat between 2-4pm, you can count on a wait of around 30-45 minutes. It's okay if you want this to be your major activity of the night, but sadly, it's no longer a place where you can stop in for a quick and inexpensive BBQ sandwich. The mix of inconvenience and increased cost has led me to downgrade my review of what was formerly one of my favorite restaurants. Also, I'm not nearly as impressed with the quality of the food after trying Smoque BBQ in Chicago. Previously, I thought that Black Dog was amongst the best BBQ in the nation, but as good as it is, there is no comparison to Smoque when it comes to the meat.

<Content> I enjoyed my trip to this restaurant. We got there and have a new baby. The man at the door got us in ahead of a few others. We did crammed back in a corner but that was ok, we thought. I was excited when I looked at their menu because they had burnt ends. This is a special extra smoked point of the brisket. They smoke the whole thing 12 hours, trim the point, then dry rub the point and resmoke it 12 hours. This cut was in very limited supply so I wanted to get there early. Luckily we got there in time. I ordered the burnt end sandwich which was topped with vinegar based cole slaw with some purple cabbage in there and their signature vinegar red barbecue  sauce. Smoky, spicy, and tart. As my side I choose the sweet potato fries, which were highly recommended here on yelp. The fries were nice and crisp but seemed like I got the end of a batch because they were all small, short fries. Another great thing about The Black Dog is it has a tremendous beer selection. I had an Avery Maharaja Imperial IPA. Extremely hopped and sitting nice at 10%. The food was great but what have them a 3 star rating was when the air kicked on. Once this happened, dust was flying every where. It was all over my shirt and the table. I am sure I ate some but I could not give up this fine meal. Seems as if a spring cleaning was in order. I would go back to Urbana just to try this again. Next time I hope to give it 5 stars.

<Content> Best bbq I know of. Moved to St. Louis 2 years ago but went to Black Dog many times before I left, and saw their menu and product evolve.  I continue to take meat and sauce home to this day when in the area. If anything, they have created a monster, with waits (sometimes lengthy) at any meal time. Go off-hours if you can. I find their burnt ends, pork belly, chicken wing starters, beef brisket, and Carolina and Texas sauces some of the best things I have had at any bbq joint. Given the crowds, service is good, but it can get hectic. Not a place to linger and talk unless you get there at an off-time. This space itself is pleasant with warm colors, and flatscreens have games going all the time. Probably best bbq between the Chicago area and perhaps Murphysboro (17th St. Bar and Grill), some 5 hours south. Warning - not sure who owns the parking lot to the north of the building, but it is in AWFUL shape. Beware.

<Content> Amazing barbeque. Like most people, I love the burnt ends. The blue cheese burger is also amazing. The Texas caviar is a favorite side. They are one of the few places in town with absinthe behind the bar (Seven Saints is the only other one I'm aware of), and they make a delicious sazerac cocktail. The staff is nice. Steve up front can seem a little on the serious side, but I would be too if I was trying to manage the crowd of people who pack in that little area.

The best thing was that the ingredients are fairly high quality, they try to use local meat when they can and their sauces are delicious.

<Content> Maybe I just over-hyped this place in my mind, but I felt sort of let down after eating at Black Dog. I had the beef brisket sandwich and the double baked potato side--both good, but definitely not great. I came here at 1 PM on a Wednesday and missed out on the "burnt ends", so a chance to try those may bring me back to give this place another shot. That said, it's a good place to grab a quick, cheap lunch--definitely a nice change of pace from any chain restaurant. Oh, and they only had one bartender serving a packed bar, so the service was somewhat lacking.

<Content> Tonight was our first visit to the Black Dog. We had the rib platter with two sides. The ribs were extremely tasty and tender but a little light on the meat side. The twice baked potatoes were outstanding and sweet potato fries were also very tasty. We also had a side of the chicken wings. They were the very very best wings, perfectly done tender and just the right spice. With the sauces that come are not required on the meats. The sauces add a lot of extra flavor. I will definitely be back here in another month when I return.

I have eaten here more times than I can count and I have had almost everything on the menu, and I have NEVER had something I didn't like. I always get the wings as an appetizer and they are amazing! my favorite thing on the menu is the cuban sandwich which you can only get on Wednesdays but I seriously live for them. The only thing that sucks is the seating, there is always a wait but this place is worth waiting for :)

<Content> This place was packed, line out of the door, but the staff were very efficient, fair, composed, and super nice as they managed the ever-growing crowd. Very good Nosferatu beer on tap along with great pulled pork and sides. Fries had an unusually delicious flavor - not sure if that was the potato or the oil. Our waiter was terrific.  Rolls of paper towels on every table. The only thing I'd suggest is that BBQ sauces are available at tables/booths or they are described in detail - the basic sauce they offered me was too spicy for my liking when it comes to pulled pork. I don't know how many other sauces they had on hand or what they were like, but I would have liked to experiment at the table.

<Content> Black Dog is a new favorite. I've had their chicken, pork, and brisket sandwiches plus their catfish. Pulled pork is my favorite sandwich. Love the Carolina sauce and the crunch from the slaw is outstanding. And you can't beat the burnt ends. They literally melt in your mouth. Sweet potato fries are a solid side but pit beans are the best. Great selection of beers. This is not a very big place and I regularly have to wait for a table, but it's well worth it.

<Content> Without a doubt their food is fantastic. Every time I've been here I have been very satisfied with the quality of food and selection of beers. I've had a variety of dishes and sides and they deserve the rating of top restaurant in Champaign!Their service on the other hand...is a different story. Perhaps they can get away with this because of the high quality food but there should be a limit to how poorly they treat customers. Examples of this include being put on hold for 5 minutes when calling for take out, hanging up and then calling back to immediately have my order taken but no apology. When dining in, I don't mind the long wait for a table but when I am seated, I have not even had a server come to my table for 10 or 15 minutes. Again, great food but don't expect great service!

<Content> We drove an hour and a half to eat here one last time before moving out east. This place keeps getting busier. Good, he should expand! Minus one star for always running out of food. I know, it's typical of smokehouses, but still... I always request to get the Georgia Peach bbq sauce, I could seriously drink that stuff. No other smokehouse I've been to has ever had a sauce I find even remotely as delicious. I also love the cornbread. To drink, I get the jalapeno pineapple margarita, it's a very good combination of flavors. I love that they serve the food on metal trays too.

<Content> I have yet to eat something here I don't like. Ask anyone who knows me, I am picky and this is the ONLY place I have been that I like everything I have ordered. I cannot say enough good things about this place. I guess the only negative is everytime I go in there is around a 30min wait for a table, but it is worth it, and I think they need a kids menu. I am moving to the St.Louis area and I am going to miss this place! I am going to have to find excuses to come up!

I had the burnt ends BBQ sandwich + twice baked potatoes + Sioux City Ginger Beer (non-alcoholic) which was a great combination.  If you're up for BBQ sauce that's thick, spicy + sweet this is the place for you!

<Content> The Black Dog has great food, great beer, and a great atmosphere. Unfortunately, everyone in town is in on the secret. Do not go here if you are in a hurry or looking for a quiet place to take your date.  Go here only if you are willing to sacrifice a little convenience in order to gorge yourself on some of the best food in town.  There doesn't seem to be a weak spot on the Black Dog's menu. As other people have mentioned, the pulled pork is exceptional, but right now I'm hung up on the free-range Amish chicken. Whether you get it as a breast or as a thigh and a wing, you won't be disappointed. It is moist, succulent, and pairs well with their homemade sauce.    In my experience, the service is pretty good given the circumstances. Yes, you will have to wait fifteen minutes to a half hour to get a seat, but eventually your turn will come. Moreover, since it's a barbecue joint, it doesn't take too long for your food to come after that. The restaurant would probably benefit from an expansion or a move to a larger location, but for food this good, I'm willing to brave a short wait for the time being.

<Content> Their barbeque is the best in town. Everything they make is freshly made from scratch, even the tasty lemonade. In addition to the barbeque, I like the potato casserole and the corn bread with pork inside. I usually order my food to go since it is a popular restaurant and if you plan to eat there at dinner time, you will have to wait a very long time.

My husband had the brisket, I had pulled pork, our son had burned ends and his girl had jumbalya. Everything was perfect. This is a small place, so don't expect to sit right down. They also have some great brews and full bar. I would absolutely go again!

<Content> On BBQ alone, just the meat, I think Lil Porgy's is just as good, but certain things make this better in my mind:-Side dishes are far superior-They serve beer-Burnt ends, when you can get themThe really big downside is that the space is tiny, making the wait extremely long. They will do takeout if you call in, I highly recommend this option.

<Content> Yes! Finally went to Black Dog. Since I moved to Champaign I have been constantly hearing about this place and I was dying to go. We ordered the cornbread because I was told to try it, but I wasn't a huge fan. It was good, just not for me. I love pulled pork so, naturally, that's what I ordered. I wanted to try two sides so I got the platter. I had the slaw and the potato salad, both of which were awesome. The pulled pork was delicious, and the sauce they give you was beyond good. I also tried a bite of my friend's cuban sandwich, and it was also delicious. The service was also decent, and the restaurant is pretty nice overall. The only thing I can see being a problem is the size of it. It is definitely a small place and apparently they get a pretty long line at certain times. We went on a Wednesday afternoon and got a table right away though. Can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu!BASICALLY JUST GO. GO NOW.

Also after 5 pm they have a smoked sweet potato. Also they have a great rotating tap list so check them out throughout the year.

<Content> We visited Black Dog tonight for the first time and now have a new favorite BBQ restaurant. My husband got the rib tips and I had burnt ends and pulled pork. They were all amazing. We also had the cornbread...so, so good. I had potato salad and pit beans for my sides and the smoke flavor of the beans was seriously out of this world. I really could imagine myself sitting out at my grandma's farm during our yearly family cookout, which might sound cheesy but it was that good. We both had the house sauce, which was good but I will probably try something a bit milder next time. The staff was VERY friendly. I felt like I was just hanging out with my friends at a bar that happened to have incredible BBQ too. Everything was outstanding and although we got there early enough that we didn't have to wait, we would have been more than happy to.

<Content> A group of four of us visiting the U of IL did some light research and chose Black Dog for dinner. Another colleague who was local to the area told us that Urbana was "dead" and we should go somewhere else. We ignored the advice and boy were we glad we did!It was a Monday about 6pm and we had roughly a 5 minute wait. The guy who seated us was a little surly but we didn't have to interact with him much. Our server however, was great fun. We had the beer flight which was great and then each of us had a sandwich - 2 pulled pork and 2 burnt ends - and then the sweet potato fries. Sandwiches came with sauce and coleslaw on the sandwich and they were phenomenal. Price was amazingly low and terrific value for the dollar.

<Content> I absolutely love the food specials and drinks, with daily specials and lots of homemade goodness, you'll definitely love this little bbq joint! The Pineapple or Raspberry/Pepper margaritas are so refreshing, peppery, and boozy. If you want to try a variety of different bbq meats, get the combo meals, choice of two meats and two sides. The local chicken is to die for, smokey and tender, in fact, I'd say it's the theme for all the bbq'd meats there! Black Dog offers different house made sauces too...the peach is really good, sweet, and spicy! You need to get there early for lunch/dinner; popular items can run out pretty quickly. Great prices, portions, and always a line out the door, Black Dog is a must to check out.

<Content> I am not a HUGE fan of smoked foods. Most of my experiences with smoked meats ended up leaving an "ash-tray" taste in the mouth, or really dry meat. But at Black Dog, I LOVED IT. My husband cleared his plate faster then I have ever seen - and said straight away that his food was the BEST smoked pulled pork he had ever had. I had the beef brisket, and damn, it was good. Can't beat the price tag, I mean, really? If I remember correctly, our bill was less then $15!

<Content> I had a full rack of ribs with slaw and sweet potato fries as my sides. The ribs were some of the best dry rub ribs I've had: very tender, smokey and meaty. I could not finish a full rack. The fries were on par with any other sweet potato fries I've had anywhere, but the portion size was relatively small and the fries themselves were on the cool side like they'd been cooked and reheated. The slaw was not to my liking. The cabbage was cut too thick, chewy and bitter. And while the sauce was a pretty tasty vinegar base, it did nothing to transform the cabbage. The sauce just ran to the bottom of the bowl. I would definitely recommend this place if just for the ribs. Our party of 4 waited about an hour to get in, but the servers were attentive and good at handling large crowds. I would have given Black Dog 5 stars if the slaw and fries were better. Overall, I love the feel of the place and appreciate a small business that does things well.

<Content> Best place to eat in C-U, in my opinion. Not too expensive, either, given the quality of the BBQ you're getting. I haven't had anything that wasn't good there, so you really can't go wrong. Beer selection is excellent as well, which is a nice bonus.That said, the quality is a little variable. Some nights it's just good but then other nights it's drop dead amazing. On top of that, it's impossible on virtually any night of the week so get there early (5:30 or so) or expect to wait a long time. It's still worth it and you can't begrudge them their success, they deserve.Always ask if they still have burnt ends... and I vastly prefer their hot Georgia Peach sauce to the standard sauce.

<Content> My girlfriend and I ad the opportunity to stop in the Black Dog on a Sunday afternoon and after a 15 minute wait, was seated at two seats near the back by a server stand. We ordered two of the sampler platters so got a good range of entree's and sides. The food was excellent, the chicken (white meat) was tender and the catfish was smoked through wonderfully. I was not a huge fan of the cornbread, but it was different and I would not hesitate to order it as an appetizer. I also had the beer sampler and there was a nice range of beer to compliment the food. Waitress was friendly and service was fast but we never felt rushed at all. I will definitely stop in next time i'm in town.

<Content> Awful service, great food.Those words basically sum up this place. Because of the food, black dogs is always packed. You don't want to eat in usually because the service is non-existent. They will give u the food and never come back. I actually had a waitress that was eating in the back, but we were done eating and wanted the check. After calling her up, she had to take another bite and casually take her time giving us dirty checks. It is unacceptable!After having a great meal, the terrible service just ruined it.So I should probably give 2 scores.Service: 0/5Food: 5/5I recommend take out only.

<Content> I went to Black Dog on a recent visit to C-U. Based on the reviews here, I was expecting a long wait, but got lucky and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table (I'm sure the miserable weather had something to do with that). I can be a touch critic when it comes to BBQ - having spent years living in the southeast and in Texas, I'm familiar with both BBQ traditions. Since everything looked so good, I had to get a combination plate. My ribs were just so-so - I got the small end, and the meat had gotten pretty dried out, and were perhaps a tad over-seasoned. They did have a decent smoke flavor though, and I imagine that if I had gotten the larger pieces I would have liked them significantly better. The brisket (my usual favorite) was not particularly good - it was so lean that it had become dry and tough. However, the burnt ends really stole the show. In case you aren't familiar, they are chunks of the brisket point (not really "burnt", but they spend some extra time in the smoker giving more smoke flavor, and they don't get overly dry because of their higher fat content). They had great flavor, with an ideal, tender-but-not-too-tender texture. My sides were good - surprisingly good fries (skinny cut with a seasoned surface) and apples (a nice complement to BBQ that doubles as a dessert). None of the sauces stood out to me, but it was nice that they had a variety. If you want to try extra, you can get "half-and-half" if you ask - smaller portions of two different sauces - otherwise, they do charge extra. It is a little on the pricey side for BBQ, but given the relative lack of quality options in C-U (and the fact that they're always so busy), I can't fault them for that too much.

We had the burnt tips for an appetizer and I was very impressed with the flavor and the tenderness. I ordered the brisket with their version of Texas bbq sauce and thoroughly enjoyed it. Great smoke ring and flavor with a good portion size. SO ordered the combo plate of a half slab of spareribs and catfish. The ribs were seasoned well with a sweet dry rub which is how my SO prefers them. They were cooked to perfection, tender but not overdone and I got a good crisp bite off the bone. I didn't care for the catfish as it was smoked however the hubby enjoyed it. I liked the bbq sauces we had (Texas and sweet Georgia peach) however did not care for the house bbq sauce. The side dishes are okay. I had the Southwest potato salad and it was a different take on traditional potato salad. Atmosphere was great and the servers were friendly and knowledgeable. I do wish they had more room inside the restaurant however I hear they're opening a second location with more square footage. Definitely pleased and would have this add a go-to spot to take visitors for bbq.

<Content> My favorite Champaign-Urbana restaurant! I've had lots of great barbecue but nothing holds a candle to my Black Dog. Really great atmosphere, good selection of craft beer, and good lord, the food. Count on waiting 15-20 minutes for a table, but it will be so worth your wait!

<Content> I mean BEST bbq in the world... and I have eaten a lot of bbq in my day. You have to wait to be seated and the place is always jammed. No reservations friends but I'll tell ya it's always worth the wait. Can't wait you say... too hungry? Okay then call in your order and pick it up. Black dog tastes just as good on your couch. Also little pearl of wisdom here... in a bind for Dad's weekend and don't want to fight the crowds? Or for graduation? Black dog caters (sort of). Just call ahead and order what ever you need. Then skip all the waiting and drive up to the back door at which point they will load pounds of meat and yummy yummy food into your car. Best decision I ever made for Dad's weekend was ordering food from Black dog.

<Content> New to town and am less than impressed. The food is good but the service leaves alot to be desired. Long long wait. Have been there twice and both times expierenced nothing but attitude from all the servers. Especially if you have questions about the menu! Wait, attitude of employees and lack of space takes away from the quality of the food. I wont be back.

<Content> I went to Black Dog for lunch after hearing many good reviews from my friends who have been frequenting this BBQ smokehouse. I did not really look over the menu because I knew what I wanted before going: the Thursday special, the BBQ burrito. I placed my order and within five minutes my lunch was placed before me. Added into the burrito was pico de gallo, house salsa, cheese, saute'd poblano peppers and smoked turkey. It was an interesting combination; not quite mexican, but not quite pure BBQ. It was filled with flavor. The only issue I had with this dish was how much juice/grease was inside my burrito. It ended up falling apart, but luckily the lunch came prepared with a fork and knife to clean up the scrapes. Based off of this dish, I am sure a pure BBQ dish would be quite delicious, but I am going to reserve a 5 star review until I can try it out. As a summary, the service was nice and quick, I was a fan of the atmosphere, and the food left me wanting more.

<Content> One of my top three c/u restaurants. I admit I am not a BBQ connoisseur. I am only familiar with Memphis BBQ, but the last time I was in Memphis, I was wishing I was at Black Dog. I used to be crazy about their cole slaw, but in the past year or two the recipe seems to have changed. I will still get it on a sandwich, but not as a side also. The first time I went here was a friday night in Nov 2008 and I think there were three occupied tables in the whole place. Now, you should definitely plan on a wait for pretty much any night of the week. That is frustrating if you show up hungry but it's also part of the charm and quaintness of the restaurant. Lunch time is not quite as busy, but still busy during lunch rush. I appreciate the addition of a couple veggie options on the menu (portabello sandwich and grilled cheese). Great addition to the area and excited to hear they are opening another location. Since I've moved out of town I really miss this place :(

<Content> There is a reason there is so much hype on here about this place - because it is wonderful! I had the catfish sandwich and my husband had the burnt ends. Both were so amazing we barely talked the entire meal. The couple next to us ordered the ribs and they looked incredible - so much meat! Our friends went and said the pulled pork and sweet potato fries are great. We'd love to try everything on their menu eventually :)

<Content> WOWZA! I'm not from CU, but I've been coming here every summer since I was a kid. My grandparents usually take us somewhere fancy, but I'd rather eat here anytime! We had fantastic BBQ & service! Since there was a 45 minute wait when we arrived and my grandparents are over 90, the host told us we should walk over to the bar across the street for drinks and he came all the way over there to let us know our table was ready!! Now THAT's service!  Also, I'm from GA and the BBQ here is better than most I've had back home, and that's sayin somethin!

<Content> DELICIOUS!!! We waited about 40 minutes for table of 3, but no big deal as you can have a beer, or two, and the people watching is great! We ordered the cornbread as an appetizer. Pure heaven. Buttery, sweet, smoky. The brisket is so good, very tender and a great smoky taste. The sauce is very flavorful, made me sweat! If you like a sauce that is thick and sweet (like a sweet baby ray's, for example), this is not it. Black Dog's is much better! The sweet potato fries are nice and crispy, sweet/salty, and you get a nice portion of them. The slaw is a vinegar slaw, not a creamy mayo slaw, so keep that in mind. We got there around 6:00 pm and they were already out of the burnt ends, so not sure how early you have to get there to order them. I'm not sure why some on here seem to be uptight about the service. These people ARE WORKING THEIR BUTTS OFF!! Have you seen how crazy busy they are?  Plain and simple, GO HERE. EAT. DRINK. YOU WILL BE HAPPY.

<Content> In my experience at the Dog the B.B.Q. the ribs, tips, at least are really hit or miss, I've had real good and I have had some of the worst ribs and tips I have paid for. Over cooked, dry, tough just bad. I waited 30 to 40 min. to get bad food ? They have very good sauces. The wait is always long even for to go I have stood there packed in the entrance for 35mins. for two sandwiches, rib tips, and two potatos. Burnt end are very good I was lucky enough to get them once, but never again. I went one day and got right in only two or three people there, lucky day right? No they where out of food.Is it not on the first page of restaurants for dummies to make money and have customers you need to have food? This place is out of control, to bad if done right it could be great.So for now I've given up one this one. We will soon have the B.B.Q. triangle The Black Dog, LI'L Porgy's, and Po Boys when they move into the neighbourhood later this year. Lets see what happens.

There was a 15 or 20 minute wait, due to the deserving popularity of the place. While its not a cheap place, for the quality of food the value is outstanding.

<Content> I am currently sitting in one of the top rated barbecue restaurants in Chicago, which shall remain nameless to protect their own dignity, staring at their wall of commendations from Time Out Chicago, the Chicago Reader, and Michelin, among others, with a plate of steaming hot pulled pork in front of me. However, after the first bite I can't help but wish I was scraping the bone of a Black Dog rib drizzled ever so sparingly with the Texas BBQ sauce, or savoring another bite of the always delicious potato salad. Mike, Pedro and the crew have truly created something special, a place that transcends the food it serves. Black Dog isn't just a restaurant, it's a state of being, a place that people are eager to take others for their very first time simply to try and relive the joy of their own first experience. Whether I'm salivating over the smokey charred brisket, or jonesing for one of the hand selected craft beers on tap, Black Dog will always maintain a special place in my heart, one that every future smoked meat establishment will fruitlessly attempt to replicate. I will be back to Black Dog one day, but until then I will have my memories of Black Dog stuck like proverbial rib meat between the teeth of my epicurean reveries.

<Content> Undoubtedly the best BBQ food in the CU. It's almost silly to give this place another 5 star review because pretty much everyone knows its awesome. Come early so that you can get Burndt Ends, which always sell out. They make them twice a day, once for lunch and once for dinner. Don't come during peak hours because you'll probably wait 45mins for a table.

<Content> This is one of the (not so hidden) gems of C-U. They have excellent barbeque, not some nasty rib bones slathered in sauce, this is real thing. I highly recommend the pulled pork and the burnt ends, and the sweet potato fries are a must. The prices can't be beat, you can get a BBQ sandwich and fries for $7 at lunch or dinner. Just be warned, this place is really popular and the seating area isn't large, so it gets crowded and you might have a hard time getting a seat if you don't arrive early.

I have only tried a few sauces (Carolina and Georgia Peach) and they are awesome. I get the wings every time I come here. I have tried the pulled pork, catfish sandwich and even a burger. The food is always great. I just really wish I could sit down and enjoy lunch here without a ridiculously long wait.

<Content> I'm a big fan of the food here. The meat is tender and flavorful. I usually go for the pulled pork, but the ribs are excellent as well. The sauce is tangy with a bit of a kick, not a sweet bbq sauce. They usually don't put enough on in my opinion, so ask for extra. The ribs have a dry rub that make a nice crust and the meat inside is extremely tender and juicy. Their twice baked potato casserole is delish, but I think the sweet potato fries need a lot more seasoning. The cornbread is different, a little smokey and actually has bits of pork in it, but it was great. The only reasons I don't give them 5 stars are 1) they are usually out of at least one thing (maybe that's part of the allure??) 2) it's really small and crowded all the time and 3) I've found the service to be rude. They make me feel like it's a hassle for them to bring me my food and take my money. Oh well, the food makes it worth it!

<Content> Why oh why couldn't this place stay a bigger secret? Everything is delicious, but they really excel at smoking pork. The pulled pork is great on its own or in a sandwich, and the pork belly is heaven if your arteries can handle more than one bite :). Unfortunately, they're very crowded a lot of the time and it can get quite noisy inside. But with food as good as theirs, I'll keep coming back. Their house BBQ sauce isn't sickly sweet like some other area establishments', but instead is slightly spicy with a vinegar kick (but if you're with silly folks like my hubs who like a sweeter sauce, don't worry, they've got that too). Delightful. Try the smoked sweet potato after 5pm for a special side, it's one of my favorites (and makes especially good take-home leftovers if you are too full after devouring your meats). Oh, and if you're like me and were used to mixed drinks that come all tricked out with umbrellas and slushy neon coloring, sit down before you order one of theirs. Their margaritas are delicious, not at all watered-down, and served in a plain old glass. Knock your socks off yummy and strong. Their selection of beer is also excellent.

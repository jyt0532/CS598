<Content> We came in for a nice family dinner this past Saturday. It was absolutely delicious. The prices are very fair too.I had an amazing BLT. It was perfect. Everyone else enjoyed their food, the menu is rather small, but everything is good! I think between the 9 of us, we tried everything on the menu.The salad bar is nice, everything looked fresh.The service is great, everyone is friendly.But...the high light of the meal, was DESSERT. This is not a place to skip dessert. I don't care if you are counting calories, today is the day to cheat on that diet!! The apple dumplings, are just amazing. I don't usually go for desserts, figured I'd have a bite or two of my husbands though. Well, a bite or two turned into me eating at least half of his apple dumpling, even though I was full already! It is that good. I want the recipe!

<Content> Apple Dumpling is about 10-15 minutes outside C-U proper, on the wild edges of town, and it's a plain, unassuming little spot. It will serve you the friendliest of calorie-laden, heart-attack inducing greasy breakfasty diner foods and the like, and for that you must love it a little bit. The country kitsch works here, and is worth a stop in. I really did enjoy their biscuits and gravy for breakfast, which are filled with carbs and fat and love and all that one can ask for in Middle America.Their Sunday buffet is a little disappointing as it lacks any breakfast options, but the fried chicken is spot on. It's worth coming once for the kitsch, twice for the biscuits and gravy. Then you go to the gym and cry salty, buttery tears on your treadmill.

<Content> Probably the best place in the area to get a taste of what people were eating in central Illinois 50 years ago. The beef and noodles (all you can eat on Thursday) are exactly like what my great grandma used to make us, and the biscuits and gravy always take me back to mornings before fishing. Be warned-the Apple Dumpling doesn't pull its punches. The food is not healthy-it was designed for farm laborers, not office dwellers (or tractor riders), and is consequently heavy, hearty, and massively caloric. You might think that some of the noodles are underdone. You are wrong. The noodles are made to different thicknesses on purpose, and some of them need to have more texture. If nothing else, think of it as proof that a person made your food, not a factory.Here's the skinny (irony!). If you grew up in the midwest, you'll know what's going on with one bite. If you're from some other place, give it a taste and expand your horizons, but check your baggage at the door. Like it or not, you'll leave a more cultured person.

<Content> It's fairly difficult to find Apple Dumpling, so if you're willing to:1) make the trek to far away Urbana,2) be stared at for your entire meal if you happen to not be Caucasian,3) subject your arteries to a deluge of fat, and4) eat in a large cafeteria-like room with the glaring white walls of a hospital,then this place is for you.The homemade apple dumplings are quite good actually. The beef and noodles (with LOTS of mashed potatoes) was great, but it got a little overwhelming after a couple large bites...I think my body was rejecting the sudden influx of calories.

<Content> The Apple Dumpling claims to hold the world record for most Apple Dumplings served. Well - maybe not - but they have served like 200,000 - and that says a lot considering that this restaurant is literally in the country - on a highway - not near any major exit from an interstate.Best Fried Chicken in town. Period!

<Content> Emphasis on the family restaurant, with family (whose?) photos on the walls. Open, clean, bright ambiance. Servers were efficient and friendly. The breakfast menu was limited and not very appealing. The coffee was okay. I ordered the Giant Cinnamon Roll but was told they were out. This was at 9:00 AM. How do you run out with two hours left of breakfast?  I then ordered the Loaded Omelet. It was, indeed, loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, veggies, and cheese. It needed some seasoning and a bit more flavor but wasn't that bad. On the side was fried potatoes and gravy. It was good, but my doctor would kill me if she saw me eating that. Definite artery clogger. In all it wasn't bad but also not someplace I'd return, even to taste the elusive cinnamon roll. NOTE: There are references in the other reviews that hint at prejudice, such as "be stared at for your entire meal if you happen to not be Caucasian."  While I was there, a black couple came in and seemed to be known by the staff and was greeted warmly. An interracial couple later came in. I saw no "staring" or any such behavior.

<Content> This place is figuratively and nearly literally a million miles from the rest of the dining choices in CU and a great change of pace for those looking for good, down home food prepared in a traditional way. The menu is limited, and specials change from day to day, but you can expect to find fried chicken, pork tenderloin, meatloaf, Salisbury steak, and beef Stroganoff, pot roast and other Midwestern standards. Mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans, and corn accompany. They have excellent rolls and serve them with a squeeze dispenser of apple butter, making them ridiculously addicting.The eponymous and enormous apple dumplings are divine. Save room, you will not regret it. They are essentially cored apples, stuffed in cinnamony goodness, wrapped in flaky pie crust and baked. They are worth a trip in and of themselves.The decor seems a bit odd, but is well-suited to the restaurant. Country effects and pictures of family worthy of awkwardfamilyphotos.com adorn the walls. The walls are light, and the fluorescent lights are bright. Do not expect an intimate or quiet meal, but this works as this is primarily a breakfast and lunch joint (traditionally, farm families eat the biggest meal of the day at noon, and call it dinner, with supper in the early evening). The dining area can be crowded and loud, and there is a huge open entryway into the kitchen, so the curious can literally monitor everything that goes on in the restaurant. All this fits, however, as this is restaurant's honesty is bared for all to see and what is revealed is pure.What separates the Apple Dumpling from other restaurants is not just the menu items and decor, it is the sense of family. Servers, cooks, and other staff are clearly all from the same extended family and/or social group (probably the church across the street). If you happen to be of Midwestern stock they will serve you food that is exactly like what your mother and grandmother made, and that is a big compliment in my book.5 stars for the food, minus 1 star for a complete dearth of vegetarian and/or healthy options (other than a half-assed salad bar), a smallish parking lot, and limited hours of operation, minus another for no alcohol, but plus a star for the great prices.

<Content> Just what I needed today - a place removed enough from CU that I could forget about reality for awhile. Maybe 15 tables in the whole place, country cooking, and a quaint atmosphere. Just north of Aldi and Wal-Mart in Urbana.Pork tenderloins were perfectly cooked. Minus one star for a combination of trivial factors: 1) 35 minutes for a take-out order at 2pm; 2) regardless of describing the sandwiches as coming with lettuce, onion, and pickle, the loins were bare on tiny buns; and 3) chips, not fries for a $4.40 sandwich.Enough menu items that you have a small choice, but not so many as you will want more than one thing. The menu boasts fried chicken, country fried steak, mashed potatoes, and the like. $5-8 for lunch or dinner. ... Undecided on the employees' denim overalls and bright red t-shirts...

<Content> Pros: Great homemade food at a great priceCons: LocationMy Advice: Go on a Friday or Saturday night, when you can get a Twice-Baked PotatoI have been living in the C-U area for a little over 2 years now and I made my first visit to The Apple Dumplin' just 3 nights ago. We absolutely loved it! Enough so that we went again last night. Their twice-baked potato was fantastic, one of the best potatoes I've ever eaten. The only bad thing it that they only serve it on Friday and Saturday nights, so if you go any other time, you're SOL. On our first visit, my son, my step-daughter-to-be and I all got beef and noodles. The children's version is served with mashed potatoes on the side, while the full-size meal is served over a bed of mashed potatoes. It was delicious and also very filling. Even though it was the nightly all-you-can-eat meal, I was only able to eat one plate. My fiance ordered fried chicken and it was very good. Lightly breaded and juicy, just the way fried chicken should be. On our second visit I got the all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp, the Saturday night special. Paired with the twice-baked potato, my meal was excellent. This was no tiny, marble sized shrimp; they were plump and perfectly fried. Not to mention, all-you-can-eat shrimp for only $8.75? Are you kidding me? My fiance got the beef and noodles, which was just as tasty as the first time. The kids got chicken strips and fries, which were just what you would expect, but the portions were huge. The staff is very friendly and they remembered us from the first time we were there. Our waitress even commented that my son had gotten a haircut in between. The salad bar is nothing super special, but it's adequate. I loved the cucumber salad and the kidney bean salad. Almost everything made here is done so from scratch. I don't know if the popcorn shrimp was, but the beef and noodles, fried chicken and mashed potatoes definitely were. According to the menu we brought home, they peel about one ton of potatoes a week. The homemade rolls are heavy and very good. Even better, they have apple butter in a squeeze bottle right at the table. I could almost make an entire meal of their rolls with apple butter. The only bad thing about The Apple Dumplin' is their location. They are located a few miles outside of town in the last place you would expect a restaurant to be. There is a reason it took me so long to come here....... because I didn't even know about it. We found it quite literaly by accident.

<Content> We tried to go here on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was full of people who had just gotten back from church. I am an Asian lady and was stared at by most of the people in the restaurant as if my partner had bought me on the Internet. If you are at all sensitive to social ambience and are not white, I do not recommend this place. I felt too uncomfortable to stay, which was just as well because nobody tried to seat us or acknowledged us in any way, so after standing around uncomfortably for a while we left. which is too bad because I like apple dumplings.

<Content> Ok, this place has decent food. Well, depending on the day. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not.However, for a small mom and pop place, they don't seem to do much to make people feel welcome. The last time I ate there was the last time. I had breakfast with a friend of mine, and all was going well, weak coffee aside. We ordered some breakfast, and the waitress (who turned out to be one of the managers or supervisors) asked if we wanted gravy on our potatoes.My friend said "I'd love it on the side, please" only to be told "No." When he said "no?" she replied "Gravy is complimentary, and you either have it on the potatoes or no gravy."I made the choice then that if one bowl for gravy was too precious to wash, then I would save them the time and effort by not going back. Problem solved, all dishes are clean!Skip it and go to Sam's cafe.

<Content> Someone told me that I absolutely HAD to try this place before graduating from U of I. That being said, I spent about half an hour trying to find this place. Walking in with my boyfriend (who is half Mexican, half Greek and very dark), the stares made it obvious that he was the most exotic being to ever step foot in the place. The food was alright, not good enough to justify getting lost trying to find it for thirty minutes. Call me a simple gal, but give me the Cracker Barrel over this place any day.

<Content> So someone my girlfriend knew said that this was THE place to try. Well with this advice, my girlfriend and I went and spent a good half hour trying to find the place. After the drive we were starving so we needed food. The place looked incredibly tacky as well as the fact that it was all white. And considering the fact that I have a dark complexion, I stood out like a sore thumb. The food was alright, but it was not worth the drive nor the stares. So if someone says that you have to try this place, just assume they were high and didn't know what they were talking about when they went...I obviously learned the hard way.

<Content> This place reminds me of my Grandma's cooking...and my grandma can't cook. We had the beef steak, fried chicken, and ham and beans. It was all pretty mediocre and not worth repeating. Even the apple dumplings were just okay. Too bad...guess if I want a decent home style meal I will have to do it myself. We are also a mixed family and didn't feel uncomfortable eating at this place as others have mentioned.

<Content> I did not know what to expect when I entered but I already knoew it could not be too bad as the line up for a table was manageable but there were definitely people coming out to eat there.The first thing I noticed was the kitchen and you could eat off the floor. Spotless . I then touched the salad bar wagon - ice cold.. I already new that this is a place that takes pride in not just the taste but the preparation.The food for the Sunday brunch felt like you were eating a home made meal. The chicken was the best fried chicken I have ever had and the pork loin was outstanding. MY only complaint is that there was not room on my plate by the time I got back to sitting down and coul not try everything. You will walk out of there feeling you have had an amazing home cooked meal and you will not need to eat any more. Congrats to Jim and Kathie for providing and outstanding venue for people who want to eat the real deal.. This will definitely be added to our list of recommended pla

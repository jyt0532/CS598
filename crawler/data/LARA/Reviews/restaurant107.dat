<Content> Restaurant reviewFor a family dining on a budget, this is a great place for pasta and sandwiches. Yes it is a fast food italian restaurant, but it is significantly better than a CiCi buffet quality. Depending on what you order the food is actually quite tasty. The chicken bake was slightly below a italian restaurant quality, but it is not something you can make at home and all of the price of 6 dollars. You also get unlimited breadsticks which is quite a deal. If you have kids this is a great place for a meal. If you want cheap italian food then this may also be the right place. Now if you are taking a date here then maybe you should look elsewherePro: inexpensive, fast, pasta cooked well, great for kidsCons: noneHidden gem:1.

Monday 6.99 whole cheese or pepperoni pizza4. Tuesday 0.99 cent kids meal and family night activity5. Wednesday seniors night dine for 4 dollars6. Thursday 4 dollar off family meals

<Content> I am not a pasta person but I am a sub sandwich person. I had the Italiano for lunch today. It has turkey, ham, bacon, lettuce, provolone, tomato and mayo. I am not sure what made this sandwich so good. Probably all the sodium and mayo. It is toasted and they toasted it just right with a little bit of crunch around the edges. The bacon was crispy which is a really nice considering most places just heat up raw bacon and its chewy and disgusting.

<Content> Fazoli's is just a fast food restaurant, although the real dinnerware is a lot better than eating off of a foam plate with a plastic fork. Price-wise Fazoli's is more expensive than going to other fast-food chains. The new thing is toppings for their baked pasta dishes. I tried the Mediterranean topping and it was greasy and overly spicy. I would not try it again. The bread sticks that we received were obviously not fresh and were actually a bit mangled. The kid who brought more to our table was a little surly, "Want more bread sticks?" he mumbled. On the positive side, the counter staff were super friendly and helpful.

<Content> Good basic food. Tasty sauce. Reasonable prices. Plus, it's a terrific place to take your single digit aged nieces, nephews and grandchildren. Fast food that doesn't taste fast. I'm a fan.

<Content> Not too shabby. The large pictures on the walls of kids monochromatically eating noodles was a little off-setting, but otherwise, you get what you pay for. I had the chicken margherita for (I think) $4. The crust wasn't crispy, but there were a solid amount of good tasting toppings. The breadsticks were also a nice addition. The key to this restaurant is finding the cheap, big servings and not expecting too much. For this particular day, that's all I asked for.

<Content> It's all about the Bread Sticks! Been a long time (years) since I went to a Fazoli's, was in a hurry so stopped in. Placed our order; got our table number & drink glasses BUT NO BREAD STICKS?  Saw a server working the dinning area BUT NO BREAD STICKS? Delivered our meal to the table and rationed our bread stick while we ate our salad and entre because we realized that there were NO MORE BREAD STICKS!

<Content> Keep on driving! There are too many good restaurants in this area to waste time on this one. We used to eat at Fazoli's restaurant often before we moved out of the Midwest. We stopped on our drive through IL yesterday and we were totally disappointed. The order taker was surly and not helpful. The restaurant was almost empty, but the tables were dirty. The pasta was bland. The bread sticks were AWFUL. They delivered 4 with the meal, but they were soaked in oil/butter-like substance and actually dripped when you picked them up. Yuck! We requested new bread sticks and got them, but we were close to being done eating before they arrived. Sadly, what used to be a good chain restaurant, has declined substantially in my opinion!

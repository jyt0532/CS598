<Content> I eat here occasionally because it is by my work. I think the pizza here is better than at the other one (if you have read my review of the other Monicals you would understand). I typically get carry out and lately they have had coupons for a $4 or $5 individual pizza which is the perfect size for lunch. Yesterday, I ate in with a friend and I must say this place is loud. Over the top loud. I had a very hard time hearing anything my friend said. We finished our food and got out of there so we could visit. Our waitress seem pissed off about something so we were very careful not to ask her for anything. She never smiled in fact, I am not even sure she said 2 words to us. It took 10 minutes for her to come and take our drink order. She also slammed down our salads, the dressing and our drinks and flew off in huff. I swear we did not do anything to make her mad. However, I do believe if I had to work in such a loud place I would be pissed off too. We heard a bunch of plates fall back in the kitchen and we knew what had happened. And that really made her madder. Oh dear! So, we ate our food, paid our bill (yes, we left her a tip) and ran out the door. We agreed that we would not eat in again but we will get the take out.The salad was cold and fresh and the dressing was really good. The pizza was cooked just right and I asked for light green pepper and I got 7 pieces. Bottom line is the food is good but I would advise carry out or delivery if at all possible.

<Content> Three stars because of nostalgia. Monical's has always been around, as long as I can remember. This location is probably the one I am familiar with the most because I use to live a few block from here when I was a kid. Pizza is average, thin crust in little squares that is pretty soggy. The Family Pleaser is what we always get. Which just adds an iceburg lettuce salad and soft drinks to a pizza order. Nothing bad, but nothing great either.

<Content> I really enjoyed my pizza at Monical's. To me, having eaten here during my graduate school days. A schoolmate advised me to ask for their French dressing on my pizza. It was absurd, of course, but tasted fantastic. Now I won't get it any other way. Thanks for the memories, Monical's.

<Content> This Monical person is only really good at making average pizza. The highlight of my pizza experience was the fact that they put a lot of mushrooms on my pizza. The Mozerella sticks were sorely lacking and the huge chocolate chip cookie I bought was pretty good. If you're looking for some average pizza, this is the chain to visit.

<Content> It's fine. Thin-crusted pizza (you can order a thicker crust, although I'm not sure why you'd want to) with the usual toppings. Some specialty pizzas, calzones, etc. The 8" pizza with a simple yet fresh side salad is the perfect meal.

<Content> Great, Great, Great!  They never disappoint. You tell them exactly how you want your pizza and they will deliver exactly that. I would call this the best Monicals in the Central Illinois area. Even over the original in Tolono...........Sorry!

<Content> Better than most chain pizza, it's ok. We got a thin crust, which was nice and crispy, only a little greasy, ok ingredients, not amazing on the cheese, and had kind of a bland crust.I guess that doesn't sound too good, but I really promise it's better than any national chain pizza you'll find in town. It also has a really friendly, laid-back atmosphere.

<Content> We ordered the stuffed pizza. While similar to a Chicao-style pizza, this had a bottom and top crust, as well as sauce on the top. It was FABULOUS! And it comes with 3 toppings for under $15. You gotta try it!

<Content> I nearly always grab carry-out. The individual pizza is reasonable enough and perfect size for a meal combined with a pair of breadsticks (definitely recommend with the nacho cheese option).They really need to work out the parking situation. Small lot and only one exit (no driving around the building) -- getting out is usually far more difficult than getting in.

<Content> Really cute ambiance with the octagonal shaped building and I am a huge fan of their gluten-free pizza, even though I can eat gluten. Price was completely reasonable ($10 for a 10" gluten-free pizza with sausage, pepperoni, green peppers and onions). Recommended. Also watch out for their coupons in the mail.

<Content> The staff here was quite friendly, but the fact that people love Monical's pizza leads me to believe they have never had pizza before. Its awful cardboard with some sauce and cheese on top.

<Content> I cannot believe Monicals gets such low ratings. They have the best thin crust I've ever tasted. And yes, do put the French dressing on the za!

<Content> I've been here twice and both times the food was what you would expect from Monical's. Both times we also had poor service. This is my least favorite location in Champaign. I prefer to drive to the location in Tolono.

<Content> This place offers solid authentic Chinese food. The register was packed when I arrived and the manager quickly noticed us hiding behind the swarm of people and we were quickly seated with apologies for the wait and noise. It is a slightly nicer place to have Chinese food in Chambana as the decor extends away from the fast food theme of their take-out menu. My family and I received the 'authentic' blue menu upon arriving (I'm assuming because we are Chinese) but if you don't receive it automatically I highly suggest you directly ask for it. The all inclusive hot pot was one of the best things I had there and can easily be a full meal for a single person as it includes clear rice noodles for some filling carbs. The shredded Szechuan spicy pork was a close second though it should be noted for people who don't know how Chinese pork is shredded, it is cut into thin slices and THEN cooked versus the famous bbq shredded pork in America which is slow cooked and then shredded by hand. This leads to a more solid texture in the meat and it great when paired with thinly cut vegetables as they do with this dish. The ziran beef had strong flavors and wasn't drenched in a sauce like Americanized places. For those who are afraid to try it, ziran means cumin so if you like cumin you will love this flavor of beef. The ambiance is great for large groups as most tables are large and plates are obviously meant for sharing. She does have small kids running around the area but I feel it adds to the homey feel of the restaurant.

<Content> The Good: -The delivery was super quick, it was only thirty minutes, and the delivery guy was very nice.-The Bao Bao platter was super yummy, especially the pot stickers, SO GOOD. -Their egg rolls are very good too.-The Little Donuts were super yummy, though standard.The Meh:-The price, the $25 delivery minimum was pretty high, especially for the price of the meals.-The Sweet and Sour Chicken. The chicken itself was cooked well, though the batter had very little flavor (understandable due to the dish being sauce based). The sauce was not something I enjoy at all, but SO thought it was decent.

<Content> Ok yes, it is a little shady. But hot damn is it my guilty pleasure. If you want that traditional American-Chinese food that we have all had since we were kids go here. Drinks are totally from 1950's. Love it.

<Content> Peking Garden is a delightful locale, and definitely one to visit as an ironic hipster in graduate school. The decorations are garish, the food is 'authentic' in that way that Chinese food is translated for Middle America. I found myself @ Peking Garden celebrating a friends' completion of his prelims. Nate decided that he was going to have a Mai Tai, and it came in a disturbing Fu-Manchu mug complete with exaggerated Asian features. I was horrified and delighted simultaneously.But not as delighted as when my friend Emily and I orderd the "Hawaii + Love Bowl," a gigantic bowl of alcohol filled with cherries and anchored in the center by a small well of rum--SET ON FIRE.Hells yes. Because nothing says, "I've just moved to a small Midwest college town" like "Let's consume the flaming jungle juice of the gods, ladies and gentlemen!"The food was good, although I found my shrimp fried rice as boring as it sounds. That was my fault for ordering it, not theirs for making it. I sampled everyone else's dishes however, and they were quite tasty. And when my uppity friend Myra bellowed that she didn't like our fortunes, they gave us brand new fortune cookies. Except the second time--my fortune was blank. Please Jesus, tell me that doesn't mean I'm going to die from drinking the "Hawaii + Love Bowl."

<Content> When my brother- and sister-in-law (who is Taiwanese) visited recently, we made the very great decision to let her order for all of us off of the secret menu. If you visit Peking Garden's website, they call it the "Exotic Menu." Nothing that I'd gotten off the menu for whitey had been bad, mind you, but the real deal stuff was awesome. In addition to Sizzling Rice Soup, Deep-Fried Shrimp (whole), and Twice-Cooked Pork, we were treated to Stir-Fried Lamb with Ziran and Bean Leaves in Garlic Sauce. The Ziran sauce was sweet, maybe reminiscent of cinnamon, and unlike anything I'd tasted in Chinese cuisine before. The Bean Leaves were vibrantly green, tender--not soggy, and studded with garlic cloves. AMAZING.I still have not had their giant alcoholic drinks, but I want to. I just want to have a cocktail big enough for two people while munching on bean leaves and garlic cloves. Is that too much to ask?

<Content> For years I lived a block from this little unsuspecting restaurant, and I always passed it by because I thought it was just another greasy counter serving your average Chinese fare. If you walk into Peking Garden and they hand you that menu with the classic Americanized dishes (General Tso's chicken, lo mien, fried rice, etc.), tell them that you actually want to see the menu with the traditional, true-blue Chinese dishes (squid, sea cucumber, etc.). Unfortunately, I can't vouch for the Americanized food items as I've never tasted them. However, there IS just one thing that makes this restaurant GOLDEN in my book: Peking Garden is the ONLY Chinese restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area (to my knowledge) where you can eat a very specific type of traditional Chinese cuisine called hot pot (sometimes called shabu-shabu in Japanese restaurants). If you've never eaten hot pot before, let me explain the general idea: a portable stove and miniature pot of boiling broth will be brought to your table. You will also be given plates of raw vegetables, meat, and noodles. You toss whatever you want to eat into the pot, wait a few minutes, and then start serving the soup from your table. Definitely a treat during winter months, and worth a try for adventurous diners!  I haven't tried too many other dishes here, but I did order dumplings once, and have been requesting them on visits ever since. Usually most Asian restaurants (even the Chinese ones) sell what I consider Japanese or Korean dumplings. The outside dough is paper-thin, indicating that the dumplings were probably bought frozen instead of prepared in-store. At Peking Garden, the dumpling dough is thick and chewy, the way Chinese dumplings are SUPPOSED to be! The meat filling is still a little plain (just ground pork and a few carrots, nothing special), but the dough wrappers are FO' REAL!The interior decor is that faded '80s look that seems to plague a lot of the restaurants in this area. You can't really tell if the evening mood lighting is actually mood lighting or if they just didn't bother to fix some broken bulbs. I wouldn't recommend this place for a romantic rendezvous, but it could be fun for friends eating in large groups.Everybody loves Lai Lai or Golden Harbor, and while the menus at those restaurants are a good deal larger, Peking Garden does have its own unique specialty, the hot pot. If you're not sure what to do when you get there, stare at the tables of Chinese diners, follow their lead, and you won't be disappointed!

<Content> I realize that the standards for Chinese food in this town are extreeeemely low. However, the fact this joint has such a high yelp rating leaves me distressed over the taste buds of my fellow yelpers.Fried rice- fairly standard, right? I've never had such a horrible and disgusting excuse for fried rice. There was nothing in it. No bits of egg, no meat, no shreds of carrot, no scallion, no onion, no peas. Nothing. A scoop full of sticky brown-ish rice. It smelled like cardboard and had no discernible flavor. Just rice doused with soy sauce. Effing gross.The chicken did not taste like General Tso. It was like they added a tad of soy sauce to the sweet n' sour. It was not spicy. It was not flavorful. And the meat itself? Dry, tough, stringy, chewy.The rangoon were filled with cream cheese, but they didn't seem to have any crab.This place blows.

<Content> I was excited to try Peking Garden after reading numerous positive reviews from here and other sites. I finally had the opportunity to try it out after suggesting it to a roommate over other options.Since I've reviewed another Chinese restaurant and hope to continue doing so, I decided it would be best to get the same dish (General's Chicken). I know this is not traditional Chinese but it is a common dish and is one of my favorites.The first difficulty I had with Peking Garden is ordering. They do not have a website and it is not easily found online. Luckily I was able to find one on campusfood.com. Next, I noticed that the entrees were sort of expensive (my dish was $10.90 with tax). This isn't too outrageous as the portions were relatively large but there are plenty of other, cheaper options in the area.After finding the menu and placing the order over the phone, I was told it would only be about 10 minutes until our food was ready. When we arrived around 10 minutes later, our food was waiting for us at the front counter. One thing that I did not care for right away was that the rice for both of our orders was included in one container. This isn't a huge deal but would have been easier for us had they been separate.  My meal had pretty good flavor, though it wasn't as spicy as other places. Despite the flavor, both my roommate and I noticed that the chicken was tough to the point it was chewy. This is probably the biggest reason for my 3-star rating as almost all other Chinese I have had has been very tender.Overall the meal was good but I doubt that I will be returning to Peking Garden anytime soon.

<Content> Debbie, the manager of Peking Garden, is always so incredibly courteous and kind to the customers. She remembers all of their names, and greets and hugs their kids too. I go there all the time, and it's such a nice refreshing change from many other restaurants with bad and distant service. Not only does Peking Garden have great service, but their food is so unbelievably tasty. Try their crunchy wontons or egg rolls for appetizers, they are always such a hot treat. You can also ask them to make a dish with special considerations (like "make it non-sweet") and they never give you trouble for specific requests (unlike other restaurants in town.)Overall, it's a really nice atmosphere with private booths, relaxing eastern music in the background and smiles for miles.

<Content> I have had Chinese food in many places - Peking Garden is certainly one of the very best of them.I love spicy food. That's why the spicy chicken from their special menu is my all time favorite. If you are into spicy food, you'll love it!To balance the heat of the spicy chicken, you can have the gan-shao shrimp. It's a sweet and sour dish and will certainly complement the fiery-hot spicy chicken.Other recommendations include mongolian beef, eggplant in garlic sauce, and fish-in-a-plate with spicy sauce.In ethnic restaurants I try to avoid dishes commonly found in fast food restaurants (orange chicken, general tso's chicken in a chinese restaurant for example). So, if you want to try something different Peking Garden is a great place - the owner, although not very fluent in English, tries her best to accommodate your needs.

<Content> I have a high standard for Chinese food, so most places don't get the coveted 5 star rating. Peking Garden was a weird case for me though.This place is EXTREMELY hit or miss, more so then I ever seen a restaurant be... The first time I went here with coworkers, the food was hot, came quick, and tasted terrific. At the time, I would have ALMOST gave it a 5 star rating. I was glad I didn't though. I went back a second time and the food came out cold, there was a long wait, and it didn't taste nearly as good. I went back a third time, and this time the food was just average tasting. My entree was great but the soup and egg roll tasted weird.. The service was also bad this trip. The 4th time I went back though was what ultimately makes the place deserve the 2 star rating, as not only was the service terrible, but our food took almost 45 minutes to come out and there were only three tables filled in the restaurant.The worst part was that me and my girlfriend got food sickness from it... It was not fun especially since we both had to work later that day. We are pretty sure it was from the egg drop soup. It had large chunks of either oil or raw egg in it, and we were sick for nearly two weeks with stomach cramps. Somewhat trivial but the day was only made worse as the waitress made pricing errors on my bill, of which I had to argue with her that egg rolls came with the lunch special and were not supposed to be an extra charge... At this point, other then the first time I went there, the food has been pretty sub-par, and food comes out cold way too often... Service can also go from great to absolutely terrible depending on who is working that day. I wanted to really like this place since it is close to my work, and the food is priced right ($6-7 for a big plate), but unfortunately, bad service, long wait times, and food that frequently goes from tasting good to absolutely terribly has me moving on. Eater's beware, maybe you'll get a good meal, but you may get a terrible one too....

<Content> I have had delivery from Peking Garden a few times. The delivery times have been good, but for the price I find the food to just be OK. The General Tso's chicken has been pretty bland, even when ordered at the "Hot" setting, and just tastes like deep-fried chicken in some sauce. It is life sustaining, but not much beyond that.The portions are HUGE...be advised!

<Content> My first experience with Peking Garden was two years ago when I first arrived in Chambana for freshman orientation @UIUC. I had found a delivery menu in the hotel. I was sorely disappointed with the quality and taste of the food, as well as the price.As it turns out, the delivery menu is the Americanized menu, which probably isn't what you're looking for, unless your favorite Chinese food consists of some chicken dish possibly invented by some sort of military guy.At the restaurant, make sure you get the Chinese menu (blue cover). The menu has English, Chinese, as well as Korean text.My family ordered the shredded pork with hot garlic sauce, stir fry beef with ziran, and the all inclusive hot pot. The all inclusive hot pot had fried tofu, bamboo, rice noodles, snap peas, Chinese sausage, mushrooms, and steamed meatballs. Bowls of rice are free and all you can eat! These are large portions, meant to be shared with at least one other person, unless you are very hungry!My favorite dish was the hot pot. The mushrooms were meaty and the soup was sublime. The pork and beef were both very tasty, great over some rice. No food was left behind. :)The owners are quite kind, although their children can be found running around the restaurant playing. This was a bit noisy, but I'm quite used to noise. Some customers are noisier, however.Overall, the food was great and the price was reasonable. Would definitely return here for another meal!

<Content> I love coming here. I love that the owner always remembers us and give us the Chinese menu. I love the Korean options. I love the mixed alcoholic beverages, which we have only tried once but left a big impression (ha ha).If you are normally inclined to stick with the "American" menu, please do reconsider at least once! Many of the alternative/more authentic items are explained well in the menu and if you have any questions, servers are more than happy to help.It isn't the most peaceful environment, and sometimes children are playing in the back room. However, if you can get past this, your experience should be five-star for sure!

<Content> Average fast food Chinese served by friendly people. I have always taken out here, and never ordered anything off the non-Americanized menu. It wouldn't surprise me if they have better items that I have yet to try, but what I have had so far has been very reasonably priced, well-portioned, and exactly what one would expect. Nothing wrong with three stars.If you are getting it for lunch at work like I often do, be sure to order off the lunch specials menu or you will overpay. Also make sure to set an alarm clock for 4:55pm to rouse you out of your food coma in time to go home.

<Content> I've only ordered for delivery here, but so far, my experience with this place has been excellent. The woman who normally takes my order over the phone is usually the same person who delivers the food to me. She is a sweetheart, and when I ordered from a different phone number than I normally do, she recognized my address right away when I gave it to her and asked how I was doing. What a great memory and way to connect with your customers!Now, for the food. I've only ordered a couple dishes from here, but I feel no need to change my order any time soon-Mongolian beef and the General Tso's is the usual. First of all, I love that they ask no questions about making things spicy/extra spicy. The mongolian beef is ordinarily not spicy, but when I asked if they could add some spice, they enthusiastically said yes- I haven't ordered it unspicy since. The beef is sooo tender and the sauce they cook it in is to die for. I literally would eat it everyday if I had a heart of steel. The General Tso's is pretty good, although not outstanding. It's a little too sweet and saucy for my taste, but I like to have something to contrast the beef, so this is usually what I go for.The only other dish I've ordered is the Fried Diced Chicken w Red Pepper. It's pretty much a party in your mouth. Super spicy, just how I like it- the chicken is cut up small, covered in batter, and deep fried, almost like popcorn chicken, and salty, which is awesome with a plain white rice. The only reason I don't order this all the time is because it's a little too spicy and I don't want to regret eating it the next day.So, I can't speak for a ton of dishes, but the ones I've had thus far have been very palatable. And the delivery service is great. Woohoo!

<Content> This is a very nice family-run Chinese restaurant in downtown Champaign, especially convenient for lunch specials that are well-priced. You will usually be waited on by the proprietress, who is one of the nicest and sweetest people in Champaign-Urbana :) The food is pretty good, although perhaps adjusted for American tastes. It reminds me of the many neighborhood Chinese places all up and down Manhattan. I've had a lot of good lunches there - I can recommend the chicken dishes and the shrimp kung pao. Also good won ton soup.

<Content> What a let down! I had my hopes high... I like Chinese food but I had been afraid to get it anywhere in Champaign for fear of being disappointed. But after reading the menu I thought I'd give it a try as it looked authentic enough (to me...). Maybe I ordered the wrong thing (Hunan chicken), but it was really disappointing: bland Chinese American, nothing tasty, nothing original. I took a few bites and threw the rest in the trash (... I can't believe I'm confessing to this!...). Kudos, though, for: the very extensive menu, the friendly waitress, and staying till 11pm (which is rare for Champaign). Maybe I'll give it another try.

I throughly enjoyed my chile chicken, fried chicken with chile peppers and a fiery hot sauce, which was the spiciest dish I have ever had in a Chinese restaurant. The meal ended with fortune cookies and a plate of succulent oranges. The service was great and the prices weren't bad either. I definitely recommend this restaurant.

Not to mention the dishes were served separately in three really cute bowls/plates complete with crispy won tons and soup. The service was also really awesome, fast, and it was cute because it was a mother and her two (really adorable) kids. The only thing was that it was a bit empty in there, perhaps because of the odd location. I definitely will be back to hopefully give this place it's fifth star!

<Content> The Clark Bar is a great place to hang out with friends. They have the best patio in town! Very calm and relaxing environment outside, dance floor in the back, pool tables and lots of seating make it a perfect place for whatever you desire to do at a bar. AND the food is fantastic!! The Clark Bar is for everyone!

<Content> The Clark Bar... Beautifully remodeled, gets busier as the night goes on... a great warm-up bar before heading out to C-Street or also an excellent alternative if you need a break from the 'only gay bar in C-U', as C-Street is so-often called.Great atmosphere, good pool table, darts, cool outdoor tiki-bar and funny staff with spunk.

<Content> Clark Bar is a casual, neighborhood bar. Don't expect much of a college scene here. And because the bar is off the main strip for downtown Champaign, you won't find the modern urban socialite scene, either. Most nights are relatively low-key, though they do host live music from time to time.  The place is deceptively large as rooms are sectioned off to allow for cozy, private settings for small groups. I love to sit in their patio area in the summer, which also has a layout that allows for some privacy among groups, including a small screened porch (for people who fear insects).The alcohol selection here is probably not indie rock enough to impress beer elitists. They offer standard beers and well drinks, but there are no obscure microbrews.For some confusing reason, Clark Bar is listed as a "tapas bar" on Yelp. I think that this classification is somewhat misleading as tapas evoke a distinctly trendy, European sensibility. While the tone of the food verges into tapas territory at times, the ambiance at Clark Bar probably wouldn't be suitable for an elegant dinner date. The menu ranges from standard fare (burger and fries) to surprisingly exotic. My carnivorous friends rave about the ribs, which are served exclusively on Wednesday and Friday. Once I stopped by and found fried ALLIGATOR on the menu, an exceedingly rare delicacy outside of the deep south (ESPECIALLY in Champaign, IL). Any appetizer they make with shrimp is absolutely perfect. As a fair warning, some dishes are only offered seasonally.The variation you see in terms of food might also apply to the clientele you meet here. Most nights the bars is populated by absolutely ordinary local people. However, during one surreal visit, I watched as a stream of people dressed in Victorian hoop skirts and silk waistcoats marched in. Not an experience you'd run across at most bars. Apparently Clark Bar was hosting a meeting of the local steam punk club that evening.I'd recommend Clark Bar for anyone who isn't scared of a bar with a "townie" vibe. This unassuming establishment serves some of the most interesting food in town, depending on the cook's mood. For those who love to people-watch, there are fewer prime locations in the area.

<Content> Dear Clark Bar,Please:1). Post your business hours plainly on your website and on your facebook page.2). Post your correct phone number on your yelp profile, or make it easily accessible under "contact info" on your facebook page or your website. Let's be frank- People shouldn't have to chase you down, dig through web content, or be a Champaign lifer to know when they can show up and spend money at your establishment.Thanks,

<Content> If you want to escape university culture and get a taste of "authentic" Champaign, then Clark Bar is the place to go. Spend a couple hours there for karaoke on a Tuesday or Friday night, and you will surely make some new friends and feel like you're on an episode of Cheers. Honestly, karaoke-ing there was the most fun I've had at a bar in a while...$2 draft beers, playing with the DJ's dog Brownie, getting chatted up by some colorful characters....If you go to Clark Bar, you will definitely have a story to tell without having to get schwasted or spending a bundle on overpriced drinks.

<Content> As a new-to-towner and a 30-something who is not a student or professional, I've been searching for a pub that catered to regular ol' folk like me. Clark Bar is truly one of those places. The building itself is sort of hidden from the rest of the downtown bar scene. The building is actually a Victorian-styled house that was remodeled into a bar. I can't really speak about the drink selections... I'm a simple beer and whiskey man. The domestic drafts are $1 on Thursdays, but might actually the special every day. The bartender was friendly and attentive.

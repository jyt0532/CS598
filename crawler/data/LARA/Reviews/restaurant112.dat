<Content> I LOVE Pizza M's pizza! My goal is to try every pizza on the menu. So far, I've had The Abbi. Eggs and bacon on a pizza? What an awesome concept! I've also had another one I can't remember the name of that had artichoke, goat cheese, onion, tomato, and peppers and we added bacon. So delicious! Pizzas are $15, well worth the price!

<Content> We got a margerita pizza which was alright, and a "Kitchen Sink" (chef's choice) which ended up being basically a breakfast pizza with bacon, sausage, eggs and olives which was pretty good. Only three stars because although the food was decent, it was just not that filling for the price, the iced tea was average at best, the environment was not the most comfortable, and the server didn't even bring the condiments (cheese, red pepper flake, sriacha sauce, tabasco sauce) to our table, even though there were a ton of carriers. The environment was so bad that it actually negatively impacted the taste of the food. This place was probably the most hipster restaurant I have ever been to though. It was actually kind of uncomfortable. They had all jars in lieu of real cups, a sprawling and disorganized looking selection of brews and wines, an ad for "bring your own vinyl night", and clearly very hipster clientele. These were not like nice hipsters either. They were the stereotypical of uppity better-than-thou hipsters. My cousins and I clearly didn't belong, but we kept on getting mean-mugged and got dirty looks, ironically from dirty looking hipsters. It is a shame cause I actually thought their flavor combinations on the menu looked really interesting, but the rest of the environment really detracted from the experience for me. There were four of us, we killed two whole pizzas, and were still hungry afterwards, so we needed to go get a second dinner.

<Content> Great artisan pizza. Our favorite in U-C. Our standard is the Mediterranean with goat cheese instead of feta.

<Content> Easily the best pizza in C U. Their pizza gets a 5 star rating but I lowered my rating because the staff could use some beer and wine knowledge. I can't be the only foodie/locavore that is equally obsessed with high quality beer or wine pairings.The staff is very friendly. Sometimes it can be confusing because they share a space with the flying machine coffee shop. They don't mean to be rude but if you ask the flying machine employee about a Pizza M transaction, they won't necessarily know what you're talking about or what to do to help you. Maybe they should consider wearing name tags to avoid this confusion?

<Content> Ordering was cumbersome. They take your name and then you sit down. They come out and call your name. They need numbers. The woman working the register also brought out the pie. It was slow and we had to bus our own table. We ordered breakfast, pear, and special pizza. All but special pizza were incredibly bland. Add sausage to the special pizza and it's delicious. Also, should sell pizza by the slice but they don't.

<Content> Pizza M is awesome. I find the negative reviews very perplexing, as the employee/owner I interacted with was very affable, and the pizza was delicious.Also of note: they sell Cheerwine and a number of other delicious sodas.You should go here.

<Content> BEST PIZZA IN TOWN!I really don't understand the bad reviews for this place. Yes, sometimes the wait is long but the pizza is made from scratch. If you want to eat some crap that only takes 15-20 minutes go somewhere else. Edible art is being made here. Service is always friendly and with a smile. Only thing I ask for (which I know is in the works), is more salads and soups. Keep up the amazing job!

<Content> Pizza takes a bit of a wait, but well worth it. I really enjoy the ambience and the fact that the restaurant shares its space with a cafe. I had some sort of Greek-style topping, including olives, artichokes and feta. Absolutely perfect, plus a little sriracha for kick. The crust has just enough chew and crunch to it. The best part about Pizza M is that you can get some coffee or pastry on the side. Or games! They have people do their game nights there, and it looks like a great idea.

<Content> Ice tea is awful! Pizza has potential but the toppings were scant! Our pizza was to have feta cheese...I expected more than the half teaspoon we received:(. Would like to see improvements in service.

<Content> Thought $4.50 was a little steep for a slice, seeing that you can get twice the quality for half the price at Papa Dels. Reminded me of school cafeteria pizza with a little better crust.

<Content> Artisan style pizza. It tastes really good. Will be back. Update: I came back and got the Pizza M. It was even better than the deluxe pizza I got the first time. This is my new favorite pizza spot.Update 2: Upgrading to 5 stars. My girlfriend and I had the Sugar Bear and now I'm thinking that Pizza M is the best pizza place in town. Can't wait to come back and get the sugar bear again.

<Content> I stopped in here tonight with my husband and almost 3 year old. We try to support local, non-chain restaurants as much as possible and this place is a prime example of the reason why. Great food at a reasonable price. I had a glass of wine while my husband had two beers. We ordered the meat and cheese plate while we were waiting for our "kitchen sink" pizza to go. The meat and cheese plate had a good variety of meats, cheeses, crackers, with a delicious jam and mustard and was well worth the $15 price tag. The owner (I believe) also came out and explained each item which was a pleasant surprise. We will definitely work this into our regular lineup. Oh... and the pizza was fantastic too.

<Content> Architecturally the space is impressive. Glad to see this section of Urbana being developed. Unfortunately the pizza is average at best. The special slice today was gorgonzola, bacon, pears, walnuts and maple syrup...sounds delicious, right? Completely lacking in flavor...1 bite of gorgonzola in the whole massive slice...no maple flavor at all...and the crust though tasty had no sauce to help me choke it down. I don't need it swimming but something to wet the mouth would have been appreciated. I'll give it another shot but first experience wasn't great. Oh, and my friends got their slices first while I waited for mine...restaurant 101...the whole table gets their food at the same time

<Content> I went to dinner with my friend Helen at Pizza M. The service was poor, the owner and waiter were defensive, and just down right rude to us. We were treated very poorly. We waited for over one hour. The pizza was fair, not great. We received the worst service in our lives. The experience was so bad that we plan to file a complaint to the local bureau. In a few words, it was a dehumanizing experience.

<Content> Worst service ever!I am accustomed to friendly, quality service at restaurants in this university town. I eat out a lot in the Champaign and Urbana areas. There are so many excellent restaurants to choose from. I typically do not write reviews or even complain about poor service. However, I received the worst service in my life at Pizza M. After waiting over an hour for my pizza, I inquired about how long it would take for my pizza to arrive. I said it in as nice of voice as possible. I completely understand when there is a mix-up in the kitchen. Both the waiter and owner were extremely defensive to my inquiry and made it seem like I was in the wrong for inquiring about the pizza. The experience was awful! What made it worst was the pizza was just okay. This is the first time I feel compelled to actively discourage people from patronage of this establishment. The experience was so bad that I plan to file formal complaints.

<Content> The best pizza you'll ever eat. The crust is perfectly crispy and the toppings abundant, local, and fresh. I love M's choice of bases (olive oil, tomato, etc) which perfectly compliment the cheeses and toppings. My favorite? The pear and brie. I don't think there could ever be a better pizza combo. They only take cash, and are only open on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, so just keep that in mind. I think it's a good thing though. I treasure Pizza M that much more because of it. It may be more pricey than Dominos, but let's face it: Dominos in no way compares to Pizza M. It's worth every cent.Rumor has it Pizza M might be getting their own place soon, and hopefully extend their hours (hopeful thinking). I can't wait!Update*** Now Matt has his own store front. Pizza slices as well as a a full pie. What more can you ask for? Hands down, the best pizza place in town. Period.

<Content> Another case of the Emperor's New Clothes. Someone of the artsy set decided that this relatively good but overpriced fare was great pizza and all the lemmings followed suit. Will anyone tell the Emperor he has no clothes? The limited hours, no delivery, and lack of dining area add to the snob appeal. Don't be taken in.

<Content> Best pizza in CU right now. It's local, has great crust, fresh yummy toppings, lots of vegetarian choices, and is a great deal. Limited hours of operation and no sitting or delivery are drawbacks, but it's a great location so it's pretty easy to stop by and pick up your pizza, and they are ready quite quickly after ordering.

<Content> Best pizza in C-U by a pretty wide margin; great crust, really interesting ingredients. The limited hours, no delivery and lack of a dining area keep it pretty car-centric, but it is worth the drive to pick it up.

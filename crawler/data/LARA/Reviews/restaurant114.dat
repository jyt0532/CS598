<Content> Was told that it will be a 30-40 minutes wait and given a buzzer. Walked around in other stores a bit. The buzz rang after 10 minutes.After ordering, waited for the salad for maybe 15 minutes. Then after the salad, received the steak in 10 minutes.Ordered a med-rare "Outlaw Ribeye", it was well seasoned but a chunk of it was still rare. Didn't call the waitress on it but was expecting more consistency on that piece of meat. The side baOverall, pleasant experience, the lighting was relaxing and the place was not too loud. The price is acceptable, if it wasn't for that rare chunk of meat.

<Content> The first time I ate here was right after it opened. For some reason I did not like the food. I gave it another chance a few months later and it went fine. I recently came here for lunch and it was great. Our server was on top of everything. I had the Parmesan crusted asparagus (I've had it before) and it was delicious as usual. My friend had steak and rice pilaf. I had the rancher's burger. Everything was good and service was great.

<Content> Expected more from this place. The steak (ribeye) failed to sway me. It was cooked right but had little flavor. The sides were alright. The appetizers were good. The service was somewhat suspect and overdone. When asked for a specific request, the staff took their time. I would go elsewhere for a steak.

<Content> Not normally a fan of chain restaurants, and this was no exception. The service was good, and the restaurant is well-maintained, but just on the other side of kitschy in terms of decoration.  The food was the true disappointment. I ordered the prime rib sandwich for lunch, which was 11.99. For that price, I expected a healthy amount and good quality of meat. Unfortunately, there were only a few straggly thin slices of beef on the sandwich, and those did not even taste good. I don't know if the meat wasn't fresh, but I didn't really want to eat it after it arrived, based on smell and taste.Furthermore, the rest of the sandwich was mostly grease, a few small mushrooms and some huge slices of grilled onions; one of them was as large as the sandwich bun. Not good, especially for a 12 dollar sandwich for lunch.Also, I "upgraded" to the parmesan garlic fries. My dining companion's fries were perfectly seasoned, but mine had huge clumps of garlic and butter, like the top fell off of the shaker when they were putting seasoning on mine, and they just served it like that anyway. Without more attention to the quality of the food, I don't see this place making it much longer in this town. Sigh, who am I kidding. People will still come here, it's a chain.

<Content> I've been twice now.. And the overall impression of this place is it needs an overhaul on management and service. The food has been pretty decent, except the first visit my ribeye wasn't they great. The second visit I went with the parm chicken and it was fantastic. The service is where this place is lacking. The wait staff is horribly unorganized and fumbles everything. Our waitress repeated our dinner order back to us as if we were at a McDonald's drive thru (was awkward). If this place is trying to be a mid to upscale steakhouse they need to hire professional and experience waitstaff! The time it took to get our check and pay took 15 minutes as she was waiting on her other tables first before simply dropping off our check that she had in her hand!Oh, and don't forget the rock hard butter for the soft bread. I really am mind boggled at this. How does anyone think this is a good idea? It basically makes the butter unusable. Overall, I won't be going back.. I'm sure there are some good waitresses and waiters in this place but I am 0 for 2 and this place is too expensive to take a chance at.

<Content> I'm always greeted by a welcoming staff and grab a quick seat in the bar area were the service is upbeat and friendly. I usually get something off the low calorie menu which tastes great and is a fair portion for the calories it claims.

<Content> Stopped in here for lunch on 10/13/2011 around 12:30pm. Had 1/2 prime rib sandwich, and lobster chowder soup. Soup turned out to be OK, nothing to write home about. I pick up my sandwich and just as I was about to take a bite...I saw a BLACK CURLY HAIR on my sandwich!!! I immediately sent it back and asked for a manager. The managing partner came out right away. He seemed very sincere and apologetic for what had happened. Not only did he comp my meal, he also comped my girlfriend's meal, AND gave me a $15 gift card to use at another time. In my opinion, he handled this situation exactly the way it should of been handled!  Even though I had a bad experience here, I will return and give them another chance! The managing partner was going above and beyond in order to keep my business. I appreciate his attitude and his customer service skills! Thanks to him, I will return to give the Champaign Longhorn a second chance!

<Content> We enjoy Longhorn very much, and it has become our "go to" for steak in Champaign. The food is delicious. The manager, Mitch Johnson, is very friendly and genuinely wants his guests to have a pleasant experience. He makes a point to check on you during your meal and usually follows up afterwards. If any Longhorn execs are reading this, Mitch is the real deal!

<Content> I went here last night with some friends and the food was really good. Yes, it is somewhat expensive but good none the less.I had signed up on their website and received a coupon for a free appetizer. We ordered the garlic shrimp and peppers. It was awesome! Some of the best shrimp I have had in a long time. And they have a kick to them which made them all the better.I ordered the grilled chicken and stuffed portabella mushroom with a loaded baked potato. Both were really good. The grilled chicken was perfect as far as flavor and very moist. It had a mushroom sauce over it that was not too much or too little. The flavors went together quite well. The stuffed mushroom was tasty too. This entree was only 12.99 only because it's chicken. If you want a steak here it will cost you a lot more. However, there are coupons usually in the newspaper or online for $4.00 off 2 entrees. They did not put enough sour cream and butter on the potato but that was easily solved by asking my server to bring me extra.I also like the decor of this place. It has a lot of interesting pictures. It was cow-boyish but yet had a certain elegance to it if that makes any sense. I thought it felt comfortable. It was not too loud and the tables are not so close together that you can hear other peoples conversations. Yes, I would recommend this place to a friend.

<Content> THE GOOD: the decor/ambiance is fantastic. You're surrounded by dark wood and low lights. The server recognized that I was trying to cut calories on my meal and went more in depth into how my meal was prepared (cheese, croutons, butter, etc). This is much appreciated because sometimes you think you're getting something healthy and then it comes with bacon. At one point, the chef even came out to help customize our orderThe food tasted pretty good but they were out of tilapia.THE BAD: Although it was nice that they chef came out to speak with us, it became excessive. Our waitress was checking in with us, the chef came out twice, and then the manager stopped by. By the time the manager had come around, we were done talking to people. She didn't have anything to say anyway!. They over did that part. And they were out of tilapia (although they substituted it with salmon)HOW TO FIX: coordinate with your servers, chefs, managers as to who is going to speak with the customers and how many times each has done so. Keep your fish in stock!STAY OR GO: I'd go again for a family meal or date.

<Content> I gave two stars because the food was tasty.However, this was our third try with longhorn and we officially will not be back. Our first trip, we came in forty minutes before closing time. To be courteous, we asked the hostess if it was still ok to be seated and if they still had time to serve us (seemed an easy question since they didn't close for forty minutes). The hostess stared at us a moment then said "I don't know". Long pause... So we left.Second try, we were seated fine, but it was like they forgot about us. We finally got service and food, but the servers seemed too interested in each others' lives to do a good job for their patrons.The other night, we were seated, waited over ten minutes for a server to even take drink orders. Waited over five for our drinks... Our wait for the appetizer and bread which came out together was about twenty minutes, and the salads and entrees followed almost immediately after. Our server mostly ignored us except for dropping off our food. The service was mostly schizo, and was the final straw for us.We gave you folks a fair shake. You aren't worth the money.

<Content> Friday night - 4 people - 8:30 pmIt was relatively packed. Our table ordered 3 drinks - a beer, whiskey, and mojito. The mojito was strong with simple syrup and not rum - not worth the 6.75. For entrees: prime rib + rice pilaf, filet + green beans, renagade top siroloin + loaded baked potato, filet + lobster tail + mixed vegetables.Summary: Entrees were salty and the filet was anything but legendary. The meat consistancy was mushy and flavorless. For $100+ save your money.

<Content> Pros: Food was delicious, and I had enough to take home (reheated well for leftovers). We had the lobster/shrimp/cheese dip appetizer (ooey, gooey, cheesy deliciousness). I had salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. He had ribs and salad.Cons: 1) The wait was extremely long (we didn't have a reservation on a Friday night), but when it was finally our turn to be seated, they tried to put us at a huge, round table for 6-8 when we were only 2 people on date night. No thanks! I saw a booth open and asked if we could be seated there instead. It took them about 15 minutes to wipe it down and seat us. 2) Our waitress didn't know what she was doing. She didn't give us water, she forgot to bring us our beer and wine, and basically forgot about us once she had dropped off our food.... it took us a while to get the check, which was unpleasant after waiting so long to be seated in the first place.Overall, the food was nice, but I'm not sure it's worth returning due to the poor service.

<Content> Jus ate here. Food was good. I'm a guy though and pretty easy to please when it comes to red meat. The ambiance is good. Good for a date and doesn't necessarily lend itself to families with kids in a good way. To me the service was excellent because while we had to wait a while to get service, the manager came by and apologized and gave us coupons. Not bad because we weren't really waiting all that long. After that the service was good and the mgr came back at least one other time.

<Content> Didn't' catch on that seasoned steaks were their thing. Suzanne's steak cam with a thick crust of seasonings that were was predominantly pepper.  Wondered what we missed in the menu so went to see one at the hostess desk. Soon the manager was at the table; asked if this was normal, yes was the answer that we have 'seasoned steaks'  I like pepper but it was more than I would eat..  We won't be back. Party of 4 was $100

<Content> My mom brought me here for dinner during Mom's weekend (when restaurants are PACKED!). We only had a short wait, even though we didn't have a reservation and it was prime dinner hour.Our waiter was very helpful and attentive, he offered good suggestions. Our salads came out quickly and were delicious.  We did wait a long time to get our entrees; our waiter apologized several times for the long wait. He ended up offering us a free dessert of our choice to compensate for the long wait time. That is excellent customer service. And the food was quite good for a chain restaurant.

<Content> Longhorn Steakhouse has snuck into the #2 steakhouse in the Champaign-Urbana area for me. It's a new spot and the decor and atmosphere is open and exciting. I really like the food (they had a lobster, bacon and cheddar baked potato that was the truth), but the wait staff was understaffed and the drinks were on the pricey side. I definitely want to see what else they have to offer...more to come.

<Content> My boyfriend and I picked this place for our lunch break while Christmas shopping on a Monday. We arrived at noon and were seated immediately. The first thing I did was use the restroom and they were VERY clean. Our waitress was at our table when I returned and was very nice and ready to help us out. It was our first time here so we weren't sure what we wanted so the waitress had to come back twice. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with a Sweet Potato and Oh, my! - it was DELICIOUS. My boyfriend had seen their commercial for the Lobster-stuffed Steak but unfortunately that was not on the lunch menu. He settled for shrimp, fries and a baked potato. He did not seem to enjoy his meal as much as I did though. All in all, I would definitely return here and I would definitely recommend it to others.

<Content> Needs improvement. The food was pretty good but it's clearly a new store. We called ahead for reservations that morning, when we arrived we were told it would be 30 minutes, but we waited 55 minutes, the same as those without a reservation. When they did seat our group of nine, they asked to put us in a booth that wasn't made to fit a group our size. Shorted silverware, not given plates for bread, the onion chips had skin on them, found large sharp piece of plastic in ice cream. Server was kind and attentive. Oh, and the booth we sat in had huuuuge lumps or uneven sections, I felt like I was riding a wooden camel.

<Content> This place is awful. The food is terrible and you could get a better steak at an Applebees or the Chili's right next door. Not only that, the wait staff and the manager at the Champaign location are awful. I went here for my 1 year anniversary with my boyfriend who has food allergies. I called ahead to make sure they could make something he could eat and they said they could. WE got to the restaurant and made sure the waitstaff knew about his severe allergies. Every dish he ordered came out wrong and with things he was allergic to on it. The salad, the baked potato, and the porterhouse. The waitress was nice and said she would take it back, but then the manager, Tony, came out with the same steak that had an unknown red sauce on it that my boyfriend couldn't risk having without going into anaphylactic shock. The manager argued with us for about 10 minutes over the steak and refused to listen to our concerns. He berated us and treated us poorly. Finally, we just wanted to pay for my meal and leave but the manager refused to let us leave! He said he just put another steak on for my boyfriend and that we HAD to wait for it. So we did, unfortunately. The 2nd steak came out rare rare and was so undercooked. I don't have any food allergies and my food was not good at all either and was way too salty. Definitely not worth the price of $20-25 per person!!! Do not go here!!! The people are horrible and the food is not good. And if you have any food allergies definitely do not go here or bring your EpiPen pen with you!

<Content> Jack Daniels burger and fries... extra JD glaze? My mouth is watering!The staff is amazingand eclectic. .. and always friendlier than just about anywhere else in town. The constant happy birthday singing annoys me every time, and would usually lose a star, but the fact they have a big chief illiniwek mural on their wall saves that 5th star for me.

<Content> This TGI Friday's is not the greatest. I sat at the bar, which almost wraps all the way around. This seems to be a common down fall of TGI Friday's. They have too big of a bar area and never enough servers /bartenders. You can go neglected at the bar for quite a while. The food is mediocre. I was hungry after a long day of travel, so I ordered the Jack Daniel's steak with lobster tail. The steak was cooked well and tasted ok, but would not recommend the Jack Daniel's sirloin. Is only cooked with that BBQ sauce and some on the side. It's not worth the extra price. Get the regular sirloin and maybe ask if you can get that BBQ sauce on the side. Also, do not get the lobster tail. It was ridiculously small. It had two bites of meat in it and they didn't even serve with melted butter. NOT WORTH IT. The macaroni and cheese was pretty good and works for a side. The "fresh" broccoli was fresh out of the refrigerator. It was still cold, not cooked well.

<Content> My memories of Fridays center around suspenders and buttons, and forgettable food. I stopped going to Fridays years ago for lack of interest, boring food, and excessive prices. I've not wanted to party like it's 1989 for some time. Well, I gave Fridays another shot, and I've not been disappointed. I went earlier this month. And it was so good that I returned a second time this month. I have actually been impressed twice. The food was really great the first time. The service was really great this time. The manager immediately took care of a minor glitch on our latest visit. I have to hand it to them. They really have moved past the era of the red and white stripes, ugly suspenders, and over the top buttons Their menu is better than it has ever been. All six people in my household want to go here, and that's saying something. I might even make it a threepeat this month. Whilest this is not "smack your granny upside the head and ask her why she can't cook like that" kind of delectable fare, this place is pretty damn good. Good stuff, Maynard.

<Content> I'm on a very restricted diet so it's difficult to eat out. Our waitress Alicia P. went above and beyond to make sure I left with food in my belly, and a smile on my face. She took a crazy amount of time working with me to create a delicious meal that was Ideal Protein Plan friendly. So remember, just because something isn't on the menu, doesn't mean they won't create it for you! (chicken breasts, garlic shrimp, and spinach with mushrooms on the side) Amazing!

<Content> The TGI Friday's I'm used to going to is nothing special. But this one is great!First the place looks really nice. It doesn't look like a tacky family restaurant. It's has a very fresh, sports bar atmosphere. Their beer and drink selection is excellent, the server was great, and the food is delicious. My burger was great and I tried some of my friend's food. I was jealous! His was even more delicious. The only problem I had with this restaurant is their desert selection was really limited.

<Content> Me and a friend went here to get the Jack Daniels burger. The host was very quick and very nice. After being seated we looked over our menu and sat there and waited and waited and waited. After 10 mins of being ignored not one single staff member stopped and talked to us. What a shame and an embarrassment to have customers walk out.

<Content> This would've been a five had a little cockroach not ran across the table after we paid the bill. Service was great!- Ultimate SangriaYeah, super good! - Warm Pretzels with Craft Beer-Cheese Dipping SauceOne of our new favorite appetizers! The pretzels were obviously deep-fried. But that's ok, they were super hot, crispy on the outside, and pillowy inside. - Jack Daniel's Burger w/ Fries- Jack Daniel's Chicken Sandwich w/ ChipsIt was a burger kind of Friday night, so that's what we both had. No complaints

<Content> Tgi Fridays is one of my favorite places to eat and I was very excited when I found out is was coming back to champaign. With that said our visit there was poor, and it was clear the wait staff was poorly trained and managed from the hostess to the kitchen. I'm giving them a 1 star in hopes the owner will take these reviews into consideration and fix the problems since I want this place to succeed. I will update my review when and if they turn it around.

<Content> Ok, a friend and myself dined here this past Saturday. We arrived at 10pm and upon our arrival there was NO one at the hostess station; however, a small group of waitstaff and the hostess were gathered at a table directly adjacent to the hostess station. We stood there looking at them looking at us like "why are yall here???" I immediately thought to myself "damn are they closing?" So I looked at the door to check the closing time, which was posted as 1AM!!! After saying Helllllo to them, a young lady then scurried over to seat us. Not a whole lot of people were there (weather was awful that day) and again the waitstaff were just sitting around. NOT good. A young lady finally came over to take our order for drinks and kinda just hung around looking at us. I thought this was soo friggin wierd! We then proceeded to order an appetizer of the spinich and artichoke dip, when it came, the chips were burnt and hard as a brick! I immediately sent that crap back! We get those back with fresh(er) chips but I still wasn't impressed by those.Our entress came and were "alright".My biggest complaint was about the waitstaff! (They were just sitting around looking at people like why are any of you here)! LOL It's my assumption that the management had gone home for the day and they all just kicked back! This place had better get there service together and QUICK! This place is nothing like the old location, which was always a good experience. But I'll be back, because I like Friday's food and I have some rewards that I need to spend. LOL

<Content> Food, 5 stars, service, 5 stars, atmosphere 4 stars. I had the Jack Daniels steak, great flavor. The vegetables were fresh and tasty. They sat me in the bar section, which was basicly undecorated. When I go back, I will ask to sit somewhere else, which is nicely decorated.P. S. The food must be good, as I witnessed tons of, to go orders.

<Content> 5 stars!! My friend and I went here last night and I had a blast! We sat at the bar and the bartenders were wonderful. They were very busy but were able to keep up with the orders and maintain a good sense of humor the whole time. Our bartender asked us if we would like to try a drink he had been creating. Of course we will! It was really good. My friend who is strictly a beer drinker even liked the mixed drink.The decor is very nice and chic. another thing I noticed was that it is not really loud inside like the old location. At the old one I would have to yell in order to be heard. it is all open and looks nothing like the Chevy's that used to be here.We ordered appetizers. Some kind of chicken Asian skewers and loaded potato chips. I loved the skewers. They were made with cilantro and I love cilantro. The Asian Cole slaw that came with the skewers was really good too. The loaded potatoes were OK. My friend liked them. I probably would not order them again but she would.I really want to go back and have dinner sometime. The prices are average among other dining establishments in the area.

<Content> This is my first visit to TGI Fridays at this location. Kinda surprised it wasn't added to yelp.com. So I did.Evidently it has been here operating for a couple weeks. Kinda surprised that they didn't have NTN Buzztime trivia to enjoy. Friendly staff as always. Food was good. My steak was ordered MEDIUM. It arrived WELL-DONE. So it went back and was cooked properly the second try. The other the meals and appetizer was prepared properly and was highly enjoyable. The server initially had a hard time keeping my coca cola full. Had not my steak went back, they would have received 4 stars. Because service was just OK...just an average rating they receive.

<Content> This place has terrible service! Poor customer service from management and poor table service. You should not have to wait 40 minutes for your food when everyone else is eating. Even people that came after us were eating. And telling my they can bag my food up so I can take it home is a joke,,doesn't that defeat the whole point of eating out. Oh and thank you (insert sarcasm) for paying for one beer!!! I will never eat at this Friday's unless corporate shows them how to improve their customer service. What a joke. I can get better service at the drive thru at McDonalds and that's not saying much.

<Content> They're back. So good to see TGI Friday's back in Champaign. The food is excellent especially the Jack Daniel's menu items. With the Ribs being the best. You have just got to try them once. The wait staff was hit and miss at first but after some training they're getting better as well. Excellent atmosphere and good food, can't beat it.

<Content> Having eaten at many Friday's around the country, this one has the best decor I have seen. Most Friday's seem to go overboard with the memorabilia. The mural on the wall is great link to the community. I need that artist to come paint something similar in my son's room.As for the service, they were very busy for a Friday night. But with so many tables, my wife, 2-year-old son and I were seated within 10 minutes of check-in. The hostesses were very friendly and even talked to my son. Our waitress was very friendly and checked up on us regularly. However, other waitresses did seem frazzled and lost. We had one stop by our table to ask to see the kids' menu.Our appetizer (chips and salsa) came out quickly with very fresh chips. Shortly after the chips were gone, our food arrived and was very good. My only complaint is my steak (ordered medium-rare) was slightly overdone but not to the point requiring it to be sent back.Overall, it was a great experience and we'll return soon. Now they need to bring back the fried mac 'n cheese and cherry limeade slushes.

<Content> Caucasian female bartender is awful! Not only is she very rude and curt with customers, she refused to honor my free dessert coupon via my mobile phone. She told me I had to go home and print it out, even though the coupon says that I could use my device to redeem it. I told the manager, who was eating lunch at the bar. She wouldn't even stop eating to see what my concern was. Finally, she waved me over to over to her seat. WHAT? I guess my concern wasn't important enough for her to get her butt off the barstool and come to me. Geeez!!!!

<Content> Slow slow slow!! There was four in our party and we were told the wait would be 40-50 minutes to be seated even though there were many empty tables. We told them we'd take any table, even in the bar area. We were seated at a bar table in about 25 minutes. Our waiter was very nice but not very organized. It took over 10 minutes to get our drink order and another 10 minutes after that for him to take our food order. One of the drinks had a long black hair in the glass so we had to send back. Gross. Our food came fairly quickly, however we were missing part of one order. We notified the waiter and also asked for more napkins. Neither the rest of the order nor napkins ever came. There's no excuse for that.  The waiter also never came back after that to check on us. This was not a good experience and I probably won't go back. I had high hopes when it was opened but sadly does not live up to expectations.

<Content> My friends and I visited this Fridays location around five thirty on 12/30/2012. This was perhaps one of the single most wretched dining experiences I have ever had. I had been initially impressed by the renovation of the building, it looked quite nice inside. However, it soon became clear that the staff was very very poorly trained. The waitress, though terribly sweet seemed lost in the menu. It took ages for the first wave of food to arrive at the table, and the kitchen sent out one entree ten minutes before the rest. Forcing one friend to either eat cold food, or eat before the rest of us.When the bulk of the food did finally arrive, it turned out that the kitchen had forgotten to prepare two of the entrees. The traumatized seeming waitress apologized and scurried off to try and get the kitchen to prepare the rest of the food. Flash forward twenty minutes later, and she brings *one* more entree to my friend and says "OK! Have a nice meal" It was at this point that we all realized that she has no idea that I had also still not received my meal. She acted surprised, and then tried to act as if I hadn't actually ordered anything. Then when she reviewed her ticket she came to the realization that she had simply forgotten mine altogether. At this point, everyone else was finished with their food, and I was starving and exceedingly cranky. She went back to the kitchen (Which is exposed to the dining area so everything they are doing at the food window can be seen. Especially when they are dramatically talking about a table that they are unhappy with) and waved her arms about angrily to the female manager in the pink sweater. About ten minute later the waitress finally produced my tepid food, slapped hastily onto a plate. Starving, I didn't bother to point out that they had not included one of my sides, but did ask to speak to the manager. This manager was in no way shape or form prepared to handle an upset customer. She arrived at the table combative and rude. The way to handle a customer who is rightfully upset with their treatment is not to then embarrass them for complaining and still not comp their meal or even bother to offer any sort of *genuine* apology. Pink sweater manager on duty. Please report to corporate for proper training on how to both run your restaurant, and deal with the unhappy patrons you have tortured.I paid for my meal, and tipped the waitress twenty percent, as it was not her fault that the manager had not correctly trained her. However, I would suggest avoiding this location at all cost until it receives further training intervention on the management level from corporate. Had the manager been polite, and handled the situation properly, this review would have been unnecessary.

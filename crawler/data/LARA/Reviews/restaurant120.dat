<Content> i believe this is the best bar in this area, and when I walk in this place it give a new feel about the bar, modern, and rock! The food is good and the price is fair.Drink is so deliciousand I went to there lots of times, not only for fun but also for the service. The dancers are so hot and the Dj is really professional. I didn't get point for who give the so low rate for this place.

<Content> April 2, 2014 - Ben B. gives A Plus VIP Lounge a 1-star review.April 3, 2014 - Evan B. gives A Plus VIP Lounge a 1-star review.April 6, 2014 - Four first-time Yelpers give A Plus VIP Lounge four separate 5-star reviews.Three out of the four mentioned that the drink prices have been lowered. Three out of the four mentioned the "hot" dancers/ waitresses.Two out of the four mentioned the nice "decorations" (WTF?)If you think those 5-star reviews are genuine, I have some ocean-front property in Nebraska that I'd like to talk with you about.

<Content> Walking into this place, I had high hopes for what I'd find inside. It's got a nice sound system, lighting is nice and the decor is beyond what I had expected. The issue with this place is that it's clearly owned by people who have not spent much time in a nightclub. First, if you're going to buy bottles, there should be no cover charge. Second, if you're asking about bottles at the door, there should be at least 2 hosts (and the owner if it's as slow as it was that night) greeting you and asking how they can help. The drinks are under poured, the cups and under sized and I was less than impressed with the clientele. If you want people to spend lots of money in your club, then you need to dress the part. Sadly, this place isn't going to survive . . .

<Content> Well, I should say FINALLY THERE'S A TRUE NIGHTCLUB!!! Fantastic decoration, stunning sound system, hot waitress (which I think very important!!!) And of course all kinds of drinks. Price used to be a bit high(but worth it personally speaking), but I've just heard that they adjusted the price(AWWWSOME!!) I definitely need to go check the wine list myself! Maybe you should, too. One more thing to say, I have read other comments below and here's my thoughts: Walking into VIP zone or fled with unpayed bill, that's not the club's fault I guess? Let you stay the VIP zone is just been nice and charge before serve is just being cautious as far as I can tell. Anyway, check it out urself and prove whether I'm right or wrong!

<Content> @ Evan B and Ben B. Does it surprise you that all 4 first time reviewers appear to be Chinese and the joint appears to be owned by a Chinese?

<Content> Had a bit doubt when I heard it the first time. Just have checked it out last weekend and guess what, I LOVE IT! THE MUSIC IS BEYOND AWSOME!!! I used to have the thought of open a bar like this. Since there aren't any premium or high-class club here at CU. Shame it's still a thought to me but someone else make it real. This is my first comment, usually I'm too lazy to leave any but not this one! I'm telling u I'll seek for job there, maybe u will see me working there next time you go to A plus! At least I could be part of this club? l don't know lol

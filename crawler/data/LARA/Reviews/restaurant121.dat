<Content> Just a quick update:This time, SO and I order some Orange Chicken and Dumplings. Dumplings were solid this time, very good. Orange Chicken was pretty good too, had an actual orange flavor rather that weird Tang/Hi-C "orange" flavor. Deliver was just as quick as last time, around thirty minutes from order to delivery.

<Content> I'm not a picky person, but there were a couple things wrong with my experience with China King:-Delivery was late, taking over an hour and a half for a simple order.-I asked for utensils with the delivery, and the driver did not have any.-There were only 2 pieces of shrimp in my order of shrimp and broccoli. Pretty cheap.-They weren't shy on soy sauce packets, but I only received 1 little packet of sweet & sour sauce with my sweet & sour chicken. Doesn't that usually come with an extra container with it?I think I would have been much better off going to Panda Express.

<Content> Oh man, my experience with this place was my worst chinese delivery nightmare from start to finish. Delivery minimum, so I had to order 3 dishes even though I couldn't possibly even eat 1. Driver got lost on the way to my house and called me. He was about 100 feet from where I was and all he had to do was turn left, but he could not speak English well enough to understand what I was telling him, and didn't seem to be motivated enough to actually try to go in the directon I was telling him to go. We were on the phone for about 15 minutes. Then I at last had the food in my kitchen. The menu claims no MSG but my food tasted like 4 different textures of MSG. When I opened my (admittedly totally tired) General Tso's Chicken, the first bite (and all subsequent bites) I took was overpowered in flavor by the 4 sad sorry florets of brocolli that had been thrown in the box. My sweet and sour pork that I had to order to meet the delivery medium was of the sweet and sour comes in a separate tub and has to be combined with the deep fried pork pellets variety, which is my least favorite variety.At least the dishes were themselves inexpensive?

<Content> This is my go-to cheap Chinese place. Great chicken, delicious crab rangoons, and fast service. I've never dined in, but it looks like an alright dine-in space. It's super close to where I work so I drop in quite often for lunch. They have a nice lunch deal, too!

<Content> This has become one of my favorite lunch places - the food is cheap, doesn't take too long, and is delicious!! I'm a big fan of their sesame chicken (when it's good), as it has a bit of a kick to it. Lunch and dinner combos are a great deal, and I love the crab rangoon. The restaurant is kept clean, and I love the guys behind the counter - so friendly! The only con is that the quality seems to vary at times. Last week, the sesame chicken was the best I'd ever tasted. Got it again last night, and this time, it was good - not even mediocre, a solid 'good,' - but I wanted what I had last week. :( Still, I recommend it for a quick lunch or dinner.

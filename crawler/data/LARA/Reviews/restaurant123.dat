<Content> These empanadas are excellent- we are Argentinean, so we know good empanadas, and these are the real deal. The price is very reasonable for the large size of empanadas you get and they are delicious and very fresh. There are many varieties available, but the classics like beef and chicken are especially good. The dulce de leche empanadas are to die for!

<Content> I went to the place on Green St today. I went because I saw their trucks around campus and I LOVE empanadas so I thought I would give it a try.The only reason why I gave it 2 stars and not 1 was because the people there were SUPER NICE and the restaurant itself was REALLY CLEAN. Which are both positives. Unfortunately the empanadas themselves were kind of flavorless and not that great. The bread part wasn't flaky and was kind of waxy to be honest. They have a really limited selection as well--pretty much just beef, chicken and a vegetarian option. None of the potato and cheddar or even the dessert ones that you get at a place like Manolo's near Canopy. I wouldn't come again. Plus side it didn't break the bank: three empanadas for six bucks.

<Content> I love the empanadas from the Empanadas House! They're authentic Argentine empanadas and they are delicious! If you have a sweet tooth try the Dulce de Leche with Walnuts!

<Content> The empanadas were awesome! They were so fresh and flavorful. It was a great deal; the empanadas are about 4 inches long or so. When I went they were experimenting with two Peruvian style empanadas: a chicken one and a steak one. Both were excellent. I loved finishing my meal up with the dulce de leche & walnuts empanada :D

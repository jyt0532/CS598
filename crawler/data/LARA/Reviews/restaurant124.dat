<Content> Upon arrival, I was a little bit scared of the wait to get seated, since I came with a party of 15 people, and the place was PACKED. However, they definitely worked super fast and we got seated in less than 30 minutes. Being a big fan of American dining, I had always be using skillets as my control group to test the quality of the restaurant. Hearing only good things about this place, I had relatively high expectations. And long behold, this place does not disappoint.I first ordered a strawberry creme smoothie. It came in a chilled glass mug. Upon first sip, I could taste the strawberries. Not many restaurants can do that. Within a few minutes I decided to order the Blarney Skillet because I am always a sucker for corned beef. The food was served within 10-15 minutes. And Dear God, did the combination of both hit the spot! The skillet itself is not greasy, yet you feel like you are eating something substantial. The taste of the ingredients are further complemented by the hollandaise sauce, which was mixed with the two sunny-side-up eggs to perfect the combination. The waiter/waitresses were very attentive. They constantly swung by to ensure that we have enough water as my buddies and I just chatted after we finish our meals. They were super polite and gives great insight when asked to provide recommendations of items on the menu. The best part about this place is probably the price. The two items: smoothie and skillets, came to a combined total of approximately $12 including tax, which is not bad at all! I would highly recommend this place if you have a mean of transportation to get here!

<Content> Le Peep is a chain found all over the place, but it took a 16 hour road trip for me to try it in Urbana. It's quite an alright breakfast place. The omelettes are quite good, and it's pretty affordable - all in all a solid breakfast place. If that's what you're looking for, then there's no reason why you shouldn't come here.

<Content> The price of their food is too high for the quality. I would rank this food on the same level as the pancake house but for more money. Also, there is nothing French about their omelettes. I haven't tried the crepes so i can't give my opinion.

<Content> The drifter skillet is phenomenal! The skillet is filled with seasonal veggies, no grease, and the eggs are incredibly fresh. Our waitress was phenomenal: super friendly and attentive, yet not over-bearing at all. I can't believe this establishment is a chain?! My husband and I arrived around noon for brunch, this past Easter Sunday. A great plan! I'm wondering if they're BYO friendly. I'd love some champagne in my OJ:)

<Content> The food is standard and what you'd expect from a breakfast place. It comes out pretty quickly too. Nothing I've had is really exceptional to make it stand out from other breakfast places. The atmosphere is casual but not greasy. Service is always good.They have"lattes" on their menu, but these are not made with espresso. I would have known if I had glanced over at their "latte" machine, the same kind gas stations have (I love gas station "lattes", but it wasn't what was expecting here.) If you want coffee, get regular bottomless coffee instead.

<Content> This is like the equivalent of Egg Harbor of the suburbs. A lot of flair, but nothing there!Anyways, I went on a Sunday morning. The service was great, the coffee was fantastic, and the wait was non existent. A good start to the meal!I usually get the 2 x 2 x 2 (pancakes, eggs, and breakfast meat), but with school starting tomorrow...I decided to do something different.I decided to order French Toast, the "Le Petit" option. It came with bacon (which they gave me sausage instead for some reason...crisis averted later, but I digress). With my bacon in tow, I also asked for some strawberries on top. I got two eggs scrambled on the side, too. So I guess I got the 2 x 2 x 2 just under a different moniker. Needless to say with the order mess up, I wasn't shocked to find that the food was "Meh". If you're in CU, stick to Original Pancake House or Cracker Barrel for eggs and oatmeal. I wish I went to one of them today instead!I also tried to "check in" here, but my phone didn't let me...come on Le Peep!Hey, I've got a secret. You can't say a peep to anyone you know who likes this place. There are better options around. I wish I tried Sam's Cafe today instead!

<Content> Came here after Original Pancake House was too packed, was craving for a delicious Sunday brunch and Le Peep definitely delivered. Got seated immediately and ordered a stuffed French toast (flavor of the day was chocolate chip). Great French toast, very filling and tasty. Also tried the garden omelette which was very light and also delicious. Unfortunately the coffee was sub par, but most diner coffees are. Overall, the service was great and food was good, and the comfortable, happy atmosphere of Le Peep definitely makes it worth visiting.

<Content> Decent breakfast food. I had some sausage and potato skillet smothered in gravy and topped with runny eggs. Yum but it was 95% potatoes. Coworker had something hollandaise and said it was average. Pancakes are average. Service is quick and friendly though. It's a good find for breakfast in this small town.

<Content> I've never been here before, but one of my friends suggested this as the traditional last meal before the drive back to Ohio. There was a 25 min wait which in my opinion was not bad. What breakfast brunch place doesn't have a wait on Sundays anyways. Once we were seated I gazed over the menu and became focused on the skillet items they had. Everything sounded tasty. I chose a sausage skillet plate that had gravy with a basted egg on top. It didn't disappoint. Upon delivery it was piping hot and visually pleasant. Each bite was good mmmm good. Definitely suggest this place for anyone in need of a good meal.

<Content> Their classic cubed potatoes are very very good. Their gypsy plate is fantastic. However, there are things to improve on that need attention.One time we went there, our waitress said that they "don't take credits cards at the table", which is total BULL because all the other waitresses that served us there did. It seemed that she didn't feel like doing her job, or that she felt "superior" to us.Another time, we learned through the manager that they carefully measure every portion of potatoes per plate...he said every plate "only gets" 8oz per serving. He wasn't so friendly and he cut us off while talking.Today I went and got their Seafood Crepes for $7.75. The dish says it is stuffed with seafood...A total LIE.It is ONLY stuffed with cheap *imitation* crab meat, wrapped with a couple layers of oily egg. Gross! If you don't know what imitation crab meat is, it's not real crab meat. You can get it under $4.00 at walmart!Looking at the plate, I immediately realized they were not using real seafood, so I told the waitress Patti about it. Thankfully she was human and decent about it and did not charge us for the plate, in light of how the plate description was *not honest*.We left and I am not sure I will be returning.

<Content> Visited Le Peep yesterday (5/2/2012). Both I and my guest experienced marvelous food. She had an homestead eggs Benedict and I had a standard ham and cheese omelette. Pictures of both were taken and uploaded. Hers looked fantastic.My omelette was excellent. Light and fluffy. Melty cheese that was great. And the ham was great. I tend to like my ham chunks to be more substantial... It didn't take anything away from the omelette at all.The servers were nice and we got a pair of them as one was in training. We were treated like royalty. No complaints.5 stars.

<Content> Le Peep is Mario from Super Mario Bros. 2. Mario is not as fast as Toad, doesn't jump as high as Luigi, and doesn't float in the air like Peach. That is why I never go back to Le Peep. Merry Ann's, Sam's Cafe, Pancake House and Courier Cafe are all better than Le Peep in one way or another, be it speed, price, quality, or selection. Le Peep is fine, especially for a chain, and offers an interesting variety of items for higher than average prices, but it ain't gonna wow you.

<Content> Mmmmmm. Had the Harvest-something-or-other(english muffin topped with cream cheese, fresh veggies and poached eggs--hold the hollandaise, please!) which was so great! Very fresh and tasty. Not to mention filling. Had a few bites of the accompanying potatoes, not my fave, but I was too full anyway. They had a wide variety of dishes, and many healthy options. My only complaint was the "fresh squeezed" orange juice. At four bucks a pop for a large glass, I'm better off getting a half gallon at the Jenifer Street Market back home for double that price--and it's SO much better.

<Content> It's pretty good, I have to say. The skillets are unique and pretty tasty, and they have some nice lunch options. At least, it looks like they do, who comes to this place for lunch anyway!?However, if you're talking pancakes, there's only one spot you should be going and that's the Original Pancake House. Their sausage is also much better. But if you're into more unique kinds of breakfast foods, Le Peep might be just for you!

<Content> The service has always been fine, and they're actually super accomodating for big groups. I don't think the wait has ever been ridiculous when I've gone, but of course there's a wait on Saturdays and Sundays. That's when people go out for brunch!The Irish Benedict is amazing. Two toasted english muffins topped with corned beef hash, a poached egg and delicious hollandaise sauce? Can't beat it. My brunch motto is: everything with hollandaise sauce, hollandaise sauce with everything.Coffee is kept fresh and warm. A great place for breakfast or brunch in the Champaign-Urbana area!

<Content> If you're looking for something a little nicer than your typical ihop/Perkin's (yet still casual enough to go wearing just shorts and a t-shirt) , then I would suggest checking out Le Peep.They have a varied menu with something for everyone, it's clean and open inside, they have outdoor seating for when it's nice out, service was good, and it's cheap!My friend and I split a Nomad skillet and their Razzle Dazzle french toast (or something like that). We were super hungry initially, but omg were we stuffed afterwards! The Nomad was pretty good, but we agreed that the next time we came here, we would try something different. Same deal with the french toast. Definitely a good brunch place for when you're really hungry!

<Content> Le Peep is a solid breakfast/brunch spot, especially for Champaign. I'm spoiled now, living in brunch-crazed LA, but when I'm "home" my parents often want to take me to Le Peep as it's become their fave for b-fast.Their menu has a nice variety, but nothing too exciting. This is central Illinois, after all. The biggest difference between LA brunch and Champaign brunch? Grease. Those midwesterners LOVE their grease. My parents are born and raised C-Uers, and I have to giggle when they talk about how healthy the food is at Le Peep. True, it's an improvement on most of what you'll find in the area... and true, the world of scrambled tofu and turkey bacon is quite a different one, so not an altogether fair comparison... but it's still funny to me.

<Content> With the full restaurant and constant influx of people Saturday morning for breakfast, I expected this place to be a no doubter. Instead, what I got was uninspired, run-of-the-mill breakfast that failed to meet expectations. I got an omelette with chorizo, something that can't possibly be messed up, especially in the chorizo haven known as Champaign. They messed it up. The potatoes were soft and mushy, and even the toast seemed a bit off. To top it off, as soon as we got our meal, we were given our check. Nothing says "get out of here so we can get more money" quite like that. For your money and satisfaction, you're better off going to Urbana Garden or the like.

<Content> Better than IHOP by far. Basic good food. I had the ham melt without mushroom and tomato. That's just what I got. My husband got the Denver skillet ($7.50). I tried the potatoes in it and they were good. I had the raz ma taz smoothie and it was great. We had a coupon so it was worth the visit. They didn't get 5 stars because their online menu and their actual menu don't match.

<Content> I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by Le Peep's brunch. The dining room is cramped and busy, but the service is friendly & efficient. We had some trouble deciding what to order off their never-ending menu (not a complaint!), and I was really happy with my granola blueberry pancakes. Sounds strange, but what a great idea to put granola in/on pancakes! I like that each table gets their own pitcher of water, coffee, hot water for your tea, whatever you happen to be drinking. I'd definitely return to Le Peep in the future.

<Content> I used to frequent Le Peep. It's reliable food, but nothing great or special. The food doesn't have too much flavor to it, and if you get over that, it's decent.The last time I went, I only wanted to go because I had a free meal to redeem from the punch cards they have. Now, I had two different cards with punches that both added up to a full card. You would think that they could add those two cards together to redeem my meal. However, when I was at the stand to redeem the card, the host wouldn't let me because the punches were on two separate cards. She told me that she could combine all of the punches on one card for me so that I could come back the next time and redeem it. That was SO generous of her. When I grudgingly paid, the host also looked at the signature line of my credit card that said "SEE ID." So, she asked me, "Do you want me to look at your ID?" I answered no. She asked the same question to the lady behind me that paid. I'm pretty sure that asking that question defeats the purpose of writing that in the signature line. I'm not one to even care if people check my ID, but phrasing a question like that just showed the ignorance of the employees at this restaurant.The servers have always been nice, it's just the hosts (and manager I believe) that were incredibly disappointing. I won't be returning.

<Content> I had the gypsy skillet and I thought it was dry. The flavor was good for the most part. The onions were overwhelming and there were too many potatoes and not enough mushrooms. I also asked for my eggs to not be runny and they were. In a skillet that can be gross. I only gave them two stars because that is what I truly feel. I might change my mind when and if I go back again.

<Content> Can't say I understand the scathing reviews either...I had heard good things about this place, so I did what any dutiful Yelper would: I looked the place up, read the reviews, and was convinced that my friends were all liars =P Well, one emphatic endorsement from a classmate later, Helen and I grudgingly came here for Sunday breakfast...and were totally shocked to see how crowded it was at 10 am. The place is clearly a local favorite, and the egg white omelette I had was perfectly serviceable. Maybe August was a bad month, but at this rate I'll definitely be returning for my brunch fixes.

<Content> i took my best buddy here for breakfast today. i have never been to this specific le peep, but had sampled one in indianapolis that was good enough. i figured i'd give the chambana le peep a whirl. the menu is extensive. maybe a little overwhelming. i find the less things on the menu, the better the food. (concentrate your excellence, restaurants of the world!) i ordered the "wheat" pancakes. my friend ordered some sort of breakfast hodge podge called "the eighteen wheeler"..... the name alone suggests impressiveness. she does not eat pork, and asked if anything could be substituted for the pork sausage included in the meal. the answer was no, but for an extra charge, you can add fruit or toast or "sassy apples"... whatever in the hell that is. substitutions are not a part of the extensive menu. our food came rather quickly for a sunday morning. i was disappointed to find that my "wheat" pancakes were not wheat at all. they were in fact regular old un-nutritious pancakes with wheat germ delicately sprinkled atop. sigh. the potatoes were okay. my friend said her meal was alright. nothing special, but nothing to really complain about. the waitress was nice and attentive. she made sure our drinks were never empty and she was pleasant. would i return? maybe. maybe not.

The only slight issue was that the "child's" portion of french toast was exactly the same as the adult's portion of french toast. My child couldn't finish all of it so it had to be wasted due to us not being close to home. They do not have apple juice only "unfiltered apple juice" that they call apple cider. The bathrooms were very clean. They serve Breakfast, Brunch, and Lunch. They don't serve dinner.

<Content> Breakfasted at LePeep on Saturday. Service was good. The pancake special sounded delicious: bacon and pecan. Ordered one. It was okay. The "signature" potatoes were dry and a paltry serving. Other than there being something vaguely familiar about my waitress, it was an uneventful visit. As I said, food was mediocre. Won't try it again.

<Content> Had the seafarer! Yum ! It was a very good price (a little over $7) for an omelette, peasant potatoes , and an English muffin. Good breakfast place after a party at a college town!

<Content> The worst part of Le Peep is they aren't open for dinner, which only gives those of us who work during the week two days to enjoy all the delicious fare served up by Le Peep!Otherwise, I can't complain. Have always had a good experience and their food is delicious!

<Content> This breakfast spot had big shoes to fill. The Le Peep up near Northwestern was one of my favorites. The menu was a bit pared down compared to its northern counterpart, but it had all the usual egg, pancake, and crepe dishes. You can also get flavored coffee, though with a few less options.I went for the irish benedict and a cafe mocha. Both were about on par with the usual high standards that come with the name. One issue was that the poach was perfect on one of the eggs but a little overdone on the other. Not a huge deal, but the yolk mixing with the corn beef hash is the star of that meal. The only thing that makes Le Peep lose points with me is that I got tagged a little extra for exchanging the ever-present diced potatoes for fresh fruit. After corn beef hash, an english muffin, two poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce the last thing I need are these dry, starchy and very overrated potatoes. I'm used to asking for fruit instead, and this is the first time I was charged extra. Wasn't happy about that, but it doesn't change the fact that I'll be back here pretty often.

<Content> Seems to me that Champaign-Urbana would be a great market for an outstanding breakfast restaurant, with all the visiting parents wanting to take their kids out for breakfast.  Le Peep isn't that place. It fits well in the category of mediocre breakfast restaurants in Champaign. The wait times are very long (and not accurately assessed by the staff) in a very small waiting area. Add slow service, noisy atmosphere, and uninspired yet pricey food, and that all adds up to mediocre at best. I'm still searching for an exceptional breakfast expericence.

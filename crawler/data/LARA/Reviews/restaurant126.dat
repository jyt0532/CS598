<Content> We had Hickory mountain chicken and the big dipper sampler to share. The entrees were average and the portion size was good. We were there at the busy lunch hour and couldn't have asked for better service. The real test of a restaurant's service is what happens when a mistake is made. We had a minor mistake on our order and the staff corrected it immediately. I had heard from a friend they had a spectacular salad bar. The salad bar food was all fresh, but I can't say that it was anything special. I felt it was a little pricy for a business luncheon. I don't mean to sound negative, but it was a typical chain restaurant.

<Content> To date this restaurant still holds the title for the worst dining experience ive ever had. Very slow and disrespectful waitresses who like to argue with you when you have to send back your "medium well" burger because it's still red and bleeding. It took us over an hour to get our food on a slow night ... turns out its because our first waitress left for the day and didnt hand off her ticket to someone else.I urge you to reconsider before spending your money in this place.

<Content> This place is in serious need of new Management. The staff is always super nice and try to be accommodating. I always feel bad for them. The problem is they have been out of products both times we have ate here. The firsts time they were out of Ribeye's and biscuits of all things. It also took an hour and a half for service. They said due to two people walking out that night.The second time we ate here they where out of biscuits again. Also cheese, and croutons on the salad bar. Aside from that the food was pretty good.

<Content> SERVICE - too many excuses for issues, drinks arrived during our first trip to the salad bar (order them long before we order entree) 2 of us were just eating salad bar and we had to ask twice to get rolls, they were almost done with 1st plate before they arrived.DRINKS - Specialty drink (summer ??) glass couldn't have been smaller, others were fine.ENTREE - Fish trio was good and good portion, New Orleans plate was also good but portion was rather small.  VALUE - $90 for 2 entrees, 2 salad bars, 1 round of drinks & tip is a little pricy for meOVERALL - 2nd visit to a Ruby Tuesday (always give a 2nd chance) very disappointed and it will be a long while before I try it again.

<Content> Staff was friendly. Food was ok. Environment was was clean and open. Burger is $9-$12, other dishes start out around $12 and go up from there. I would give it a 2.5 star rating. Was there on Tuesday summer night around 8:30pm and the place was fairly empty. No inclination to come back. I've been to other Ruby Tuesdays and for some reason found them better.

<Content> Clean, convenient, fast, decent food, big selection. Burgers are generally undercooked and leave your food swimming in a pool of juice, but they are tasty. The Salad Bar has a ton of fresh vegetables, but not much else (meat, bread).If you do go, try and get Ronique as your waitress. This cute high school chick was the best part of our meal - always smiling like she was on America's Next Top Model, and everything was (both) thumbs up or "great, great." This may be annoying for anyone else to do, but she pulled it off. Big tip.Minus one star for nothing memorable.

<Content> Food was surprisingly good: salmon was very well prepared, chicken was slightly dry but it was not too bad, artichoke dip was good. onion rings were crisp and fresh. Portions overall were on the smaller side. The restaurant is desperately in need of a make over. The decor is severely dated. Above all, the floors were dirty, like they weren't cleaned in a week. Come on, all you need to do is run a vacuum at the end of the day. Whats the worst thing you ask? Service, service, service. SERVICE - absolutely the worst! The hostess did not even greet us. Two? fumble, walk away. I guess we just needed to know to follow her. Oh the waitress ... one of the worst services in my life. no smile, mumble in a low voice. no silverware, no offer of biscuits. did not come back to refill water ever. she realized there was no silverware on the table until after the food was served. So for ~30 mins we just sat there twiddling our thumbs. After oh 25 mins, she comes back and asks if she can get us some biscuits. we nod our heads and out she comes and I kid you not with one and a quarter biscuit on a plate. Yes, ONE AND A QUARTER biscuit. Who serves like that? we showed our coupon to her at the time of order. After a little while she talks to the table next to us, apparently she forgot to bring their soda and she goes "I am sorry I forgot about your soda. I was caught up in all these coupons". WTH!!! When the food makes it appearance, she did not even care to ask "would you like anything else?" "or is there anything I can do for you?" nope ... we had to wait another 10 mins for her highness to come by so we can ask for some ketchup with the onion rings.And you may say ... "well, it must have been busy when you went" Oh no no no ... we went late afternoon, 3 PM, there was 5 tables occupied at most. Even though the food was acceptable, I will NEVER return to this place and sit through uncaring staff delivering abhorrent service.

<Content> Ruby Tuesday is always good.Probably one of the best melt-in-your-mouth rib eye steaks I've ever had was at this Ruby Tuesdays. That was on a day when I didn't have much extra time to dwell there. Ruby Tuesday was hittin' on all cylinders that day.Always a good visit. Always good food. The servers are friendly and some will even play (verbally) with you. My standard meal is the Rib Eye steak with baked potato and butter, with green beans and/or tomatos. I think only once have I had the super salad bar. Which it is.. super.Always greeted in a friendly manner at the door and I think only once have I had to wait a few moments to be seated. So good job.Overall, this Ruby Tuesday is great. I'd say that I ear here the most when I have a coupon arrive in email to get some sort of discount. A meal here for two people might run anywhere between $30-45. With a coupon, depending on which one you use/get, it might cut the meal for two down to $25-37 or so.I will come here when I don't have a coupon/special .. just not so often as when I do.Good place. Recommend it to anyone.

<Content> Not up to Ruby Tuesday standards, greasy burger, dull dry fries, ribs decent but greasy too. Service was okay but not worth $ 43 tab for wife and I, she was not happy.

<Content> Ruby Tuesday is a great restaurant. They keep it simple with the traditional American food: burgers, pasta, salad...etc.Their food is pretty good, it will leave you satisfied and feeling good about choosing to eat there. They have many meals to choose from and all at a decent price. (I sound like a spokesperson)Really great, simple place, and I love it.

<Content> Boyfriend and I are leaving today to go visit family, so we've been steadily working our way through all of the edible perishables in our house. Last night, tired of eating things like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and slightly-slimy salads, but out of viable leftovers, we debate about dinner. A sudden inspiration: Hey! We have a Ruby Tuesday 2-for-$20 coupon! Genius!I would never pay full-price for the entrees we got at Ruby Tuesday. (Lobster carbonara (orig $16.99) and chicken & broccoli pasta (orig. $14.99?), for the record.) The food is good, but with prices on entrees that rival some of the more high-scale dining in the area, it's overpriced. Charging 2.40 each for soft drinks is also a little on the pricey side.. come on, it's iced tea. But with the coupon, the check was just under $27, which is not bad at all for dinner for two. Plus, I really dig the cheesy cheddar biscuits they serve when you sit down, even though it's a blatant Red Lobster ripoff. (Who cares, still delicious.) Our service was pretty fantastic. We were seated right away despite the full parking lot, and helped out within a couple minutes of sitting down. Just enough time to make a decision! Also, our $2.40 soft drinks were refilled promptly and without asking. I love that.All in all, I'm happy with the Ruby Tuesday here in town, and for a chain restaurant, I think it makes for a nice dinner. But my recommendation is certainly to watch your mailbox for the coupons they send every month - it can save you a lot from your bill (but feel free to tip your awesome waiters on the base price, because they deserve it!)

<Content> holy yuck. this place used to be passable, but it's not anymore.i decided to venture there with a meat eating friend today for an early dinner. i usually concede to eating here when i have mixed company (i mean, vegetarian and not) - because there is a salad bar and i can usually throw together something eatable. tonight.... not the case.the server was super nice. she was prompt and friendly and i never had to wait to get beverages refilled..... which was great because the sodium content of our food had to be through the roof. i probably drank 4 glasses while i was there. crazy.the "salad" bar? grossness. i took some spinach.... and really.... that was about it. why? the server who was replenishing the salad bar was not taking the old food off the bar before putting the new stuff in. i watched as he added food to the top of every plate on the salad bar. it wouldn't be a big deal if i hadn't already seen what he was throwing perfectly fresh food ON TOP OF. the cucumber bowl was full of frozen, slimy cucumbers. the mushrooms on the bottom of the bowl were the same way. he comes the fresh food.... right on top. blech.  i also noticed that there were not many vegetables on the salad bar either. mostly meat, prepared salads, some tomato, and a couple other vegetables. when i returned to my table, i asked the server if she could maybe bring some cucumbers or carrots or something -- because their salad bar was conspicuously absent of....vegetables. she said she thought there were those things on the salad bar. i explained the cucumber thing, and said there were no carrots. she said she would go and find out. she returned a few moments later and explained that their "manufacturer" had not sent carrots because of the "drought". seriously?anyway. it was a disappointing trip. i was offered a baked potato for the hassle, but it wasn't what i wanted. i had wanted a big salad. you know.... like a regular salad... only bigger.... with lots of stuff in it.***************edited 12 hours later to say: i spent the night throwing up after this visit. not shocking really.

<Content> If I could give RT a zero I would. Service was slow (waited over 15 minutes to place an order), the order took a long time to get there (we watched a party of 8+ people have their meals delivered and cleaned up by the time we got our food, so at least 30 minutes), the order was wrong (messed up the spices on my dish) and the food unappetizing (the squash side on my wife's dish was the best part of her's).After the check was delivered and I had to sign the slip, the waiter was pretty much right on top of us the whole time. I am not going to be pressured into giving a good tip when the service and food was horrible.Not going back.

<Content> Ruby Tuesdays has great food. There's amazing pasta and spectacular burgers. Their service is great and you get warm welcomings and exits. Even though their prices are a little high, I still think they deserve five stars.

<Content> Giefriend and I were in the mood for a salad and healthy eats , we picked the right place ! she had the new marinara pasta ! it was very delicious ! I had the salmon and it was pan fried to perfection very juicy , NOT greasy. The portion sizes were fairly small as indicated on the menu with FT being fit choices. The serves we're courteous and polite , ambiance was very nice and the restaurant was well kept. cons : maybe a bit more choices on the salad side , the aroma close to the bar was a bit strange. other then those two I'm giving it a 5 star rating because it deserves more credit.

<Content> I'm having to downgrade Ruby Tuesday to 3 stars because of an experience I had there today. I went in there for a mid-afternoon bite to eat. The service was fast and friendly as always. The food was pretty good. So what was the problem? Well, my main complaint is that they stuck me in the middle of a very dirty part of the restaurant, with crumbs all over the floor and dishes piled everywhere. One of the employees was cleaning, and cleaning...and cleaning. Spraying and vacuuming and stacking dishes. It was very distracting and unappetizing.  I don't understand why they put me there when everyone else was seated in a cleaner area with open booths available. Secondly, the prices have gone up. I wanted to get salmon and the salad bar and it would have come to over twenty dollars with a drink. (They are charging $3.49 extra for the salad bar rather than having it included in the entree.) I think that's too much money for lunch at a chain restaurant. My third complaint was that the music was way too loud. I don't need to hear Billy Joel and the Byrds at top volume while I'm eating. Actually, I wish businesses in general would stop tormenting us with "classic rock." I don't think I'll be back to Ruby Tuesday for quite awhile, if ever.

<Content> I went to Ruby Tuesday for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. THe food was very good. THey have great burgers there. However, I witnessed a server using the restroom (#2), and he got up and left without washing his hands. THat was it. I just paid and left. I don't know if this is common practice at this restaurant, but it does bring up big concerns regarding cleanliness.

<Content> This is one of our favorites as a family-friendly place to eat with our toddler. This location has a very fresh, clean, and well-stocked garden bar - which my son loves to sample! I typically get the turkey minis with fries (always fresh tasting and crispy), and of course the salad bar. My husband has gotten steak, mashed potatoes, and green beans - all of which were very good. I especially vouch for the green beans, they have a very nice seasoning and are quite crisp. I would advise against their pasta dishes, they tend to taste rather salty and "casseroley" if you know what I mean. Great service here, too!

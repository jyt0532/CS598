<Content> The burgers are tasty, but they're much more expensive than other fast food burger joints. It's definitely worth trying at least once if you're into burgers.

<Content> I go to Culver's once in a while but not too often. They usually have good soups. Today I went through the drive through and ordered George's Chili (although I don't know who George is) and a side salad. The Chili was good but not as good as "Lisa's" Chili. The side salad was very small but all in all it was a good meal. The drive through was quick and the people working were friendly.

<Content> Great burgers and their fries are good as well. The staff is friendly and the inside is clean. I like how they bring the food to your table. My only complaint is how you wait in a parking spot when going through the drive thru. Maybe they can find a way to be more efficient with this. Small issue aside this is where I'll go when I want a burger. Almost as good as meatheads or five guys.

<Content> Not a fav. They have good Oreo custard cement mixers and cheese curds and that's about it for me. Their burgers are supposedly amazing but then again, I'm not much of a burger person.

<Content> I like their custard, though I'd much rather go to Jarling's for that. The hot food isn't great, and isn't terrible. What it is is overpriced. That said, that's not what keeps me from coming back. What does is the policy of giving you your ice cream, THEN having you pull forward and wait for hot food. By the time I'm home, the ice cream is melted every time. Very inefficient. If I do go, I only go for the ice cream during the winter when Jarling's is closed.

<Content> Culver's - oh how I love thee!! Those butterburgers, creamy frozen custard and fried cheese curds make my arteries scream and my behind expand but my tastebuds rejoice the entire time! Wish we had them in the city, on the other hand, it probably would lose its appeal if so easily accessible!

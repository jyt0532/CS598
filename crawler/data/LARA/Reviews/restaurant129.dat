<Content> We went last night, 7/7/12. We don't usually frequent chain restaurants, but we had a gift certificate. We went early to beat the rush and were immediately sat. The hostess was friendly and out waitress greeted us warmly. The service wasn't bad, honestly. For an appetizer we ordered the Awesome Blossom, the big onion. It was awful. Very disappointing. I had been years ago and I remember them being awesome. I was bummed. It seemed like the onion still had skin on it and many of the onion petals were only thin skin, not bites of onion. It was really bad. I barely ate any. Luckily, the salads followed quickly and they were good. I got the small sirloin with sweet potato fries. My husband got a bigger sirloin and a baked potato. The steaks were cooked perfectly, mine was a perfect medium and my husband's was a perfect med. rare. However...the steaks had no flavor. I had to ask for A-1 and I don't even really like the stuff. Another disappointment. The potatoes were fine though. I had some blackberry cocktail and that was super awesome. Sweet cocktails aren't usually my thing, but it looked awesome on the menu and tasted just as great. My husband asked for a draft beer (forget which one exactly) and he got a bottle. He wasn't thrilled about that, but he was happy about the cold mug that came with it. Overall, the food isn't enough to bring me back, but at least the service was good.

<Content> Well, my boyfriend and his two teenage children went to Outback last weekend, at about 7:30 on a Saturday. We had a brief wait and we were then seated but received no menus. The waitress (who informed us it was only her second week and she was really busy) then came to take our drink order without menus. It took her THREE trips to bring 4 drinks.. and forgot straws.. finally I had to ask a hotess for a darn straw after waiting 15 minutes. Finally, she came and took our order.. we had an app and ordered salads and soup. The app came about 20 minutes later.. we deperately needed refills and plates! NOTHING CAME! Again, we asked a hostess. The manger at this point was walking around.. talking to people and then proceeded to talk to the FOUR hostess standing around. Then, a half hour to 45 minutes later.. the soup and salads arive. STONE COLD SOUP and no dressing on the salad- we ate it anyway. Then the entrees come out and she informs us she messed up my order, didnt tell me but chose to subsitute it for something I did NOT order without bringing it to my attention first. Well, the subsituted food was cold.. VERY cold. She incorrectly wrote down the tempatures of mine and my boyfriends steak and didnt even break us steak sauce after we asked TWICE- again, we went to a hostess.  About this time, we were 90 minutes into the meal and have gotten refills once (via the hostess) and the food was not only terrible and incorrect but cold. We left around 9:30.. no manager ever came to talk to us and NOBODY helped this girl on his first week.. it wasnt even that busy but she was sinking and we were just left in the corner to fend for ourselves. My boyfriend NEVER complains and he was visably upset and we couldnt get out of there fast enough. We will probably NEVER go into the resturant again. Its no wonder its never very busy and doesnt get recent or decent reviews- its hidden away at the end of North Prospect for a reason- nobody wants to go there and get bad service and even worse food.

<Content> Since our little sisters had never eaten at Outback and I have some fond memories of Outback in Seattle, LA, and Vegas, we took the two little ones here.However, the steaks were mediocre at best and dessert was probably its only saving grace. At least, the Chocolate Thunder from Down Under was welll worth it. It was this still warm chocolate brownie (maybe microwaved to be warm?) with a HUGE scoop of vanilla ice cream on top (see picture).

<Content> Went here on a Thursday night at 8pm and it was very slow and we had a coupon for a free steak dinner. The manager introduced herself and sat us at a table around a few other people. My GF and I were very hungry, and about 10-15 min went by and no waiter came to greet us. Very frustrated by this, and seeing this as a bad sign of the service to come.. we just ended up walking out and going across the street to our goto restaurant.. Chilli's, where I've never had bad service and the food is good. To add to the insult, the manager and hostess that opened the door both saw us walk out and thanked us for coming in and to come back and see them soon. I'm pretty sure we were about the last couple to walk in.. it was pretty funny how bad the service is.

<Content> I like supporting local businesses, but sometimes I just want a cheap and delicious corporate steak. Of the family-style chains in town, Outback Steakhouse is probably my favorite. I'm a big fan of the $10 6-oz. steak meal, which is the right portion for me. Ironically, the dish I love the most here is one of their specialty side salads (the one with candied pecans and bleu cheese).Below, I've detailed some complaints, but these problems are rare incidents. I'm usually very satisfied with my visits.While I've mostly had good steaks here, the quality of cooking kind of varies (especially on busy nights). For example, on a crowded Saturday night, my friends and I all got our steaks cooked to different degrees, though everyone ordered their meat medium-rare. Lesson: avoid popular nights and go for quieter weekdays, if you can. Before our meals arrive, my friends always want to share a Blooming Onion, Outback's delightfully salty snack that has proven deadly to one's cardiac health (no, seriously, there are always news stories about America's fatal attraction to the Blooming Onion). Because of its popularity, the cooks usually keep an onion in the fryer (especially during dinner rush hour), so sometimes we get it within 30 seconds of placing our order. Most of the onion is tasty, but 50% of the time, we receive an onion that is still partially raw...no fun.On one occasion, my friends and I ordered a few alcoholic beverages. I bought a peach-flavored cocktail and my friends all got 22-oz. beers (Sam Adams, I believe). I openly admit that I am a lightweight (I usually get drunk off a 16-oz. beer), but I felt nothing from my cocktail, even on an empty stomach. While I can understand the low alcoholic content of my girly drink, none of my friends got even slightly buzzed off their sizable beers. Weird...and kind of unfortunate considering the $5 price on most drinks.

<Content> It's weird, I used to hate outback steakhouse at home in MT, but I've always really liked this one. I'm not sure the service is any better, the food is obviously the same, and I think this one is older so it's not as sparkly, but there's just something about it. Maybe it's as simple as only ever going here with my friends instead of being marched out by my family for steaks? Anyway, yeah, it's a nice outback steak house. I've never had any illnesses or horrific service experiences. The person that opens the door and the person that answers the phone both actually say "G'day Mate." **Shudder** It's amazing what 19 year olds will do for a paycheck.

<Content> Not too shabby. I went with some gift cards, and lowered expectations (chains usually underwhelm this local food partisan) to soften the blow, but in the end I was pretty happy. The martinis could have been bigger, but my lobster was better than expected. The lady's steak, a 'victoria filet', was perfect. The standout was the rare tuna app. Prices were high for what you get, and the ambiance and location sucked, but service was friendly and skilled. Probably my favorite thing about dining at corporate chain hell restaurants is their renaming of standard dishes/drinks in line with the chain's theme. Outback's Bellini is called the 'Wallaby Darned'. Flair.

<Content> Inevitably I end up here when a family member wishes to have a steak. Unfortunately, the cooks cannot for some reason cook a steak to proper temp. It only takes a thermocouple that most cooks have in their kitchen (instant reads only take 2-3 seconds to measure proper internal temp). So, I've given up expecting my steak to be cooked to perfection- it won't be.Went back tonight upon request, and I was shocked at just how salty everything was. And, let me tell you, I'm a salt fiend- especially sea-salt. [Others look at me with disgust as I lick the deer salt-lick- ok, mostly joking here, but I love salt.] But, salt and syrup on my sweet potato fries? A bit much. Salt all over my burger? and the bun? it's a bit much.For the price, I'd say there are better places in town for a better steak. At least the manager won't argue with you that you are incorrect on the steak cooking. [Seriously, someone buy these guys an instant read thermometer...][and it appears the upset stomach around 8 hours later is yet another feature of my visits - this happened last time as well]

<Content> We attempted to have dinner at Outback. Attempted is the operative word. We went in and were seated immediately. The restaurant, though slightly busy, was by no means full or overly crowded. We sat for 15 minutes until a server asked us if we'd been helped. We still had menus and no water, of course we hadn't been helped. She then proceeded to try and sell us alcoholic beverages and offered to get us water while she looked for the person who should be waiting on us. The clincher was when we saw another table, seated 10 minutes after us, get helped immediately. We walked out and as we did the manager asked us how our meal was. We told her we never got served and were leaving. She offered to pay for our meal but by that time we both had a bad taste in our mouth and declined. Dinner across the street at Oishi was terrific.

<Content> Actually gave it another chance. Went back to have a hamburger and fried mushrooms. The mushrooms are great. But the hamburgers...well I have had a lot better... tasteless, the lettuce on it had brown spots, there was hardly any onion on it.

<Content> This particular restaurant only gets 2 stars because of the quality of food they have. But it's about the entire experience, not just the food.Food: just about always good as you would expect it. Steaks are well seasoned (sometimes you can eat without A-1 sauce. Sides are great and desserts are good too.Service: hit or miss, just depends on who you get and how busy they are. Management: Horrible. Everyone who has worked or still works for the owner knows he is a prick can't stand him. I had a bad experience there 1 time (mind you I worked there in 2005-2007, still a non biased review) but needless to say I know the rules. No ones food is supposed to run past 12 minutes from the time it's put in without a manager speaking to the guest. My food ran 25 minutes and he did not want to compensate me in any way, neither come out and talk to me to explain anything. And the restaurant was not busy at all.If you're looking for good food, come here. If it's great service you are after, go somewhere else

<Content> Yikes. Had a horrible meal here 8/21/11. Ribs and chicken with fries. Nothing was appetizing. Chicken breast smaller than my palm, ribs were dried out and gummy, fries were limp and gross. Bad bad news. Beer was good. Service was passable. Management does those annoying take visits.

<Content> My boyfriend took me to dinner here tonight. The food was so good- we both got steaks and they were seasoned and cooked perfectly for how we asked. I also got a drink, and asked the waiter for his suggestion on a margarita- loved his recommendation! Great overall experience with staff and food.

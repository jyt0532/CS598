<Content> I have only been here to eat three times for lunch. The service can be pretty slow but they have decent drinks and most importantly awesome food! I got their pulled pork and brisket. They are very juicy and tender and they have around 6 different bbq sauces to choose from. It's a decent price for good food and I would definitely recommend it. I think it's just about the best bbq around campus.

<Content> A good Saturday night bar. Smiling service, good beer selection. But if the women's bathroom is any indication of overall cleanliness, I would not go near anything from the kitchen.

<Content> Great staff, great prices, and good BBQ. This place is great, it has a nice bar area with all the tv's you could want. A pool area, and a patio out back. The food is good and very reasonably priced. Also when you put in your order it is out in under ten minutes. However the brisket can be a bit on the dry side, on a plus not though their Buffalo Wings are quite delicious.

<Content> This is review will be covering the Hibachi grill, only. If you do hibachi get the filet mignon and salmon or scallops. Ginger salad, with the hot and sour soup. I go here all the time for this and it has been consistent every time and delicious. There is also a coupon you can get for this establishment, usually comes in as a flier. i believe its spend $50 dollars get $10 off or the $25 and get $5 off. Great deal and good food. If you can try to avoid the busy hours, as service falls a bit there.The regular dine in looks questionable and the sushi, at your own risk.

<Content> Extremely disappointed this evening. A party of eight of us were there to celebrate 2 birthdays....one of which was our 80 year old grandma. Once our bill came, exceeding $200, we were charged for a "birthday". We asked the manager as they were trying to rush us out and he said it was for the birthday cake. We explained that we were never informed of this surcharge as we've never been charged for a birthday before! He said we have to charge you for one if your bill is under $100. Obviously it was over. We also had a $10 coupon that they only redeemed for $5. The manager proceeded to argue with us even after we expressed our waitress never informed us of this charge. He then turned and walked away. This is no way to build repeat customers and quite embarrassing to have to deal with in front of birthday guests! We won't be back

<Content> This place is redolent of Elephant Bar: a sit down that's a bit higher scale than other chains, but the food is mediocre. I suppose this would be one of those places where you'd take a business client out to lunch or dinner. I had their sushi and it was definitely below average. I gave their veal a taste and my taste buds didn't find it so agreeable. The extra money you're paying for here is for the milieu, not the quality of food.

<Content> I was really craving sushi so I decided to head to Oishi on a whim on a Thursday night. I was definitely disappointed.I ordered the Pan-Pan noodles with chicken, a Philadelphia roll, and a Spicy Salmon Roll. The noodles did not taste crispy at all even though they looked crispy. They were chewy and the sauce that gather around the bottom made the noodles very soft and chewy. I had a hard time biting the noodles. An upside of this dish was that the chicken was cooked nicely and there were tons of veggies. The Philadelphia Roll was okay. I ultimately just tasted the cream cheese, which is okay for me because I like cream cheese. For the Spicy Salmon Roll, I was very disappointed. It definitely looked like a Spicy Salmon Roll, but when I bit into it, it was completely bland. I did not even taste the spiciness. All I got was a tasteless sauce with warm fish. A few good things:-The food was visually pleasing.-The service was good. The waitress refilled my drink consistently and didn't make me wait around for the check.-It wasn't busy when I walked in, but I don't understand why the food didn't taste better if there wasn't a back-up in the kitchen.All I can say is that I'm hoping this was just a off night for the kitchen and that the food gets better. I was very disappointed in the sushi. So I don't think I would be back especially when I know there are other options for sushi in the Champaign-Urbana area.

<Content> Oishi was just good for me. It wasn't great. The server was attentive and nice. The atmosphere was chill, but kind of confusing. It's like in between romantic because of the lighting and I don't even know what with the tv turned to espn. That, however, wasn't bothersome.I ordered sushi and it was good, just not great. I like to order certain rolls at different restaurants just to be able to compare and Oishi's wasn't too bad. The food is definitely pleasing to the eye, but the taste wasn't exceptional. It was just good.However, their rolls are sufficient for the price. I ordered unagi ($2 ea) and the pieces of eel was really big! I was pleasantly surprised but, again, didn't love the taste. Just felt like there could be more to it.

<Content> ok, so trying a sushi restaurant on a Sunday afternoon might not be the best idea (everyone knows that fish is delivered on Tuesdays and Fridays in this part of the mid-west)...Decor=excellent. Service=Excellent.Value for money=exceptional (I'm thinking of my friends who like quantity in this line). Food...well...variable. The crab cakes are made with fake crab, and are actually delicious, but I wish they would fess up about it. The sushi itself tasted pre-frozen, which in this part of the world is understandable, but it just wasn't great. Sushi rolls were better, so I look forward to trying more of their 'cooked' food!. I wish them best of luck...

<Content> I miss the buffet!I went here with my boyfriend really wanting the buffet that I had here forever ago and I was so sad to walk in and see that it was gone! They replaced it with a bunch of teppan tables, which yeah, that's cool and all but 1. I didn't want to eat there because we were kind of under a time crunch and 2. I didn't want to smell like fryer food (except for I did anyway, boo). 3. If I wanted good teppanyaki I'd go to Kamakura.After I got over my initial disappointment, I ordered some curry. The seafood in it was good, but there was seriously ZERO curry sauce in it. My bowl of white rice that came with it served no purpose due to the lack of sauce, it was a bummer.I will say though that my boyfriends sushi was really good. I totally should've ordered that. But in all honesty, if I wanted sushi, I would've just gone to Ko Fusion, Kamakura, or Sushi Kame.

<Content> Went here with some friends and it was great!  My steak was cooked perfectly and their rice is amazing! Our tae chef was a blast and seemed like he was having just as much fun as us. Our waitress did a great job as well. In spite of a few people in our group acting obnoxiously, she remained calm and professional. This review is downgraded to 4 stars because my beef and onion side of soup literally had 3 small onion slivers and the rest was beef broth. That aside great food, service and the chef we had was awesome! I'll be back for sure.

<Content> I had a very bad experience before I even picked up the first order I had placed with this restaurant. I tried to use a voucher that I had purchased for the business. I did make a mistake in assuming it was for both carry out and dining in, but it was only for dine-in (why the distinction, I have no idea). When I questioned the person on the phone further and asked if he could make an exception, he became very rude, interrupted me repeatedly, and basically called me stupid for not reading the fine print. The initial mistake was mine, but that did not deserve the rudeness that I encountered. I will never order from there, and I am trying to get a refund for my voucher.

<Content> 3.5 starsI went to Oishi a couple of weeks ago for the first time with a friend. I got a half off coupon from some website, so I didn't really expect it to be that great. I guess my philosophy is that if a restaurant has to consistently resort to selling half price gift certificates, then they probably aren't that good to begin with. The menu was a mixture of Asian cuisines. I expected a more Japanese menu, but I thought the menu was just all over the place (which is not a good sign in a restaurant). I got some chicken katsu-like dish which turned out to be pretty good. Huge portion, great presentation, and a bargain with my half price certificate. My friend got some mango vegetable dish, and it was good, but not great. One gripe though. Our waitress was just rude and plain bad. Probably one of the worst waitresses I've come across. She spoke poor english and looked like she's pissed off all the time. For a restaurant that puts such a heavy emphasis on presentation, they should probably hire a real professional waitress/waiter instead of hiring probably a family friend or something who just immigrated here. Pros: good enough food. very cheap with coupons (which can be easily found online). very beautiful presentation. Cons: rude waitress.

<Content> Very good! Never had a bad meal yet. I've been coming here since they opened & I'm so happy they have stayed around! Best crab Rangoon in the area, hands down!! General Tao's chicken is also very tasty! Some other reviews say, "if I wanted good sushi/hibachi grill I would've gone to KO fusion/ Kamakura" my reply to those comments is...really!? This place has everything those other places have to offer & they are just as good! It's also nice for those who want to change things up or don't want to drive as far as the other places. Def a place to try if craving Thai/sushi/hibachi!!

<Content> I am able to get quality sushi here slightly cheaper than the other quality sushi serving places. It's not trying to be exclusively authentic Japanese, it's great if you want to eat at a fusion-Asian place and have your pineapple fried rice, sushi and spring roll all at the same time. My fav items here are: house salad (good dressing), spider roll, sake-tini (they use cucumber vodka, AWESOME!), lao san roll, and Thai lettuce wraps. For some reason I didn't like the rolls that included spicy tuna or spicy salmon rolls - it seemed more liked canned tuna/canned salmon. The staff has ALWAYS been great with our baby - It looks to be a fancy place that is too high class for families but that is not true, and I will always feel welcome with the whole family.

<Content> I decided to try Oishi for lunch. When I saw that this restaurant was located on north Prospect, I expected it to be similar to other family-style restaurants in that part of town. Instead, I found Oishi to be quite sophisticated; a restaurant that probably would have fit in comfortably with the nightlife of downtown Champaign. The interior is furnished with black leather, glass artwork (of scandalously bare-chested geisha...?), and flat-screen TVs. There was club music pumping in the background throughout my meal (kind of annoying/inappropriate for lunch?).As a fair warning for those "foodie purists" out there, this is not a traditional Japanese establishment, but an Asian fusion restaurant, much like KoFusion. There are options for "exotic" fare (e.g., sushi, Thai red snapper) and also more familiar, conservative options (e.g., fried rice, General Tso's chicken). Unfortunately, I've only sampled the sushi here, so I can't comment on the quality of the stir-fry items. My impression is that they take popular Asian dishes and "elevate" them with a few fancy techniques. The presentation of dishes is quite impressive. On my sushi plate, there was a small floral arrangement and an artistic drizzle of sauces (including some kind of Asian "barbecue" sauce and spicy mayonnaise). The rolled sushi was compact, neat, and divided into manageable sizes. The sashimi was cut beautifully, showcasing the color and texture of the fish. I had no problem with the freshness of the fish, either.As part of the lunch combination, you're offered a salad and a choice of different soups (miso, wonton, and hot & sour soup). The salad was standard (iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, etc.), but the ginger dressing deviated in an interesting way from the usual recipe (I think I detected a hint of grapefruit or other citrus...?). The soups, while dished out in generous portions, were forgettable and bland.Overall, I found the experience to be lovely and enjoyable. The service was professional and the food was quite good, especially in terms of presentation. I'm sure I'll be back to dine here again soon.

<Content> Picked up a dinner from here to bring back to the hotel, so I can't comment much on service or the experience of dining in here. The wonton soup was just plain sad with only 2 wontons in it and little else. The sweet potato roll was average. The ginger chicken was quite good - saved the meal a bit, but not enough to get me coming back.

<Content> For those who did not know, Oishi just reopened with hibachi grill areas. We have tried to take the kids to another local hibachi grill numerous times, but that place had restrictive hours and poor service.For those in our area who have had similar experiences, Oishi is your new answer. Hostess staff was friendly. Server was attentive. Hibachi chef was wonderful, and the food was great.We liked the decor and the food before, and have put this on our permanent list because of our experience tonight. Thanks Oishi and to everyone reading, go and enjoy!

<Content> I really enjoyed eating here. As one reviewer mentioned, their presentations are excellent. The soup was just OK, and I thought the ginger dressing on the salad tasted bitter, but the entree and sushi made up for it. The sushi roll was so beautifully presented with separate little plates and bowls for individual dipping. I especially enjoyed the ginger sauce on the ginger chicken I ordered. YUMMM!!!! I absolutely have never had any ginger sauce this good. They added some unusual items, like cubes potatoes and eggplant, to the stir-fry. Surprisingly, it worked! The portions were generous and prices are really reasonable. You get so much food for the money. I enjoyed the atmosphere--very classy. I felt like I had dined "fine" on a very inexpensive ticket. I really hope they stay in business. I highly recommend.

<Content> I had a great time at Oishi! Last night, I walked in right as they were closing. And, they still gave me good service and great food! Everything tasted great and the atmosphere surrounding the cocktail bar was the best! If I could split things up in three I would give the service 1.67, food 1.66 and the ambience 1.67. The reason I gave the 1.66 for the food, is because the portions of soup and salad are small however cheaper than any other place I have been. The amount of wonton soup and seaweed salad was a tease. But, very tasteful! Maybe if the price was .50 cents more they could give a few more bites. I still HIGHLY recommend Oishi. It is convenient for where I live and the building is clean and fairly new! The price for my plate of a 3 sampler tuna rolls, 2 piece wonton soup, and very small cup of seaweed salad with water to drink was $25, $30 after tip. This puts this restaurant in a Spendy range for Champaign according to Yelp. I am not sure if you include tip in the price range. Any input on the price calibration would be great!

<Content> Food is great. Love their ginger dressing for the salad (try it! don't default to ranch or an american alternative...). The sushi is delicious, perfectly prepared. Their presentation is beautiful, and love the china. The only reason I knock off one star is because I feel their wait staff is clueless about how to serve customers. I haven't had a good server experience yet, really hope they step up their expectations of their wait staff.

<Content> Ridiculously terrible service received on Friday evening. Should give zero or minus star if possible. I've being to the restaurant hundreds of times and received good food and friendly service. However, the waitress who seats me on Friday, whom I never even met before and claimed to be working all the time insisted that I must follow her instruction and sit at some strange corner which is cold and refused my request for change in seat (which never ever happened in my experience at the restaurant), claiming that those seats are 'reserved' when I see no sign of 'reservation'. When I insisted to make a seat change, she showed great impatience and anger and tell me to ask manager. I left the restaurant immediately since I have no mood in eating anymore. The waitress totally ruined my evening. The worst waitress ever! She simply destroyed the reputation of such a good restaurant. I suggest the restaurant fire her immediately. Otherwise I won't go and will strongly discourage all my friends go and be treated terribly at the restaurant. If you really love the food there, which I agree to be fantastic, avoid Friday and Saturday, which is the time the terrible waitress claimed as 'always working on'.

<Content> I went to Oishi for lunch twice. One of my friends said she did not like it, but I wanted to see for myself. On the first visit I had a salad with grilled salmon on top and a spicy salmon roll. It was a lunch special. I found the roll to be delicious and the salmon salad was very memorable (I think it was the dressing). My husband had some sushi and a side salad. Something about his salad was off. I don't know if it was the dressing or the greens but it was very bitter.On my second visit I made my own soup. I opted for a coconut curry soup with udon noodles. The soup was flavorful and I had plenty to take home for lunch the next day. I would certainly go back, and I would even consider going there for dinner. I will avoid the salad, however.

<Content> I decided to try this place after a friend told me they had a good experience. I'm glad I picked up an order to go, because if I was in the dining in, I'd probably had an involuntary scene. The sushi was inedible. This is no joke. I've had better sushi at Meijer. The only reason why I gave this place two stars and not one, was the crab Rangoon was pretty good. Although anything tasted better than the sushi. Needless to say, I threw the sushi away and made a 5 stars pb&j.

<Content> Absolutely terrible. The only place I've ate a salad with the spoon, it was more like a lettuce soup (ginger dressing). My mom ordered Pad Thai. I almost told her don't order Thai at a Japanese restaurant but I didn't. It was like a lean cuisine. The quality of the chicken was about the same as a hot pocket. Slimy, gross. I think I've had precooked Tyson chicken that wasn't as gross. The noodles were just straight up boiled and not even fried. Overall, un-edible. I got sushi and it was sloppy and not so fresh. I hate to be a negative nancy but do your self a favor and skip this place.

<Content> Personally, one of my favoriate place to go in Champaign.This place is more of a Asian Fusion than traditional Japanese or traditional Asian.I usually go out for their lunch special. A three course meal (soup/salad/meal) for $6.95. All three soups they offer there taste good and their food is really good. I personnally enjoy their Sambal Shrimp.The appetizers taste really good. Personal favorite is the calamari. I like the ones from here the most.The salad can create some issues. I do admit. the ginger dressing is too ginery for my taste and the salad itself is not too consistent quality wise.

<Content> NEVER AGAIN! It was not at all worth what we had to go through to eat there as a family. I have never seen such a poor excuse for management anywhere, she was RUDE and did not even try to explain things, she had no consistency in explanations and actually tried blaming her waitress for their problem. My family decided to meet here to have dinner one night. Unfortunately we found out how much they do not care for their customers. My mother in law purchased gift certificates for this place on-line and gave them to my wife and all her siblings as a Christmas present. We were all going to use these that night, not on one bill but we were all paying separate bills and were trying to use them individually. This apparently isn't allowed if you sit at the same table, but the manager said it would be OK if we sat at different tables. The manager then tried to tell us the only reason we couldn't use them was because the gift certificates have the same name on them, we explained that when you purchase them you cannot choose what name you put on them, its the name of who purchased them. To try to prove her point she whips out her iphone to show us a laundry service add from where my mother in law purchased the gift certificates. We explained that was completely different than a gift certificate to this place, then the manager actually stated "your waitress didn't have the guts to explain this when you wanted to pay", actually the waitress said it should be fine because we were paying separately. At that point the manager tried to make us feel bad because when we use the coupons they loose money.... The only response to that was: So stop selling them!!! She even had some guy from the kitchen stalking our table while she attempted to make sense to us. The manager then said it would be OK to use the coupons, ran our bill, then decided against her first decision and re-ran our bill after voiding out the coupon. I will absolutely never darken their door again. I hope they lose all of their customers by running them off. Take my advice, don't buy a coupon to their place, if you do you may have to waste 45 minutes of your life dealing with the sorry excuse of a manager that was working. The worst part of it all was that they could have told us about this before we gave them our credit cards and we would have just paid.

I will definitely be going back again and again! Thank you very much for making my sons 4th of July even better!

<Content> I don't think the chef of this place had ever been to a real Japanese restaurant, otherwise, it would be very hard to explain why you could actually taste the vinegar in the vinegar seasoned rice. Even you are a sea food lover, I suggest you stay away from the sea food lover curry. Nothing we had there could be considered Japanese food. Even if you ignore the "Japanese" part, it is just so-so. If you want to have Japanese styled grill, go to the chicken teriyaki place in the mall. If you want to have bento, go to Yellow Fin. Those are better choices in town for food itself. But, of course, the decor in this place is much better than the mall.

<Content> Had a sushi lunch platter. Price was about 9.50... I had wonton soup which was a bit too salty. I also ordered shrimp shumai which was decent. The presentation of the sushi was stunning. It came with 1 shrimp, two salmon, two yellowtail and one tuna and a california roll. The fish is fresh as is the rice...but I don't think the rice is seasoned at all with rice vinegar which makes for so-so sushi. Not a bad place for sushi but not the greatest I've ever had.

The service is decent, but the facility is reminiscent of a Vegas buffet that's been relocated in Branson, MO. The owners don't really seem to care about it as the lot looks abandoned from all the weeds and the stone falling off of the building facade.

<Content> Decor is beautiful nice relaxed atmosphere. Salad comes with your choice of dressing....I opted for the ginger dressing....very bitter after-taste...not good at all. The waiter was not that friendly/attentive...she was more busy eating her food a couple tables away. I got the lunch chirashi for about 11.50 and 2 rolls for 8.50 which was an excellent price (spicy salmon and tuna) . If you don't mind unattentive waitresses then this place isn't to bad for lunch. Dinner prices seem expensive.

<Content> i still like oishi's food... but after eating in the dining room a couple of times in the last few weeks.... the service has brought my original rating down a notch. the hostess/cashier at the front door.... is always doing something besides what she should be doing when i walk in. it's kind of off putting. in three times i have been there to eat in the last 5 weeks, she has been reading a book at the front desk... feet propped up, like we are eating in her library. one time, i stood in front of the counter, and three minutes passed before she looked up at me. three minutes... a short time to wait for a cab.... but a rather long time to stand in front of someone who should notice you immediately.  the wait staff.... sigh. another disappointment. today, for instance, my party and i arrived at a little past 5pm for dinner. oishi advertises twenty percent off for those who dine between 4-5:30pm. awesomeness. we were ready for our discount. we ate, drank, and were generally merry. our waiter was friendly enough, but screwed up our order. he rectified it, and we were happy enough. he continually came back to our table, twice reaching right across my plate AS I WAS EATING to take my glass for a refill. i don't mind the refill. really. it's great. however, i do mind your foreign arm in my dinner plate. i don't even put my own arm in my dinner plate. the check came. no early bird discount. another in my party pointed it out to the waiter. he looked at us with a blank stare for a moment, and mumbled something about his manager. my friend again pointed out that we had dined between the discount hours, and he then asked us if "we were sure." are we sure? yeah, and you can be too because you WAITED ON US. my friend pointed out that he had totaled our bill at 5:33pm... and unless he took our order, served us, and we ate it in 3 minutes... we'd made the cut off. he was still confused, but took our bills anyway and took the discount off.  the wait staff seem unsure about how to really serve people, and some of them are just generally unprofessional. the decor would suggest this place is trying to be upscale, but the service just doesn't live up to it.

<Content> Ambience is fun and eclectic, the food choices are basic and fusion at best. You can eat for $8 a plate up to $40 a plate. They also serve a few fun drinks--with lighted glasses and fresh flowers. The wait staff leaves something to be desired however, and the noise of the heating and cooling take away from the prestige of the decor.

<Content> Guys if you guys did not know about it Oishi has reopened with a new hibachi bars. I recommend you guys too try it. It was a very nice day that i went there i ordered a shrimp and lopster hibachi meal and my chef was AWESOME!!!!!! I think his name was abby. The shrimp was cooked just right and the lopster was good. They served us 3 kind of sauce ginger teriaki and sexy sauce i believe. Epically the sexy sauce i loved it. The chef was awesome and we loved the show he did lots of differnt tricks which i wont tell you or ill ruin all the fun. The service was very nice we had many refills and clearing plates. It wasnt busy at the time** the price was around 25 bucks after tax and tip and i had a drink. We were all very grateful and full. I HIGHLY recommand it. It was much better than pizza or other fastfood for me.

<Content> A concept restaurant that tries to be trendy Pan-Asian, and succeeds on the urban aesthetics but was disappointing with what matters most - the food. Our family of four tried a variety of dishes. One of us (who is happy with rice and chicken wings) enjoyed his meal. The rest of us felt, well, "meh". But first, here is what was good: (1) the beer was cold and typically priced - no drafts here, though. (2) our steamed broccoli and broccoli with brown sauce was perfectly cooked. (3) the food was nicely presented on white china.And now the rest. Our waitress was quite eager to please but was woefully unprepared and poorly trained. The chicken wings were artfully presented on a bed of lettuce leaves nestled on a long white rectangular plate. As soon as it hit the table, my son and I couldn't help but start laughing and what had to be the smallest wings we had ever seen! My other son's "pink lobster" sushi sounded great - but tasted dull and uninteresting. My wife had some standard sushi - tuna and yellowtail - but the fish seemed rather tasteless and the rice seemed to be made of long-grain Chinese style rice rather than the traditional short-grain, and did not hold together well. This is inexcusable for a sushi restaurant. I had the sesame seared tuna on buckwheat soba noodles marinated in peanut sauce topped with nori and some kind of wasabi aioli. Sounds great, right? The fish was nicely seared but still raw in the middle, but the flavors were a mess. Instead of enhancing the taste of the fish (which was not very tasteful), they overpowered it in a clash of confusing flavors that competed rather than complemented.So disappointing, especially considering the prices. For our family, there is no reason to return.

<Content> We just went to Oishi for New Years Eve and I'll admit they have some good service, but its just not enough to keep me coming back. Compared to the other Teppan-style restaurant in town it doesn't even hold a match, let alone a candle for flavor. The pricing for the sushi & Teppan table are great & their service is speedy, but when the food (all the food!) is lacking in flavor none of the other aspects really matter. Neither our rice or veggies were thoroughly cooked (both too hard!) & the sauce the chicken was doused in - without being asked mind you- thoroughly ruined any desire to come back. Best part of the whole visit was the company & we will gladly take them somewhere else next time!!

<Content> There were 5 of us who tried Oishi. All of us loved our appetizers and dishes. No wait. Great service. The wine was excellent as well. The atmosphere was really nice. Not very many people in the restaurant. It might tend to be loud if there is a crowd. But what restaurant isn't these days!!!

<Content> Sweating was prompt. 7pm Saturday night. Room is half full. Music to a dull roar. Not too loud. Lighting is easy on the eyes. Waitress is attentive to start. She had recommendations. We ordered beer and appetizers. Appetizer was the blue cheese chips. Not much flavor. Needed more seasoning. The other was the lime shrimp cocktail. It's warm which is weird. Good flavor though. Menu is burgers, wraps, salads (like ten different kinds), and grill items. Also have a gluten free menu that is a pick a protein and two veggies for 13.99 (steak salmon or chicken). Had the chicken, not a $14 meal but now I don't feel bad about what I ate. Molly had the chicken cease salad wrap. She took half home and claims it was good. Also got fries. She says they had steak seasoning on them. Service was fast and attentive. We were in and out in under an hour. Many tv screens and a few craft beers.

<Content> We drive by Stone Creek on the way to and from work and finally decided to give Attie's a try.  The atmosphere was good and not too loud for a bar/restaurant combo (though we were there relatively early, 4:30ish in the afternoon). The reuben was excellent. The fries were ho-hum and need to be kicked up a notch somehow. We will try a different side dish next time around.  The service was outstanding. Seating was a little too close for my tastes, next time we will request an out of the way table so folks wanting good TV viewing seats aren't crammed in next to us.Cost per person was very reasonable, we WILL be back!

<Content> More people need to know about this place. The atmosphere was great, the food was tasty, and the service was outstanding.The menu consists of sandwiches, burgers, wraps, and salads. I know, the menu sounds pretty basic, but they do a great job with it. They also have a great alcohol menu. I had a few martinis that were pretty tasty. Their beer selection is modest, but it does include a respectful number of craft selections.The service was prompt and friendly. There is really nothing more to say about this.Live music! Yes, this place has live music on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. No, it isn't that live music that drowns out conversation. The volume is at the perfect level and the entertainment can actually sing. In fact, the guy on the night we went was hands down better than anything I've heard in Champaign/Urbana.It was unfortunate that there were only six or so tables of patrons on the night we went. It is on a golf course and it was a cold night so that might have had something to do with it. I will definitely be back and recommend Attie's to others.

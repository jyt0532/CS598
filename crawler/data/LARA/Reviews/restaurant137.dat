<Content> One of the best places in Champaign. It's a great place to take vegan friends. I recommend the warm potato and salmon (minus the salmon and add extra veggies for non meat eaters). I also love the vegan burger without the cheese. Their salads are good portions and are pretty tasty.Lastly, the drinks are great. I love the sake lemon drop. I always request a homemade shandy with their strawberry blonde beer and lemonade.

<Content> I went here last Saturday. The service was quite poor. After sitting down, we waited close to 25 min for our order to be taken and another 20 min for our food. Frankly, I was about to walk out but was swayed by the waiters candid apology. Focusing on the food, I ordered the Thai shrimp noodles. The presentation of the food was nice but for the price the serving size was quite disappointing. The noodles tasted okay but I might have been slightly biased given the poor service. For dessert, I got the carrot cake. The carrot cake was quite moist and soft. I recommend it.Overall, poor service experience and above average food. Given that this is champaign, it is a nice casual sit down place.

<Content> Visiting from out of town and came here with a small group. Nice location in downtown. The beer selection was OK, but nothing stellar - and one of the beers I got was on the warm side. The ambiance was nice, and it was quiet enough to make it easy to talk with the rest of the table, even though a world series game was on and it was pretty crowded. The food was just mediocre. The fries (which were recommended as a side) were tasty, but a bit soggy. I had a chicken sandwich that was tasty, but the amount of meat was pretty small - it was a thin cut (probably half a breast pounded flat) and I ended up peeling away half the bun, which was twice as big as the cut.My friends seemed to like their food (burger, bacon-wrapped dates), but I don't think they would give it more than 2.5 or 3 stars either. I gave it 3 stars because the prices were OK, but I'm used to California prices - so this might be more the norm for Champaign.

<Content> Loved the bacon dates appetizer! And the cheese curds. I had the three cheese soup and the half of Cuban sandwich and liked both.  The side house salad I ordered was fresh and had a light house dressing. Some of of our family had burgers and all were happy with the meal. One of us had the Thai noodles and liked it. We all shared pumpkin bread pudding with pecan ice cream for desert and it was delicious. It is very clean and has a nice atmosphere. Pretty reasonably priced for a family of 5!

<Content> This restaurant was highly recommended to me by a friend and did not disappoint! We started with the Reuben eggrolls and they were AMAZING. I'd like to go back and just get those, if I could! The steak I ordered was perfectly cooked, asparagus and potatoes were really well-seasoned. The stuffed poblano peppers were also a hit. What's nice about this restaurant is that the prices are definitely fair for the amount of food you get. Their homebrewed beer selection is great and I'd definitely recommend the Bela Imperial Pilsner. Customer service was superb and the restrooms were VERY clean! I'm looking forward to visiting this restaurant again.

<Content> The only reason I'd come back here is for the bacon wrapped dates! Those babies embodied sweet, savory, smokey, and spicy. Delish! Omg, I just realized that delish is almost an anagram for Destihl. So shall I say it was delisht*?Too many other things were off about the meal for me to want to return. Too bad because those desserts sound alluring (pumpkin bread pudding!).- It took way too long for the waiter (who said he was new) to come back for our order. Another waitress actually came by to ask how we were doing because she saw us looking around. - Long wait for the appetizers. How long does it take to send over some cheese curds, bacon wrapped dates, and nachos? The nachos arrived last. I didn't time it, but the meal was a solid hour and 45 minutes. I wasn't crazy about the nachos, but the cheese curds were my second fave after the dates.- My bison burger was extra dry (and I've had juicy bison before), and the bun it came on was too crumbly and dry as well. I took 2 bites and ditched the rest of the bun.And the last and final straw:- My colleague clearly ordered the Carolina pork two ways (the entree is actually like 5 or 6 words on the menu, and he read off every word), but what was served to him was the Carolina wings. He ended up just eating it because it would've taken forever for the correct entree to come out, based on our experience with the apps and entrees. Also, rather than bringing out a free dessert or comp'ing the entree off the bill, we were still charged for the incorrect order, and waiter just kept saying thanks for understanding, and "the wings tasting good?" That is actually the first time in life that I've seen an entree get messed up, and it's still charged on the final bill. Wth? I spoke to a manager, who removed the item from the bill.*the t is silent. Duh!

<Content> I hate this place. I have been here twice, and the portion sizes are pretty ridiculously tiny for anything that's not pasta, or bread, or french fries. I got a generous serving of french fries with my chicken sandwich, but the sandwich itself was mostly bread and maybe a half a chicken breast pounded flat. There was not much of the cheese sauce that was supposed to be on the sandwich, either. Did it taste good? Sure, when I managed to get a bite that actually had all the ingredients of the sandwich in it. Also, the top piece of bread was hard, probably because it'd been under the warmer for a while.I feel like they charge high prices for mediocre food; I do like having a spendy meal every now and then, but Destihl is not where I would go when I do.

<Content> 3.5 StarsI certainly like Destihl, but I'm not quite in love with it. I was mentally writing my review all throughout dinner, and it was a solid 4 stars--until the bill came. Don't get me wrong, I am happy to pay for amazing food, but it's gotta be spot-on. Our dinner for 2 was $120, after tip. We had 2 drinks each, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. I've definitely paid this much before for a comparable amount of food, but that was at some of my favorite restaurants that make sure every detail is perfect. And everything at Destihl was good, but not perfect.Here's what we had:--Stuffed dates - These had a great sweet/salty/spicy balance, but the barbecue sauce was a bit too much and a little detracting.--Mustard-glazed chicken - The chicken itself was delicious, but there was too much mustard sauce. The fingerling potatoes and green beans were both good, but not well-seasoned. The dish also didn't come out super hot.--Espresso-rubbed steak - The steak was huge and cooked well, and it had great flavor. Not my favorite steak, but still good. --Bruleed banana pudding - They made this gluten-free for me by not having pie crust, and it was phenomenal. It was the star of the show! I am still dreaming of this.The interior of Destihl is very nice--what you'd expect at an upscale gastropub. Our server was also very nice, but he was a bit new and didn't quite know the menu well yet.While I'm not head over heals for this place, I do think it's a great addition to the downtown Champaign scene! I would definitely come back the next time I'm in the city... especially for that banana pudding.

<Content> Every time I go to Destihl, I just find myself truly enjoying every dish. There are always some really interesting flavors going on and Destihl really does distinguish itself above its competitors, the other sort of new american or gastropub restaurants.Destihl does brew its own beer and it's generally pretty good, always a very reasonable price. You can also get growlers for like $20. Great deal. They generally have one of each type of brew and they're generally pretty solid brews. I got the Bela - Imperial Pilsner - which was great. Good, strong beer but very drinkable.This time I started with the Corn & Chicken chowder which has a bit of chipotle espresso BBQ sauce on top. Wonderful flavors, really was. Very delicate corn flavor mixed with the hint of bbq and given some weight from the just marginally creamy chowder. The soup was nothing short of phenomenal. Must Have.I then had the Farm & Field burger. Really interesting combination of flavors between the lamb and the bison within the patty and then it's topped with just a wonderful combination of delicious ingredients. Who would've thought that combining pesto, sun dried tomato aioli, havarti cheese, soy onions, etc on a burger would produce such an intriguing concoction of flavors!! My bun did come out quite burnt, but the rest of the burger made up for it.I'd get it again in a heartbeat.Only downside, no room for dessert.Can't wait to go back.

<Content> I love Destihl! We have come here many times and always bring our out of town friends here. It's always busy, and with good reason. The atmosphere is casual, and the food is great and decent quality. Our friends love the samples of their micro-brews. From "Smile Politely," (Champaign-Urbana's online magazine) "DESTIHL Restaurant & Brew Works of Champaign, Illinois, won a bronze medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado for its Strawberry Blonde Ale in the 'Fruit Beer' category."The menu has many options ranging from salads to burgers to pizza. I personally love the beer-battered asparagus and beer-battered fish and chips. My husband has ordered the fish tacos on one occasion and pizza on another. The fish tacos were okay. The pizza is good. They also have a gluten-free menu and a kids' menu. Even though we have never taken our 2.5 year old to a kids' restaurant, and she is used to dining with grown-ups in grown-up restaurants, it's nice that they accommodate young diners with crayons to color on the kids' menu. Even the most patient young foodie could use a quiet distraction while they wait. Glad we have this restaurant in the C-U. I highly recommend it.

<Content> The service here was really slow, however the food and the patio is very nice. We were travelling with our dog and thankfully they allow pets on their patio. The fish tacos we had were phenomenal and the beer was quite tasty as well, however the fact that we had to wait so long for absolutely everything took my rating of them down a star. They weren't busy, so I don't know what the hold up was.

<Content> Highly recommended! Nice bar with a great selection of their beers. I particularly like the Nut Brown Ale but there are several other styles to choose from. As for dining, we love Destihl. This time we had the Reuben Egg Rolls which were excellent. I had the Chicken Corn Chowder which was one of the best I've ever tasted. For dinner I had the Swordfish dinner. It has a very nice and spicy glaze and is served on a bed of arugula and other spiced veggies. Very impressive, very tasty, but it was a little small which the server told me ahead of time. Not the best choice if you are looking for a big meal, but a very good dish overall. My friend had the Pork rib and pulled pork dish with cole slaw and potatoes. I was very good, had a nice kick to it. Everything is served with a modern flair and a unique flavor profile. This is not your typical boring brew pub food. Very stylish. The atmosphere is nicer that most brew pubs and is great for a nice dinner out with friends. I am never disappointed at Destihl!!

There is an espresso-rubbed ribeye which I did not have but looked incredible. The dijon chicken was phenomenal.The staff was great. I told them it was my coworkers birthday and they surprised her with s'mores! Good ones! Cast iron roasted marshmallows and an awesome chocolate sauce. Cant wait to go back!

Unfortunately it was a business trip and I won't be back in the area in the foreseeable future. 3 people in my party had the t-bone and said it was fabulous. I had the strawberry and goat cheese salad. Wow! Never thought I could rave about a salad but it was amazing. Don't think you can go wrong at this restaurant. The menu holds an amazing collection of foods and certainly something for every palette.

<Content> The best thing on the menu was the fries. I continue to be underwhelmed by this restaurant. This is my third time, and enough is enough, three strikes you're out. I went here for dinner this evening, I am even writing this from the table. I have had the Thai chicken, fish and chips, burger and fries. All of these were subpar with the exception of the fries. Temperature wise the food wasn't hot and even though I shared that the food was not good, no one ever came to the table to address my displeasure. The waiter was fairly attentive, but the food was BLAND. People often recommend this place, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out what the attraction is. Possibly it is the location or the ambiance, but shouldn't it be for the food? I'm incredibly disappointed and will need to go elsewhere to find acceptable nourishment.

<Content> Once a year we go to Champaign and I always dread the restaurant choices. We like this place! Easy going vibe, spacious bar, everything squeaky clean, good beers to sample and the good variety menu that goes along well with everything. The sandwiches, soup and salads were excellent for lunch and there were plenty of people sampling the many items on the menu... which made it impossible for us to get a table the next night without waiting. So next time when I go, I will make a reservation.

<Content> I came here because their dessert menu had about 3 options with pecans and I love pecans. Their in house brewery interested me too.I haven't been to a restaurant where they offered 4oz sample sizes of beers. I got the "Matt and the Giant Juicy Juicy Mango IPA." I'm not the biggest fan of beer, but this wasn't that bad to me and also it was nice to have just a sample size so I don't waste any beer.My friend and I started out with the appetizer, chorizo stuffed dates. I have never tried these and I thought that These were amazing. The perfect blend of spicy, savory and sweet. I got the Weissenheimer Chicken. I have to compliment the chef on how juicy the chicken was. It was a big piece of chicken and not one bit dry. I thought the green beans weren't cooked as long, but the mashed potatoes were really good.My friend got the Brewmaster's pizza. I liked that it was a personal pizza and they also offer gluten free bread. It's nice that this restaurant is conscious about that.The service was awesome too. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive.I felt like some foods had a spicy twist on them which I think is a nice flavor to pair with IPAs.I didn't get to try any desserts because the kitchen closed. I know so sad because I went there wanting the dessert the most, but at least my appetizer and entree was good.

<Content> Modern, trendy and most importantly, DELICIOUS! Destihl is definitely among my favorite in Champaign. I've been here multiple times and have never left disappointed. My taste buds and tummy agree. It's a good go-to, for anything from dinner to brunch; date or large group outing.My staples for whenever I visit: beer battered bacon, cheese curds and the fresh berry napoleon. If you get a chance, check out the weekend brunch. They have a killer strawberry french toast entree that is to die for. Prices are a little on the higher end, relative to a college student's budget but overall, not too expensive. Staff is friendly, accommodating, and fast. The only downside is, it can get pretty crowded, especially during dinner/weekends/special occasions, so make sure to make reservations!

<Content> Shiny, new, and inviting, Destihl is definitely one of Champaign's nicest restaurants. It's often the gathering point for business events or company dinners, which brings a lot of patrons to this restaurant. There's a good selection of beer that's, judging by the brewing equipment in the restaurant, presumably brewed in-house (and maybe some off-site) as well as a decent menu showcasing modern American fare. Usually, a drinking establishment that decides to start cooking ends up making subpar food, while a restaurant that makes good food has a lackluster beer selection. Of course, this isn't always the case, but I usually don't go to bars for their food, and restaurants for their beer. Destihl, however, strikes a good balance between the two camps. I had a chicken pot pie when I went there, while my dining companion had stuffed peppers. Both were perfectly fine, but nothing to write home about. The menu is made up of conventional American dishes, but unfortunately nothing too unique. You'll find everything you want here for a great meal, but nothing that truly catches your eye. Overall, the service was excellent, our waiter had insightful knowledge on the beer selections, and the atmosphere here was just right. I feel like their menu is a bit too unoriginal to justify the price, but regardless, I'm sure you'll enjoy your meal here anyways.

<Content> One of my new favorites. I've been twice now- once for lunch and once for dinner- and have been very impressed by the service. The waitstaff has been extremely helpful, knowledgeable about the menu (both beer and food) and very attentive.My favorite thing on the menu so far has to be the Flat Iron Quesadilla. I wasn't that excited about it when I ordered (I planned to share with my mom, and that's what she wanted) but I was extremely impressed. It's not your typical quesadilla- it comes deconstructed and has components like bleu cheese and roasted garlic vinaigrette. At the risk of sounding like a total weirdo, I have to confess that I have been thinking about this quesadilla A LOT and cannot wait to go back and have it again! :)The beer is good and the atmosphere is very modern and chill. I'd definitely recommend this place and I will be back again soon!

<Content> Hit or miss for me. Sometimes I have something I really enjoy, like one of their burgers, sandwiches, or steaks. I specially like the cuban sandwich, and the smallest cut of steak that comes with asparagus and potatoes. However, I have gotten stuck with some very salty meatloaf/fish, or a greasy pile of mashed potatoes. So I would stick to sandwiches and burgers.The appetizers are tasty but all high in calories, and pair good with the beer. The desserts are HUGE. I love the carrot cake, which is really why I go back.I like the sampler size beer because their house inventions can be too out-there for a full glass.

<Content> I really enjoyed this place. We had a large group of people celebrating my grandma's birthday. There was about 15 of us so we had our own separate room. The service was really great! I wish I knew the waiters name because he went above and beyond to make sure we all had what we need. It was fairly fast service as well for being as many of us as there were. I liked the menu selection here to. Lots of gourmet and different food items to choose from, not the same old stuff you see at most restaurants. They have a unique twist to your average or popular dishes. Pretty cool.Now on to the food.... They had me at beer battered jalapeo bacon! Omg it was delicious! We also tried the beer battered asparagus which was equally as good. For my meal I got the green chile mac and cheese with pork. It was good, I wish I would've ordered something with a bit more substance (not much meat in it) but I guess that was my own fault! The flavor of what I had was great though. I also tried my moms stuffed pablano pepper which was great! I wish I would've gotten that. Everyone seemed to love their food here. Oh, and the carrot cake is TO DIE FOR! I highly recommend it, the pieces are as big, if not bigger, than my head! The prices were also fair. I really enjoyed this place! Wish there was more places like this (for this same price range) around Schaumburg.

I am not a big fan of their beers, but to each their own eh? I live around the corner, and well.. it's kinda funny that it took me a year to finally walk in the door. Glad I did. Can be a bit pricey for the amount of actual food, but I should be grateful that I'm not allowed to gorge on the goodness of their food.I"m happy to see the diversity in downtown. Not just another bar that is.

<Content> 5 stars just for the Iced Tea!!! It wasn't your average passion fruit, it was something better; even garnished with an orange. The service was on the brink of "too good" and the food was excellent.We sat at the bar to watch the Illinois Basketball game; they have about 3-4 TVs to watch sports. There is also plenty of seating.For appetizers, we ordered the cheese curds, pretzel, and lamb meatballs. The cheese curds were amazing, basically just fried cheese with marinara sauce. The pretzel was also good - a little burnt in places but nothing too aggravating. It came with nacho cheese and mustard. Our server had the chef chop it up into bite size so we could share easily. Very thoughtful. For my lunch entree, I ordered the Dijon chicken. It came with two asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes with sausage chopped up in it. for about $10, i would order this over and over again. It truly felt like a hearty, but healthy lunch option, especially relative to other options on the menu. The price cannot be beat.

<Content> I don't know many people that like Destihl. I think it's a nice, relaxed place to go for different cuisine than you would find a chain restaurant plus they have some pretty stellar brews. The beer changes often, so don't fall in love with anything. I've had my heart broken more than once by their ever-changing menu. The plus side is I'm forced to try something new when they switch things up. Destihl is a nice spot to go to relax and have a drink. They have a small selection of small plates that are interesting and mostly good. I've never had bad service here and love the fact that they validate parking!

<Content> The key to getting to eat here is to have a reservation. Last year we came with a reservation once and without another time. When we did not have a reservation we were simply turned away even though we could see tons of empty tables.Recently we left the game early and called them from the parking lot at 2:45 and made a reservation for 3:15. We were promptly escorted to a roomy booth which really worked out because other people ended up joining us. We had to wait for a while for the other people to show up and the staff was very amenable to it, acted like that was just fine. They even held back our entree order until they got there.We liked the deviled eggs for the appetizer, they were really good. I had the chili which was very disappointing, I wouldn't get it again. My wife and I split the Cubano sandwich which was Okay.Nice big space, great staff and if you have a reservation, great place. But the food is kindof college town fare which the space is not. Too bad as last time we were here the food was better.

<Content> I really enjoyed this place. We had a large group of people celebrating my grandma's birthday. There was about 15 of us so we had our own separate room. The service was really great! I wish I knew the waiters name because he went above and beyond to make sure we all had what we need. It was fairly fast service as well for being as many of us as there were. I liked the menu selection here to. Lots of gourmet and different food items to choose from, not the same old stuff you see at most restaurants. They have a unique twist to your average or popular dishes. Pretty cool.Now on to the food.... They had me at beer battered jalapeo bacon! Omg it was delicious! We also tried the beer battered asparagus which was equally as good. For my meal I got the green chile mac and cheese with pork. It was good, I wish I would've ordered something with a bit more substance (not much meat in it) but I guess that was my own fault! The flavor of what I had was great though. I also tried my moms stuffed pablano pepper which was great! I wish I would've gotten that. Everyone seemed to love their food here. Oh, and the carrot cake is TO DIE FOR! I highly recommend it, the pieces are as big, if not bigger, than my head! The prices were also fair. I really enjoyed this place! Wish there was more places like this (for this same price range) around Schaumburg.

<Content> I have only eaten here four times. All four were great. Good food for sure. The spot has a chain feel to it honestly, but the staff is nice and efficient. I am not a big fan of their beers, but to each their own eh? I live around the corner, and well.. it's kinda funny that it took me a year to finally walk in the door. Glad I did. Can be a bit pricey for the amount of actual food, but I should be grateful that I'm not allowed to gorge on the goodness of their food.I"m happy to see the diversity in downtown. Not just another bar that is.

<Content> Brilliant. The staff was super friendly, the atmosphere was awesome, and the food was spectacular. I ordered the Thai fried chicken. It was literally a half a chicken on top of a bed of some yummy, spicy rice. I loved it. Ordered the fried asparagus for appetizer. The waitress was very informative and was spot on with suggesting the dishes. I absolutely recommend this place for first timers.

<Content> Another fun new restaurant we tried in Champaign! My daughter who lives there is moving to Spain so we are letting her choose whenever we go down for football games and she has been picking some winners.This is a sleek, clean, modern space. There are beer vats as you enter which add a nice vibe of authenticity. We were seated right away at a very comfortable table for the four of us. We tried the deviled eggs app and some gingery egg rolls, we all split them and liked them. Both had a bit of a kick, the egg roll sauce had the most kick and I found this out after I had drizzled it all over mine but I still enjoyed it immensely, I just drank some extra water.Everyone tried a cup of soup because hey, soup is good food. I gobbled up every bit of my beer cheese soup, so light and flavorful. I loved it! With my swordfish tacos I had an amazing iced tea, it was just a lovely flavorful tea with an orange slice. The swordfish tacos were divine but if you are a bit of a spice wimp (like me) you might want the guac on the side, that is where the heat was for sure! I ended up just eating the fish out of the taco, it was just too picante for me! I adored the rice, bean, corn side dish. Just delicious!For dessert, we all split a sour cherry bread pudding and I really liked it. It came with ice cream and it was just smooth, sweet and a bit of tangy with that nice cold creamy spot of the ice cream. I am not a huge bread pudding fan but I think I could become one!This was a very enjoyable meal. The team had played lousy, my daughter is moving, I needed a culinary hug and this was it! I would definitely come back but sadly it won't be with my youngest! Why don't you meet us so I won't miss her?

<Content> Hitting the big 5-0-0 with a great restaurant from my hometown!-The vitals:Downtown microbrewery + restaurant with a slightly hip industrial vibe. Great food, great beer. Best part? Small (4oz) tasting portions $1-2. GREAT service.-Every time I visit my parents in good ol' Chambana they have a "new restaurant in town" that hubby and I MUST try. Or five. This time, Destihl was first on their list... and they are so crazy about it, they took us twice. In ONE DAY.First, for lunch. No beer this visit (hence the second), just lunch. I had the Portabella Sandwich with Shoestring Fries, and it was 100% delish. Also on the table:- Stuffed poblano pepper- Cuban sandwich- Salad with ahi tuna- Clam chowder I heard nothing but raves from the group.Late that evening we stopped in for post-dinner drinks "and maybe a little to munch on." We got three appetizers for the table:- Chorizo & Potato Flautas- Marinated Cucumbers (there's some BITE to those suckers!)- Brewmaster's Pizza (yuuuuuumm)... and all got a few 4oz tasting pours. The beer was fantastic, some of the best I've had. Our waiters both times were friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a good time.One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the story my dad told (more than once) about his friend's first visit. They were a big group, 12 I think, and stopping in before seeing a show in downtown. They ordered food, drinks, then dessert. There was a delay in the kitchen and they were kept waiting on their dessert for quite while... they were now running short on time, so one of the guys flagged down their waiter and told him, maybe a touch rudely, that they "needed either dessert or the check, because we gotta get out of here." The manager came back a couple of minutes later, apologized profusely, and served their dessert. Dessert or check, and Destihl chose dessert. Their meal and drinks for 12 were on the house.It's those kinds of stories that spread your business' name in the best possible way - you chose wisely, Destihl. The guy's been sending over everyone he knows, always prompting with "you gotta hear how amazingly this restaurant treated me!"

<Content> After a long work day, my friend J and I needed some booze and sustenance... and she came up with yet another Champaign winner!Interior is stylish, minimal and dark. Our booth was large and comfy. Our waiter was knowledgeable and just friendly enough. Can quickly become pricey if you stay a while and dive into the small plates and drinks.I was overwhelmed by the drink menu and ended up going with my old standby, the dirty Martini. My first one with organic corn vodka, which made for a smooth sipping drink. Loved it. J tried two different drinks (so I got to try them too) over the course of our dinner, both of which were delicious and pleasantly spiked with liquor.We tried two different apps - the Beer Battered Bacon and the House Olives (our 2nd choice when we were told they'd just run out of the deviled eggs). The bacon was not greasy at all, and the maple chipotle drizzle was the perfect topper. The olives were meh, just not necessary - and I don't think my opinion was swayed too much by the fact that I really, really wanted those deviled eggs!Next up, a la carte soup. I went with the Beer & Cheddar soup, which was close to great with discernible beer and cheese flavors. J chose the soup du jour, Cream of Asparagus - excellent fresh asparagus flavor here. Both soups were wonderfully creamy. Bowls were decent-sized for $5.My entree was a Thai shrimp and noodle dish (I'm a sucker for coconut curry sauces). Nice amount of shrimp, but no noticeable spice to the dish. A bit of a disappointment. J's beer-brined double pork chop was an amazing dish, not to mention huge. Perfectly pink pork.We parked in a nearby parking garage as the lot across the street was full. I would return and try everything new (other than my Martini).

<Content> Occasionally, very rarely if truth be told, one finds oneself in Champaign, home of University of Illnois at Urbana-Champaign Campus and gateway to the high plains. It is one of those lovely little Midwestern university towns where one could spend a nice life far from the cut and thrust of city life. When in Champaign, one could do worse than to eat at Destihl. The place is modern brew pub of the sort that was popular in the late 90s in fleshpots like San Francisco. Get their flight, it is quite good. The Amber is sweet and floral. They serve nice gastro pub fare. I had the fish (of some sort) that was quite nice. Mid-west prices. Sit on the corner patio in front of Destihl, sipping their beer and watching the sunset on downtown Champagne. Good times.(Whew! So snobby!)

<Content> 3.5 for food4.5 for drinksDestihl seems to have all the right ingredients to become THE hot spot downtown, but I didn't leave it feeling like I really want to come back. Service was very slow, but since it's the first weekend of operation, I'm not going to take any points off. The decor was really nice, cosy, and even a little cosmopolitan. I got the pesto chicken pasta which I thought was good, but nothing to get excited about. I tried the fried cheese appertiser, and while good, they also weren't anything to write home about. Overall, food was good, but not great. There are better restaurants elsewhere.The drinks, on the other hand, were good AND also reasonably priced which I did not expect. They had a big beer, wine, cocktail, and martini menu. I tried a couple of different beers, and they were all really good for the most part. They also had 4 oz portion which was a great way to try different beers, and the 4 oz portion is surprisingly not priced proportionally any higher than its 12 oz counter part. Destihl seems like the ideal place to get dinner before a night downtown. Great ambient, great location, great drinks, and good food. Even though it's not anywhere near there yet, I'm sure that it has the potential to be the best place in a couple of months.

<Content> FINALLY! We were all being teased for so long about when it would actually open! I went it's opening weekend and let me be clear when I say this rating is based on beers alone, I didn't get a chance to try the food yet!I'll start by saying that the atmosphere is really cool. It reminds me of a Blind Pig Brewery meets Seven Saints or something like that. They call themselves a gastro-brewery instead of a gastro-pub, which I think fits the bill pretty well. The place is divided up nicely with the bar being it's own area and a nicer looking restaurant on the other side. I have to say though, I was a bit surprised to hear that it's only open until 11, that doesn't seem wise for an area of town that's so reliant on the nightlife.As far as the beer goes, they had 18 on tap that were freshly made on the spot and they were pretty amazing. I was surprised to hear that they didn't have anything but their own brews available, and I worried about how my non-fancy beer fans felt, but then when I tasted their Champaign Blonde Ale, it was EXACTLY like a Bud Light. I think my favorite that I sampled was the Downstate Pale Ale, and the Raspberry Wheat Ale was a bit too much for me. But overall, I think they covered their bases pretty well.I definitely can't wait to come back and try the food (which I hear is truuuuly delicious) and give this place it's 5th and final star!UPDATE!So I went back and finally got to try the food. I believe I ordered the Swordfish, my boyfriend got the jambalaya and we both split some of the beer battered asparagus. I'll say right away the asparagus was the best part, which didn't surprise me because everyone raved about their appetizers, but I never heard much about the main dishes. My swordfish wasn't that great, to be honest, and I'm pretty easy to please. My boyfriend's jambalaya wasn't superb either, but then again, that's probably not the best thing to order at a place like this.All in all, everything was good, and a nice change from what's available downtown, but if I had one piece of advice, it would be stick to the beer and small plates!

The beer selection is wonderful and they taste great; I had the mango IPA and it was mind blowing!Our server Aaron was incredibly professional and knowledgeable; he confidently and accurately described every item on the menu we asked about. I had the beer battered jalapeo bacon and fried egg prime beef burger. Mouth orgasm! So good. My wife and her cousin were born and raised in this area. They proclaimed with confidence that this is the best restaurant in the area I couldn't agree more. Try this place!!

<Content> Oh, Destihl. How I wish you were anything above average. I had a delicious brunch at Destihl once (while sitting outside) and it ruined me for life, because for that reason, I feel compelled to keep giving the place a chance at serving me a delicious indoor dinner that's worth the price tag. So far, that just hasn't happened, or even come close. I might join friends here for dessert or for drinks and an appetizer, but I've learned my lesson with dinner. I think.

<Content> All right, so I've now been to both locations of Destihl and I have to say they're both pretty good, not stellar but a slightly above average brewpub. I tried their Hawaii five ale which was okay-it was a fruit beer that was supposed to remind me of being on a beach in Hawaii. Well, anything is possible it was a tarter beer but still a very light ale. They didn't have their dunkelweizen here which was disappointing. I got hungry waiting for my friend so I ordered the Ancho chips and dip. The chips were just okay but the vinegar and the dressings were really quite good. The habanero vinegar wasn't overpoweringly hot but had a nice kick and the ranch was more than just a ranch dressing. I had the bison burger because I haven't had bison meat in a while and it was just as good. The burger though, was all right the bison, slightly sweeter and less greasy than ground beef was good. The dressing on it though took away from the flavor of the meat but the fries were actually quite tasty. Overall, it's still an okay place

<Content> This is become one of my favorite places to dine in Champaign. Good prices, consistent cooking, good service, and not too busy on Sunday mornings. I noticed some people complained about the prices, but for the quality of food, this is really much cheaper than something comparable in the Chicago suburbs although the portions aren't exactly huge. But it's pretty in line with prices and portion sizes at other restaurants in downtown. The menu is quite unique for the area and similar to what you'd find in a lot of Milwaukee restaurants.I really enjoyed everything from the American Kobe burger to the Beer-battered cod. The textures and variety of flavors were great and not too salty. The sandwiches and soups were also pretty light and refreshing. I particularly enjoyed the tomato soup and corn & chicken chowder soups. The dessert choices were quite varied but i was so full I didn't have room for more than one. The stout ice cream sandwiches had a really nice stout ice cream between brownie circles. It was a perfect way to end the meal.Given the quality of cooking and good prices, I'll definitely be back here soon.Update: Upon visiting a few more times, I still think this is a good restaurants but there are a couple notes.The price complaints I see from some reviews may be due to the varying sizes of some dishes. For example, the thai mussels appetizer is quite a bit smaller than some other items although the prices are similar. Also, the chocolate cake is a giant portion compared to the bread pudding.I'm not a big fan of anything Asian themed I tried here as I found the flavors to be too strong. I prefer it to be more delicate although some patrons may appreciate the bold flavors. I wasn't a big fan of the pizzas either. They were large in size but the dough was too moist for me and I didn't like the flavor combinations I tried.I did like the teas I tried as they were high quality organic tea bags. The coffee is a mix of two Kenyan coffees with a full bodied flavor from their supplier in Bloomington served with fresh cream. The shrimp frittata comes with a generous amount of shrimp flavored with shrimp stock, probably the best frittata I've ever eaten. The cuban style pork sandwich was done well but not as legendary as other reviewers make it out to be. The Potts roast was also done well but not worth a special note. The potato crusted rainbow trout was done well with good presentation but I wish the portion size could have been a little larger. The dijon chicken was moist and flavored well but, the real star of the dish was the asparagus that was cooked and flavored excellently.The apple fritters dessert had crispy fritters but the toughness of the peel wasn't that appealing. If it were substituted with something like apple chips or churros, I probably would have enjoyed it more. If the goal is to keep an apple-like look, possibly fried colored dough is a better substitute. The chocolate cake is a whole pound with chocolate layering instead of cream. This was done well and not overly sweet, a very good choice for chocolate lovers. The sour cherry bread pudding was done well, a little too sour for me but a solid choice. I would've preferred a couple elements to vary the texture inside but that might not fit the overall theme of the dish.

<Content> I love the Destihl in Bloomington-Normal so I had to give this one a try. A co-worker and I came here for dinner on a Thursday night. The place was not overly busy but had plenty of business. I really liked the decor of the place and the booth setup was neat. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly.I was happy to see that they have the same menu as the one in Bloomington-Normal with only their beer selection being different. We started with the Beer Battered Asparagus which was delicious! I was tempted to get my usual, the White Cheddar Stuffed Poblano Peppers but decided to change it up a bit. I went with the Potato Crusted Rainbow Trout. It had wonderful flavor! My co-worker got my usual and she loved them too. We decided to go for dessert as well. I ordered the Creme Brulee. I was not very impressed by this. It was a bit on the runny side and I am used to creme brulee being smooth and creamy.Overall, great food and service! Love this place!

<Content> Man, Champaign (my hometown) now has two brewpubs within a block of each other. Houston (where I live now) has none. Why can't the 4th largest city in the US have a brewpub? I digress.There is a sterile and industrial atmosphere here. One that I am seeing in more in more bars, and I am not a fan. The style does not work here looks like the pub and owners are being cheep. Seems cold to me. The bar is to the left with some tables and booths. To the right on the Neil St side is another dinning area. The brewing equipment can be seen from the Church St side. A few TV's above the bar, but unintrusive. Relaxed, but sterile and pretty much the exact opposite of the Blind Pig. Which oozes uniqueness from every wood poor.The service is fast, but they are not very interested in much. I want someone working at a brewpub to at least show interest in their products. Here it seems they want to shuffle you in and out with a ticket and some tips. Unimpressed on this front. The food is fairly bland and generic. Some pizzas, some steaks, some chicken, some seafood. A little of everything. They do nothing good, but nothing bad either.There is a wide variety of beers available. Including a cask mild, which I would have jumped at if I had seen it before leaving. The rest is about 14 taps in all styles. A blonde, hefeweizen, a scotch ale, a few stouts and IPAs (some imperial), lots of Belgian styles. Though nothing is really that good, and some have obvious flaws.Overall, clearly the second best brewpub on the block. Almost the definition of average to me. The food does not really excite me either. I really can't see myself coming here to often over the many other great beer destinations and restaurants within walking distance. Though cheers for at least another brewpub option in town.

<Content> After several times of driving past Destihl and thinking I'd come to try their brews one day, I finally made it, except not for the beer. I made a reservation through yelp for lunch and was promptly seated as soon as we arrived. Our party ordered the beer battered asparagus and absolutely loved it. The overall service was great and very respectful in helping my grandma get through the doors with her walker. The only reason for rating 4 stars instead of 5 would be that our waitress seemed impatient with giving us a few minutes to order and came off a bit rude when asking who would be taking the check. Regardless, I'll be back for the beer, Destihl!!

<Content> I'm so disappointed. I'm in champaign visiting my sister, and a friend of ours recommended we go to Destihl. He touted it as a gift from the gods. Like so good hat he went there for lunch and dinner one day and then came back for brunch the next morning. After looking at the menu, how could I resist??So we went today for a late lunch (around 2:30) and found the place pretty much deserted. There were some people working in the bar who made eye contact with us but didn't come up to the host stand to seat us. So we waited. And waited. And finally a hostess came and brought us to a cavernous booth in the bar. Where we waited. And waited. And listened to awful terrible music (read: Dave Matthews Band)A female server came to get our drink orders and informed us that Michael would be our server. Ok, so the do team service, I'm on board with that. But Michael didn't come with our drinks. Someone dressed like a manager did. And Michael didn't take our food order. A woman who we later learned was a manager did. I think Michael maybe refilled our drinks? The first manager looking guy dropped off our apps. Here's the skinny on what we had:Beer battered bacon: this is worth a star. It was greasy but oddly delicious. Brussels sprouts: flavor was good but they were still pretty hard in the middle. Bacon Egg and Cheese Deviled Eggs: nothing to write home about. They were small and pretty smoky tasting.  For entrees, I ordered the fried egg BLT and my sister ordered the bison burger. My BLT was fine. Again, nothing to write home about. There was some sort of mustardy vinaigrette on the greens that was overpowering. And the egg could have been runnier. But another star goes to the fries which were hot and crispy and delicious. My sister ordered her burger medium and it came out completely well done. Like "we think this bison is dead but let's burn it at the stake just to make sure it's really really dead." She decided to send it back and so we waited. And waited. And a brand new server (still not Michael) came by to check on us. She went back to the kitchen to have them make a new burger and left the old one so my sis could nibble on the fries. Her friendly attitude and apologies would have garnered another star, but I was SO put off when she came back to tell us that her manager wanted to let us know that she put the order in correctly and that the cooks are the ones who screwed up. Umm... Why wouldn't the manager come over herself to apologize? Or at least to check on us after the replacement came? And also, it is so not cool to throw your kitchen staff under the bus like that. All in all, Destihl has good bacon, inattentive staff, poor leadership, and too much desire to be "cool." And where is Michael? My receipt says he was my server but I don't even know if I saw him, and I fear my tip went to someone who didn't do any work! I won't be back.

<Content> I came here a handful of times during my 5 years in Chambana and had a great experience almost every time. They have some fantastic dishes - the swordfish is AWESOME, the beer battered asparagus is enormous, the burgers are great and the desserts are intense. The drinks are good too. I brought many different people here and they all had a great time too. I think the one dish that was unanimously disliked was the bleu cheese quesadilla thing. TOO MUCH BLEU CHEESE. It's a great location for groups and the service always seemed to be timely and personable. Would definitely go again if I traveled down that way more often.

<Content> We went here for Mother's Day dinner the Monday after. Was impressed with the decor, menu, service, and food. Our service was excellent. I had a Flat Iron Steak and fingerling potatoes w/blue cheese. Steak was cooked perfectly. Potatoes were tasty.Other people in our group were satisfied with their choices. (We tasted each other's dishes to verify the deliciousness.) Portabella burger, veggie burger, American Kobe burger, chipotle shrimp skewers, & chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon were their choices. We had two appetizers - cheese curds & tempura-fried asparagus. Yum, yum.One of our dessertw was the highly-promoted banana cream pie. Good, but the bananas were over caramelized. (waiter apologized).All in all we were very happy with our experience. I hope to take other people to share the Destihl experience.

<Content> I have never been more disappointed in my gastronomic experience in Urbana-Champaign then this past weekend at Destihl "Brewery" (who knows if they even brew beer at this place). Having been to Destihl a handful of times before the abominable brunch I suffered through this past weekend I expected an experience somewhat similar to what most people describe here on Yelp. That being a friendly staff, and decent (perhaps even good) food at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, Destihl has suffered a complete drain of quality over the last few years. When it opened, Destihl offered hot, quality food served my intellectual and friendly servers who were happy to be working in one of Champaign's better restaurants. Each time I dined at Destihl I noticed the quality of the food, the quality of the service, and the quality of the dining experience was eroding away. This erosion culminated with the brunch a group of friends and I endured this past Sunday. I say endured because our meal lasted from 12:30p.m. until 2p.m. The absurd elongation of our meal was not caused by entrancing, deep conversation amongst old friends, or by laggard mastication of our fantastic food. The epoch that was our brunch at Destihl was caused solely by the complete ineptitude and incompetence of our server, the manager, and Destihl as an establishment. To begin, our waiter spoke to our group at a volume slightly above "whisper". He seemed to not care at all that our decently sized group would likely give him his biggest tip of the day. One could almost assume our waiter was indentured to Destihl and taking our orders, suggesting menu items, and assuring that we were taken care of was a reminder of the chains that confined him. After taking our orders, three of which were simply "eggs, bacon, and potatoes" (not worth the $10), our group set off on the marathon that ninety minutes later would end in us getting our food. In total our group would watch at least seven other parties wait for a table, be placed near us, taken care of by the same subjugated waiter, eat, pay their bill, and depart. After the fourth group who had arrived after us was served before us, a member of our group called the manager over. At this point we had spent 45 minutes ordering and waiting. By this point the waiter had been unable to provide any information about our meal besides, "they are still working on it, should be out soon." This information was decrypted by the members of our group through the reading of his lips and not by any sort of audible understanding between him and ourselves. We hoped the manger could provide us with additional information, this would prove to be a fool hearted assumption.The manager assured us he would check on our order and would return shortly. After three more groups consumed their meals, paid their tabs and departed, and another half an hour passed, the manager had not returned. At this point our group decided that if our food did not arrive by 1:45 PM. we would simply stand up, leave, and eat fast food. Finally, at 1:43p.m., 1 hour 13 minutes after arriving our meal was served. Destihl was relatively empty when we arrived and continued to be throughout our meal. Yet, our food took longer to cook than the run time of the original 1931 version of Frankenstein. If you have been to Destihl for brunch you know none of the menu items are difficult to cook, they are largely egg dishes accompanied by breakfast meats, french toasts, or a hot sandwich. Since this experience ended I have wondered what took so long for our food to be cooked and leave the kitchen. I have surmised that the reasons for our hour and a half endeavor are a product of the poor quality that now defines Destihl. First, our waiter did not care about us nor did he serve as our representative in the kitchen. Second, the cooks clearly lost track of our order because some food came out steaming hot, some came out only partially complete, and the rest came out lukewarm (presumably having spent an hour under a heat lamp). Finally, the manager who never returned to our table and only after being called over again offered excuse after excuse before finally saying, "Well, I am sorry."To anyone who has invested the time to read my review, thank you. To anyone who has spent the time to read my review and still intends to go to Destihl even after I have made clear my utter frustration and disappointment, I wish you the best of luck. To conclude, my friends and I will never eat at Destihl again and I look forward to the restaurant that will soon replace it.

<Content> Destihl has a HUGE menu. This is a great place to go if you want options. They've got burgers, sandwiches, salads, seafood, pizza, a bunch of appetizers and more. They also have a gluten free menu which is pretty rare in Champaign. They have a gluten free crust for pizzas, but it is baked in the same oven as the regular pizzas. They also have a great brunch menu on weekends.I've come here a bunch of times and overall I've been really happy with my experiences. I've had two bad experiences though. Once I got some entree that was pretty worthless and one time I had a waiter that continually messed up our orders throughout the course of dinner. Besides those two occasions, the food and service have both been great.Food recommendations:Appetizers - Ancho Chips & Dip           Bacon & Brussels           Chorizo Stuffed DatesSalads - Ancho Chicken Salad        Thai Steak SaladEntrees - Dijon Chicken         Cedar Plank Salmon (If you're in the mood for something light and simple)         Gaucho Skirt Steak (The best option on the menu!)Drinks - The Bloody Mary is pretty deliciousI almost always get the gaucho skirt steak. I've never been disappointed with it! Again, if you want a place with lots of options and good food, definitely check out Destihl!

<Content> The menu has a good variety of options, which is nice. I have had the bison burger twice, but they seem to always cook it a little too much. I tried it medium once and medium rare another time, and both times they cooked it longer than they should of. But it still tasted good. Service at the bar was very good.

Their food is mediocre (a glorified Applebee's or TGIF) and continually is incredibly over or under salted/seasoned. Who would wait 20 minutes in an empty restaurant for this disappointing food?

As long as you're seated away from the bar, it's usually quiet enough to carry on civilized conversation. However, The beer is pretty disappointing, particularly for a brewery. As a result, this place is not my first choice for a night out, but makes for a good dinner in general.

<Content> The food is solidly mediocre; I certainly wouldn't say "bad". The beer that they brew, however, is *bad*. I don't mean "bad" relative to the standards of a self-appointed beer aficionado; just bad. I've tried at least a dozen beers on the menu (I live right by this place, so it's been unavoidable), and they are almost all borderline undrinkable. There is one that I think is OK, and that I sometimes buy growlers of for parties. However, they recently increased the price of a growler of this particular beer *by ten dollars* (the beer is called "Altercation"). I asked why the price had nearly doubled and the bartender helpfully explained, "it has more alcohol in it" and then walked away. (I felt like I was being hustled.)I sat kind of stunned, looking at my hands, wondering how my life had reached this point: sitting in a bar, surrounded by televisions, asking myself whether I should tell the bartender that I feel kind of insulted by the new growler price. All this for a jug of beer that it would simply be idiotic to claim is better than Red Stripe. To the extent that you'd like to encourage Champaign to do better, don't go to this place. Big Grove Tavern serves much better food, both Blind Pig locations are far nicer places to drink, the gas stations sell better beer to go, and Esquire has free peanuts if you really need to be in public to watch the Bears play.

<Content> I had really high expectations for this place...I have to say, I was very disappointed. The only reason for a two star rating was the appetizers. We got the pretzels with beer cheese and the deep fried bacon. The pretzels were great, served warm. The bacon was...interesting, but tasty. That is where the goodness ends. I got a cheeseburger and asked for it to be prepared medium...I received a very dry and very well done bland burger with horrible over cooked yet cold potato wedges. The kids meals are ridiculously small and mediocre at best. To add insult to injury...we paid over $100 for a party of 5 (2 were kids meals) for over cooked and cold food. Huge disappointment!

Everything about that experience was great! The past 3 times? Not so much. We always take out-of-town family there, and it's a disappointment. The portions are teeeeeeny tiny, so order plenty of appetizers. The value is not very good at all. The beer's alright. Champaign has better breweries. This restaurant has a lot of potential - it's already showed that. I always go there wanting to be wow'd, and they come up short.

<Content> I was recently invited to Champaign for a grad-school interview, and went out to dinner at Destihl on one of the nights I spent in town. I have to say that I found it very amusing that the priciest restaurant I went to on this trip was also the worst meal of the trip by far.I ordered the goat-cheese pesto pizza, shared the battered asparagus appetizer, and had pint of the brown ale. The battered asparagus was alright but EXTREMELY greasy, the pizza was soggy and surprisingly didn't really taste like basil or goat cheese, and the brown ale was flat out bad (trust me, I drink a lot of microbrew beer, I know what good beer tastes like). Plus, most other people at my table agreed that their food and drinks were also mediocre. Needless to say, since this is an pricier restaurant, I doubt I'd be willing to give Destihl another shot.

<Content> WOW- I am really surprised by all of the good reviews of this place! I have been here twice- both times for lunch. The first time I went with colleagues and two of us ordered soup. It came out cold and had to be sent back. We ordered the cheese curds to share (nothing great) and I had the Chimi Chicken Torta; which was actually pretty bland. The second time I went, I ordered the Tomato and Bread salad with chicken. By the name of the salad, you would think it would have tomatoes on it right? I had two little pieces of a tomato, wilted greens, and a couple little tiny balls of mozzarella. Not acceptable. I asked the waitress for more tomatoes and mozzarella and after looking annoyed, she returned with more of each. I don't know what others are having that's so great, but I am very unimpressed with this place and will not be returning.

<Content> After three dining experiences at Destihl, the biggest complain I have is that they consistently over salt their food. Hey, what's up with that? Lighten up on the soy sauce please! Some of us would like to actually taste our food without leaving with high blood pressure. The Thai chicken wings were salty. The meatloaf was salty and dry. The Thai fried chicken is a good concept, but again it was salty. My chicken was under cooked. The waitress was apologetic and promptly got it re-fried (nice service). Although I didn't get to try them, the burgers and pizzas looked pretty good (but if you're just looking for burgers and pizzas there are much better places). The chocolate crme brulee was a travesty! No resemblance to crme brulee in terms of taste or texture. Extremely unpleasant! However, there is something on the menu that is truly mind blowing! BEER-BATTERED BACON! WOW! So crispy and thick! Must have! Bottom line, if you're here for drinks, order the beer-battered bacon and maybe burgers and pizza. Everything else on the menu is mediocre at best. Oh, and don't forget your blood pressure medication. You'll need it!

<Content> In my opinion a good brewpub has great beer with good food to accompany the beer. Maybe it iwas the fact that we checked it out 4 days after it opened, but of the 5 beer styles we got, 4 of them were "off". One was clearly oxidized (badly), one was infected to lacto and tasted very funy and the other two mildly oxidized. We hoped the manager would come visit with us, but no luck. The bartender indicated that depending on the time of day, the beer tastes different from the yeast. First time I have heard of that. Food was decent, but I have had better pub grub. Maybe the beer just ruined my taste buds. (Positive) The pizza is HUGE . .enough for two to share or one very hungry person.Hopefully they figure things out. Have been frequently brewpubs throughout the US in the last 12 years and can honestly say it was the oxidized beer and infect beer were the worse I have ever had. Even my earliest botched homebrews were not that "off". Gave it two stars since it was the first week it was open and the possibilities it was growing pains.

<Content> Not bad, not great. I've had the pot roast sandwich and the bison burger. The pot roast was a surprisingly small portion. The bun on my bison burger was a little stale. Honestly, my biggest pet peeve with Destihl is their attempt at trying to create elevated food that just come off as tacky. For instance when I split their quesadilla appetizer they proudly touted it was deconstructed. That meant the appetizer consisted of some tortillas with melted cheese and a side of so-so grilled steak. Give me a break- I've had some cleverly deconstructed items before and that was not the case here. They do a similar thing with smores (e.g. the marshmallows come pre-melted). Tacky might be a strong word but to serve things in ways that are poorly executed and actually make eating your meal less enjoyable and more complicated in an attempt to seem high-end is pretty tacky.

<Content> I was blown away by this oasis of fantastic flavor. The grilled stuffed pasta was so mind-bendingly delicious that I tried to recreate this at home. While the description and use of two sauces sounds like it would contradict itself, each of the components blend marvelously in your mouth.I sampled soups and small bites as well. Over all, I found the flavors in each dish are well balanced and don't compete for attention. There is a certain finesse that's being used in the kitchen to render distinctly memorable flavor profiles. The atmosphere was inviting, modern and clean. The service staff knowledgeable and attentive. I wish I had one where I live and will absolutely be back when I find myself in Champaign again.

<Content> Four girls squeezed into a booth. Cue a "movie" waiter. My friend named our waiter as someone you would see in a comedy movie or sitcom--talkative, funny-ish, and always popping up at random times for small chat. Needless to say, our server was very attentive (e.g., good at recommending/not recommending dishes, clearing the table). He skated the *annoying* line very closely, never crossed it though so hurrah.Food got thumbs up from us: Med. pizza (really delicious and big for $9), Bison burger (fries were a hit), jambalaya, and dopple chop (it was good, but pricey at $20 for what is received). Drink-wise: Belgian pale ale (ugh, no. a bit of an off-taste), torched cherry caiprissima (too much lime juice for me, but my friend loved it), and don juan (nice). Overall, a good experience. But not a place I would have cravings for or feel the need to re-visit. It felt like a safe night-out dinner. Plus you can wear what you'd like, I saw fashions of all kinds without much judgment.

<Content> Reading other comments about the high prices here made me chuckle. We felt like Distihl was a great bargain, but since we are from Chicago, our scale is perhaps skewed. Dinner for 6 for $100 made this place fantastic for the price. Granted we were not drinking, but still. The cassoulet was very good, if light on the promised sausage. We will go back next time we are in town.

<Content> Okay, first of all, credit where credit is due: There are some delicious appetizers on the menu, and desserts are HUGE and great for splitting. My husband and I have been here a few times, and we both really like the potato croquettes (mmm, chimichurri) and the marinated cucumber salad. Both have a spicy bite -- definitely recommended. The rest of the food is okay. Pizzas are decent, the salads seem to rely a lot on the dressings, similarly so with the sandwiches. Service is good and friendly, although can come down a little on the overwhelmingly chatty side. Still, in a place as big as this one, it's nice to not feel like you've gotten lost or abandoned.Unfortunately, I can't recommend much else. The design and marketing of Destihl gives off a very artisanal vibe, particularly in their choice of "craft beer," but their beers are at best uneven and at worst anemic shadows of what they could be. Most recently, I was disappointed in the pumpkin porter, which sounds like it should be layered and spicy and complex. Mostly, it was bitter and I could only taste the pumpkin if I really thought about it. I've felt similarly about all of their beers that I have tried, although a few are okay (the Hefeweizen, the Tripel). I want to be seduced by the delicious descriptions (and oh, they DO have a good writer), but I just can't.This place reads to me as a large chain that wants to be a small, careful, art-and-ingredient-driven restaurant, but it doesn't get there. It's confusing. 2 1/2 stars, rounding down.

<Content> I really was not expecting to give a brewpub 5 stars...but here goes...We went on a Monday night, and the restaurant was FULL which was A) good to see for a new business and B) surprising! The decor is surprisingly upscale - really cool use of natural stone and wood. HUGE shame they didn't open with their patio ready to go, but when I inquired they said it was in the plans to open the patio soon.The beers (I tried 5, yup 5) were decent - not world-class, but decent. My favorite purely for summer drinkability was the Champaign Blonde, but I am admittedly not into dark beers at all, and there are PLENTY of dark ones and heavier Begian-style ales which I didn't try.The menu looked surprisingly interesting, (I was expecting burgers and pretzels), and between us we tried the pickled cucumber salad, the tuna carpaccio, the strawberry salad and the warm salmon and potato salad. All four dishes were winners, although the small plates ARE really small (which is exactly what we wanted). The entrees are MASSIVE for the price, and look like they are high quality meals, but I'm glad we saw how big they were before we ordered one!Service was excellent from beginning to end.The desserts also looks amazing, but I was too full to try. As a gay couple it was nice to feel comfortable and that there was a real mix of clientele - I was scared it was going to be exclusively Olive Garden-goers, but there were some hipsters, some queens, and some students as well as your typical 'casual-dining' crowd.Can't wait for the patio to open, but believe me, there will be a serious wait time on those tables - be prepared!

My friend and I arrived a little after 7 on a Friday night and was told the wait would be about 40 minutes since we didn't have reservations. No problem. After only about 20-25 minutes our pager buzzed, so score! So far so good. Our server was really nice and attentive, nothing negative to say about him. However, the food is another story.We started with the cheese curds for an appetizer. And these were awesome, plus they give you a lot. The only part of the meal that really stood out, sadly. I'd had my eye on the strawberry goat cheese salad, so I got that and split the pesto goat cheese pizza. The salad had a lot of potential with all the seemingly good ingredients, but was just off. The spinach tasted wrong and it would have been much better with mixed greens. The "strawberry" part of the salad consisted of maybe three tiny pieces and the goat cheese wasn't even very good. It mainly was made up of mandarin oranges and ill-tasting spinach.I'm not a huge fan of wood-fired pizza (I prefer almost any other type of crust). My friend and I split a pizza, but I saw plenty of people putting one away all by themselves. It is very thin. The toppings were ok, but I didn't like how the goat cheese was in big globs instead of spread over the whole pizza.We left without getting dessert, but I saw a few and they are possibly the biggest desserts I've ever seen anywhere. This isn't a good thing. Probably 3-4 people should be splitting on dessert, but I'm guessing that doesn't happen that often. So just be aware if you do order that piece of cake.Besides the service, the other positive is the price. Everything is fairly cheap. But that coincides with the quality, so just beware.

<Content> The Hubster and I decided to do a date night--try out Destihl and then go see The Exorcist at the Virginia (our date night may not be your definition of 'romantic,' but that's neither here nor there). I'd heard about how crowded Destihl gets around dinnertime, and never having been there before, I went the AARP-route and reserved a table for us at 5:15 to give ample time for slow service (this was unnecessary). I was surprised to learn that Destihl is cavernous. There was absolutely no shortage of tables. How does it ever get crowded? Who knows? In any case, we were (irritatingly) seated near the only large, loud party in the entire restaurant. Nothing like listening to a bunch of screechy teenagers dressed up for Homecoming say semi-racist things and then shush each other on date night!We got appetizers and small plate-y things to constitute our meal. All were finger food, all were messy and delicious. We tried the cheese curds (lightly breaded, crunchy, thoroughly melty), thai chicken wings (a nicely spicy slow burn, flavorful, thick sauced with fabulous peanuts sprinkled over the top), and beer-boiled shrimp (a tad too much seasoning that clung to our fingers and overwhelmed most other flavors, not much beer taste, but otherwise...you know...cold shrimp are tasty on their own). I tried a pint of their black IPA which I thoroughly enjoyed. We also shared their chocolate trio (or Mnage  Trois or whatever they call it), which consisted of mexican hot chocolate (thick, hot, nom), a chocolate tart (delicious filling, but with a crust that was absolutely impossible to cut into, making it awkward to eat, much less share), and zanzibar chocolate ice cream (heaven). I need to try more things to be sure that this is actually a problem, but I feel like everything on their menu is too complicated. There are SO MANY INGREDIENTS listed on every single menu item. Too many seasonings, too many flavor combinations. Every time I read something, I was like, "Mmm...yes...yes...yes!...oh, no, you went too far."Our waiter was extremely enthusiastically friendly to the point of making us feel a bit awkward. I mean, he hung out and chatted. I don't harbor ill will against the guy or anything--he was really nice!--but you know...I'm on a date with my main squeeze...please leave.Considering all the stuff we got, our tab was surprisingly cheap. I think we were out for under $30. I waffled between 3.5 and 4 stars, but I'm feeling generous today.

<Content> They have good food options. They could work more on the vegetarian options. Nice beer. Some people may like this, but I personally don't like waiters coming back every 10-15 mins asking how the food is and if everything is okay. But I understand that they are trained to do the same.

<Content> Destihl is an upscale pub-style restaurant with a low key atmosphere. The menu is quite large and has a lot of variety from small tapas style plates, to salads, pizzas, burgers, steaks, entrees, and even some thai-fusion style dishes. Because of the variety, I think this is a great place to bring a group or a date if you're not sure what type of food they prefer. The beer is all brewed at Destihl and is decent, but I've never been blown away by any of their brews. I have been here several times and my favorite dish so far was the Cedar Plank Salmon. On my most recent trip I ordered the Kobe Burger and when I ran out of sauce, the server asked if I would like more.  I am not a dessert person, but I LOVE their dessert menu. So, do yourself a favor and save room for dessert!Be warned, if you sit in the bar area be prepared to wait. I have actually left a few times when I haven't been given water or a menu 15 minutes after arriving. If you sit in the main dining room however, the service is superb.

<Content> Destihl-ness is the move! They've only been open a few weeks but I'm predicting that this place is going to become an institution here in Champaign-Urbana. They're not quite there yet, BUT this four stars is partially based on potential. I don't know if that's acceptable for Yelp, but whatever.I will admit I got a little gluttonous this evening. Ideally, I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did, but it was what it was. I started off with some of the home brews. I did the the little 4 oz guys and out of the four I tried, I liked three enough to drink again (the Belgian ale was a bit too hoppy for my liking). At $1.25 each (or $5 for the 4), I don't mind one I didn't like.Next I went with the beer-cheese soup. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT. It was amazingly good. Also, at my table were some cheese curds and I will dare say that these curds were the finest curds I have ever eaten (and I've had them in Wisconsin too). For my entree, I went with the bison burger which was flavorful - although I will echo the review who noted that their meat was overcooked - and I appreciated that fries were included. The fries were awesome - shoestring style and were not oversalted, but weren't seasoned improperly either (just right!).For dessert it was baked apples with butter pecan ice cream. It was wildly decadent and irresponsibly delicious. The service is not awful but you can tell that the servers are still getting their feet wet. No worries though. The food was totes worth the wait. I'll be back no doubt and I'm pretty sure I'll be updating with 5 stars.

<Content> Beer is pretty good.  I'm not normally impressed with the offerings of small brewpubs, but this place is OK.  Liked every beer I was served.Appetizers were good.  I enjoyed the bacon-wrapped dates.Things fell apart a bit when it came to our main meal.  My hamburger was overcooked and uninteresting.  No condiments for my sandwich.  And waitstaff sorta evaporated once our food was delivered.This is a restaurant I would visit to sit at the bar and enjoy beer and snacks.  But for lunch or dinner, I'd take my meal elsewhere.

<Content> Huge fan of this place! My fiance and I made last minute reservations here on Christmas Eve...we had a GREAT waitress, can't remember her name...who understood we wanted to move quick so we could catch Mission Impossible (which would only get about 2 stars, by the way).We ordered the flat bread (I'm obsessed with truffle oil), one of their specialty pizzas and a Greek salad to share. We were impressed with ALL of it. Flat bread was good if you're in the mood for starchy foods--the pizza had a very thin crust, which I loved, so you could eat more of the toppings...and the salad was HUGE for its small price.We tasted several of the beers and ended up getting a growler to go because we loved it so much.Decor was a bit industrial, and very contemporary, especially for the Midwest. We will definitely return and bring friends!

<Content> Super excited this place is finally open. Not only that, but it was just as good as I had hoped it would be. Tons of good things to say about the place, but I'll start with the two negatives so we can get that out of the way.The waitress heard me say cheese pizza instead of goat cheese pizza. Probably my fault actually, because it was loud and I am a self-proclaimed mumbler. This mistake was fixed promptly and the pesto goat cheese pizza was awesome. Second problem was that the fried asparagus was somewhat whelming. It was really big, so if you're going for size great, but smaller spears aren't woody textured like the big spears. I assume that since they specify they use local when they can, that this problem will remedy itself once asparagus comes into season in a few weeks around here.Now for the mega good stuff:Deadhead double red is probably THE BEST red ale I've ever had. It is strong, spicy, flavorful and full bodied. Just wonderful! Everyone at my table liked their other flavors (and we went with some beer snobs ;) The hubby loved, loved, loved the coffee glazed rib-eye. Service was surprisingly good granted that it was the first weekend they were open. The people getting bad service in the other review...sorry, we must've been hogging all the attention ;). We actually liked the place so much we went back for brunch on the next day. Which was even. more. amazing.Ordered the swordfish tacos (see pics) and Cuban sandwich, and the french toast (see pics) for the munchkin. The kids French toast was ridiculously awesome. Here's the most awesome kicker- we were with a big group with 4 kids and the back room was open, so they gave it to us to have our brunch back there so the kids wouldn't bother anyone else. It was an awesome experience and the whole staff was soooo super nice. Make sure to check out my food pics- the kids meal was 1/3 eaten when I took the pic, but you can imagine the thrill in junior's eyes when he saw what he got for breakfast! :)Awesome place guys! Keep up the good work!

<Content> Utterly fantastic food. The chef is a genious on par with any of the best restaurants in town, but at a lower price than some of the more expensive competition. Not as nice of an atmosphere as some of the fine-dining restaruants like Jim Gould's and Silvercreek, but every bit as tasty. Destihl is going to have a great impact on downtown.Also, while I'm not a beer person, the people I ate with said the beer is an excellent local micro-brew. Perhaps not amazing, but just as much as any reasonable person could hope for.Also, they do have a meeting/conference room with a large table and an LCD TV.

<Content> My family and I absolutely LOVE Destihl! It has become the go-to place whenever my parents visit (I am in law school).The first time we went there, I was pleasantly surprised to see how many options were available for myself because I am an ovo-lacto vegetarian. Usually I have to settle for something bland or uninteresting, but Destihl has lots of imaginative and delicious options. We started with the beer-battered asparagus which was pretty tasty. I ordered the stuffed pablano which was absolutely amazing. It was spicy and had a really interesting mix of flavors. My mom got the Thai fried chicken and my dad got the ribeye, which they both loved. My boyfriend got the bison burger which he thought was good but not as amazing as our dishes. The second time we went was for lunch. I got the lunch combo with the portabella and brie sandwich and the beer and cheddar soup. The sandwich was yummy but the soup was really very delicious. Definitely comfort food and really hit the spot. My mom got the Thai fried chicken again and my dad got the Thai steak which he said was even better than the ribeye. My boyfriend ordered the Dijon chicken which he really enjoyed.You should probably make a reservation for dinner but likely do not need one for lunch. They also serve brunch on the weekends until 2:00 and those items looked pretty delicious as well. We have had great servers at Destihl and the restaurant has a nice ambiance. Plus, they don't have a corkage fee! The first time we went, we brought our own bottle of wine and there was no charge! All in all we have had really great meals here and will definitely be returning!

<Content> Great restaurant! I have been here twice now and enjoyed everything I've had. Visit #1: Tried a few beers before selecting one. The drafts come in three sizes, which is really nice. My friends and I got the pretzels with cheese and mustard dipping sauces, and LOVED them. I got the bison burger with fries and had to stop myself from eating the whole thing before my stomach exploded! Great wait staff and a very classy atmosphere.Visit #2: Another great beer experience. Got a pizza this time, which was pleasantly adequate for a one person dinner. It was thin and crispy, but not crunchy...just the way I like it! We sat at a window near the bar and watched downtown during sunset, which was really nice. I like the corner location...lots of natural light!Will definitely consider coming here whenever I want to eat downtown. Reasonably priced for the quality, and a great overall dining experience.

<Content> I have gone multiple times and my parents pretty much live here. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable on what they have and they are super friendly! I love trying new things and I am never disappointed. My dad has helped them with a batch of beer, they have made Reese's vodka just for my mom and honestly, whenever I go with them to eat it's like I walk onto the set of Cheers. Everybody knows their name. But you don't have to be a regular to feel like you're getting special treatment. I love that they bring you samples of their beer or tell you what just became available after aging. I love the location, I love the feel... I just wish I had more money so I could visit them more often!

<Content> I've been here a few times. I like it for lunch.  Their beer is alright. The flatbread-y pizza with lemon and arugula was delicious. I have it on good authority that their portobello sandwich is better than The Bread Company. I think the dinner - both the crowds and the food - are a little pretentious. My BF thinks that this is "a great place for women who shop at Chicos to meet up with each other and discuss the braided leather belts they bought for their husbands." Which is to say, he thinks they overdo atmosphere to keep the rif raff out. In my experience, I will sacrifice dim lighting for a chile that is actually spicy. Oh, midwestern restaurants. Are you using bell peppers to make Chile Rellenos? My littlest brother really liked it, though. He devoured some friend bacon appetizer.

But one thing is 1000% worth getting: Beer Battered Asparagus. That's it. Who cares if you have stinky pee from eating asparagus - totally worth it.

<Content> Passing through town and stopped in Champaign for the night. This place was recommended to me by the front desk clerks at my hotel. If you are a craft beer enthusiast you should definitely stop in. It is definitely worth the short drive even if you are staying by the highway in Motel Hell. I arrived early and was seated promptly at a table in view of a big screen TV near the bar area. My server was knowledgable and attentive. I had a flight of three craft beers, guided by my server. As an appetizer, I had the mac and cheese. Loved it and managed to avoid eating it all so I could take some back to my room. For an entree, I had the salmon over a bed of roasted vegetables. This was also quite good. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse, which is accented by a topping of cinnamon-coated maple bacon (amazing) and mint. This was also good but could be more chocolatey, IMHO. If I lived in the area I would dine here regularly. If you are a visitor, do yourself a favor and avoid the generic chain places by the highway, and drive into town to go here instead.

<Content> OK, if it wasn't for the weird service we experienced, this would totally be 5 stars. At first, our server spent a lot of us time with us going over all the different beers and was super knowledgeable and basically just a really good server. Halfway into dinner he disappeared and other people started bringing us our food. When we asked where he was, we were told that he was in the back doing other things. At the end of dinner he returned to being our server but also bartender so we were basically ignored. Very weird service.We tried 11 of the 14 beers they make. I personally like really hoppy beers, but alas I can't remember the names of the ones I liked. For appetizers we ordered the chorizo stuffed dates, which were AMAZING! We also ordered lamb meatballs. I love anything with goat cheese so both of these appetizers were right up my alley. In the past, I have also gotten beer battered asparagus which is also super delicious.Originally, I ordered the pesto and goat cheese pizza but unfortunately it was very soggy and my plate was drenched in grease. Even the server commented that it was excessively soggy. I sent it back, which is something I NEVER do. I then ordered the flat iron quesadillas from the appetizers as my dinner. It didn't disappoint. My favorite part was definitely the chorizo stuffed dates.

I'd like to think someone over there read my posts ;) I'm still not a fan of the price points but the food is far more consistent and seems to be better quality. Also really enjoy their coffee and fresh cream after any meal there. Still nothing terribly interesting however everything seems fresh and well executed. Also I am trying to tone down on being such a food snob so... 4 stars!! (throws confetti sarcastically)

<Content> After waiting years for this to finally open (and moving 2 years ago) I finally tried it out on my way back to St. Louis from the Chicago area. It was after 2 pm, so no idea how things are during peak times. I liked the atmosphere, although the AC was at arctic levels. I enjoyed my food and drink, but since I was traveling, I just got a sampler of the Altercation (a good compromise between light and dark), and the spinach salad (enjoyed the maple bacon dressing) and the Cuban Pork. Recommended stop in downtown Champaign - in the large condo tower on Neil in downtown. There's a gigantic parking deck behind it, or metered parking in the city lot across the street, where there are 2 Zipcars stationed. Good move, Champaign.

<Content> I've been to Desthil a couple times, and it's pretty nice. The burgers are really good, as are the Cuban sandwiches. I was also fond of the house drafts that I tried (including an apricot beer that's one of my favorite Belgians). The beers they brew onsite are all really good. The dessert menu is also fantastic- try the chocolate cake that's the size of your head if you're looking for diabetes. The Smores plate is also fun.All that said, the food here is a bit more expensive than it's worth. Burgers are cheaper (and better) at Farren's, Radio Maria has better Cubans for the price and the entrees are nothing too impressive- good, but not great. I've also found service to be a bit hit or miss- we've had waiters that have been remarkably friendly and courteous, but last time they substituted a more expensive glass of wine for one they apparently didn't have without telling us. I like going here, and it's a nice change of pace every once in a while, but rarely do I go "Boy, we need to go to Desthil."

He knew quite a bit about drinks, their beers, and the menu.He was attentive and answered all our questions patiently. Patience is a virtue to a bar customer because time is money for them, and I get that.The only thing I remember ordering was the deep fried bacon. MMMMMMMM It had a bit of spice to it and they were great...just taxing on the tummy 30 minutes after eating it. Sooooo much grease - but aren't things better that way?Lots of interesting menu choices and in house brewed beers (which I didn't have)Hope you try them.

I loved my cocktails, which include the Vanilla and Mint, Dark and Stormy, and the Aztec Chocolate. The last one was amazing - it had a spicy kick to it.

That's a-okay in my book. one last thing... what's up with the waiters? ALL of them! They've all got the personalities of awkward engineers. I actually was so certain our waiter was an awkward engineer that I asked him if he was a student at U of I. Imagine my surprise when he said he studied library sciences.

<Content> Destihl was something that was completely unexpected for me to find in downtown Champaign. It was a MUCH bigger place than I anticipated, and I would love to see it on a day when it was busy. We were there about 3pm on a Monday. I was immediately impressed with the vibe of the place - very hip, and something you would expect to find in any major city's downtown. The beer list was posted on a board above the bar and was HUGE for a local microbrewery. Where I expected to find 8-10 local beers supported by a smattering of other regional brews, the list of beers brewed in house was closer to 20-25. As I had never been to Destihl, I asked the bartender to select 4 beers for me to sample (this is typical practice for me -- a good bartender will ask the right questions and figure out what you like). He started by asking if I wanted darker or lighter beer, and then asked me about some different flavor profiles. After a few questions, he came back with four delicious beers. I tried the Roadblock British Red Ale, Black Angel Stout, Deadhead Double Red, and Antiquity Rye Wine. All were really awesome.I was very pleased with the bartenders knowledge of the beer, the fast friendly service, and the atmosphere in general.Next time I'm in town this is DEFINITELY a place I plan to return, and hopefully next time I'll get to order some food as well.

<Content> I had heard about this place about 6 months before I tried it out, and I'm mad at myself for missing out for so long. The food is affordable for a student on a budget, and the atmosphere is perfect for a date or group outing. It's the perfect place for students to bring their visiting parents, too.The beer comes in sizes ranging from 4oz to 16oz, so you can try different brews if you're in the mood for that. The Tomato & Bread salad is absolutely phenomenal, and I have added chicken to it and had that as my entree on more than one occasion. This is one restaurant I really miss since graduating U of I and leaving the area.

I enjoy having the direct interaction with the team of wonderfully skilled bartenders. Their attention to detail and good cheer make the bar a must for anyone I take out in Champaign. The roasted peanuts covered in delectable spices and drizzled with fresh lime juice make the perfect accoutrement to the always great, fresh beer; the bbq burger is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.

<Content> We've been to Destihl maybe six times now, for brunch, lunch, and dinner. Most of the food is very good, better conceived and made than a lot of other area restaurants offer. Portions are fairly generous (not so much with brunch items), and the price fits the quality of ingredients and preparation. The staffing is good, service is timely, and the decor is charming. The craft beers made on site are wonderful. Try a series of 4 ouncers to build your own tasting. The flavor profiles given on the brew menu seem so far to have been accurate.For appetizers, I recommend the shrimp ceviche (technically a "small plate") and the stone oven pretzels (you get two, with cheese and spicy honey mustard dips). I've tried one soup, the corn and chicken chowder, which was very good, nice SW pepper flavor without overwhelming the chicken. We've had sandwiches and entrees, from burgers to steak, and it's all been really delicious. The food is in the American Contemporary Casual style -- better than Houlihan's at the i-Hotel in our opinion.The only bad experience we've had with the food has been the cedar plank brie dessert. It was badly prepared (the brie wasn't even room temperature) and either the recipe was off or the honey-chili sauce was made incorrectly, because it was completely unbalanced and unpalatable. The smoke flavor reacted poorly with what was on the plank, too. We took the brie home (a big piece) and cut off the rind to eat the middle later, but it still tasted of rank sauce and smoke. We did not go back to the restaurant for a couple of months because of just how bad this was. I wrote the general manager and he was good about it, offering to review the recipe and preparation with the lead chef. Since returning to Destihl, we've had good experiences again -- the place is consistent, a fun place to socialize, and a nice addition to CU's restaurant scene.

The broth was good, however. I also had the pepperoni pizza. It was decent. My bf got the cod, it was very tasty. Next time, I will probably try an entree. It was very busy when we went, but we sat in the bar. Service was good.

<Content> I'm a beer nerd, and I'm disappointed by this place so far. I plan to give it more chances, but I've tried the brown ale, Belgian single, a kolsch, and a pale ale, and have been relatively uninspired by nearly all of them.The website lists some hoppier alternatives, but I haven't seen them actually on the menu.

<Content> I have been there twice till now and I am amazed at how classy a brewery's restaurant can be in a college town! They have few of the best appetizers I have had and certainly the best in the urbana-champaign area. They profess their best appetizer are the cheese curds (which are good) but the best of the lot has to be the Potato croquettes. I have had the beer-battered asparagus as well which changed my taste buds liking towards asparagus! I am a vegetarian and its extremely difficult to find a good vegetarian burger, so i was skeptical to order that (most places have burnt, bitter black bean patty!!) but they had one of the biggest veggie burger I have seen. The patty had rice, carrots, ginger and a few other veggies blended with the beans making it really delicious filling. The only vegetarian entree they have is the Stuffed Poblano Peppers, which was excellent. The staff is extremely courteous (sometimes more so than needed) and are very keen to entertain you. A few negatives are, the beer selection is great but is limited. I expect a brewery to have all their beers available (except the seasonal's, obviously) but they seem to rotate their beer. Even though the beer tastes good, I would cut some points for the spread of it. Another thing would be the place is unable to substitute any of the meat based dish with a vegetarian option which is a turn off if you are a vegetarian. P.S. Make a reservation, it is usually crowded!

<Content> I really wanted to like this place. The location is nice and the tables are spacious. It can be both informal or formal and the seating and decor are mellow. The service was very good and our server Aaron was excellent. However....the food is another story.We started with an appetizer that was fine but our meals were terrible. My date ordered the dijon chicken and it was incredibly dry and also came with TWO HAIRS in it! My kobe burger was also very dry and unexciting. The bun was stale and the beef was extremely dry and tasteless. For dessert we ordered a large chocolate cake that was $11. It was okay, but nothing exciting.I'm not a food snob but for the money I would expect a lot more. Sorry to say that this was my first and last experience at Destihl. I hope others have a more favorable experience.

<Content> Having heard and read so many different views on Destihl, I was looking forward to being part of a group dinner tonight. My group of 12 was immediately seated and drink orders were quickly taken. Service was interesting. Although our waiter was excellent, there seemed to be several uncertainties when drinks and food were brought to the table. Things got to where they needed to be, but I was surprised there seemed to be so much trouble just getting the orders to the correct guests.The food was wonderful! We had some excellent shared appetizers -- beer-battered asparagus, stone oven pretzels and beer-battered bacon. I had the Greekish salad and the cedar plank salmon. My wife had bacon & brussels and roasted beet salad. Others had a variety of chicken, seafood and meat entrees. For dessert my wife and I shared the chocolate cake.I tried a few of the four ounce beer samples and had a bloody mary. The beer was very good, the bloody mary excellent in presentation but only average in taste.We were not expecting to spend almost three hours having a leisurely dinner, but the evening was very nice. I was impressed with the general vibe for a Saturday night.All in all, I was impressed with Destihl and will definitely come back to try lunch or perhaps dinner with my wife or a smaller group.

<Content> Our waiter was really nice, but the food was just OK this time. Unfortunately they did not have the Asian chicken wings or Cherry French Toast on the menu that we really enjoyed the last time we ate there. We went there for lunch & I ordered a Thai steak salad. The steak was overcooked in chunks & there were only a few slices of steak. The dressing was sour & just OK. The rest of my family ordered the beer battered bacon app which they loved. My son enjoys the pork sandwich. Their house made chips & chocolate cake are very good.

<Content> Destihl is my go to place for a nice meal in Champaign, The environment is great. this is a must go for couples looking for a nice date. Their draft selection is great (obviously with a huge brewery inside the restaurant) they let you sample a few beers to try out what you like and they have awesome mixed drinks as well. I love their bloody mary (comes with salami, pickles, celery etc) its amazing (I love the spicy-ness of it). Honestly, the food was just okay. I've gotten this asian-ish dish before, a burger (eggs, bacon, wagyu beef) but i would much prefer Farren's, and appetizers. So yeah food is not too special but the drinks are good, waitresses are friendly (Michelle is AMAZING), and dessert is delicious. So honestly, I would come here (sit at the bar) get a few appetizers, drinks, and dessert.

<Content> Beer is seriously bad here, and the food is horrendous. Want beer brats with cabbage? Great, enjoy your greasy, deep fried brats with chopped onions (apparently they ran out of cabbage). Dates with cheese and bacon? Enjoy your dates with no cheese, but covered in chimichurro sauce for some reason. Three dates, which equals two dollars each. Total waste of money. The decor is weirdly airport/hotelesque. Back to the beer. Tried four sampler sizes, two are ok, two taste like ice wine. No fizz, and all sugar.

<Content> Exceptional dining experience.Made a Reservation with the Andrew, the Lead Bartender. I simply mentioned that I wanted a nice dinner because it was a first date, and he made the start of the evening's date very memeorable. When we arrived, Andrew had a reserved table set aside, candles, wine glasses and the first bottle of wine complimentary. Meeting us at the front he personally welcomed us to the restaurant and lead us to our table, and then passed us along to out waiter Vincent. This young man kept a keen eye on our table and made sure our wine glasses were replenished. The food was excellent but an afterthought to the service we received.Thanks Andrew!

There was traditional bar food mixed in with Thai as well as pasta dishes. Just didn't seem coherent to me I guess. Overall, it was a good experience.

<Content> First, reserve a table if you're going at a busy time and want to sit in the dining area.It was my first time at Destihl last night; I will probably go back. Destihl has a great beer selection. I tried about four different beers, all of which were pretty tasty. The appetizers were so-so. We tried potato croquettes and beer battered bacon. The croquettes were run-of-the-mill, but good nonetheless. The bacon was interesting, but certainly not a taste sensation.The main course were pretty variable. My wife ordered the shrimp and grits - which was far too overpriced for such a meager portion. Though, it was fairly tasty. I ordered a Brewmaster's pizza which was very good.The main reason Destihl loses a star is the speed with which we received our drinks order. It must have taken about 15 minutes after ordering for us to receive our drinks. Eventually, we were informed of the backup at the bar. I expect better though.Also, unrelated to my rating, there appeared to be a large number of employees standing around at the greeting station watching other employees working. This could be training, then again, it could be the reason some of the food items are so expensive for the product!

I was seated at a table and waited 14 minutes without seeing a waiter or being offered a drink.  A table directly across from me sat down after me, was given water and drinks.  I asked to see the manager waited another ten minutes so got up and left. Only as I was walking out the door was the manager able to find me.

It was a busy Saturday night and the service was a bit slow but given that we weren't in a rush, that was OK. The food exceeded my expectations. I had the Cuban sandwich and one of the better Cubans I've had in a long time! My wife and friend both had a pasta dish which they enjoyed. The waiter also was very knowledgeable about the menu and large number of beer choices, all of which were excellent too. There are lots of choices in Champaign and I recommend anyone try Distihl!

<Content> My first experience was on a date. I misheard what the waiter said when he was listing the specials. I asked him to repeat after he was done speaking. He sighed and sort of rolled his eyes. I ordered a turkey burger (because I'm epic classy like that). It was cold. It tasted like it would have been delicious had it arrived at my table 10 min sooner.My second time was just last night. I sat at the bar with a friend to have appetizers and a few beers. The lady at the bar was too busy literally dancing with her fellow employee (boyfriend?) and kept kissing and dancing by the kitchen to ever get my second drink.The appetizer I order was incredibly spicy, therefore it had no flavor other than pepper, and was also quite greasy. On top of that the manager saw a buddy of his sitting next to us. They both got into their conversation for a good 10-15min and began talking quite loudly. I could not hear the company next to me telling a story.I may give it another shot, but its pretty unlikely.

<Content> If its TL;DR: Great food, great drinks, great service.I've gone to Desthil a few times, and I'm consistently impressed by their food and attention to detail.Once, I sat at the bar with my dad, just there for drinks; bartender was great, amiable and had suggestions when we knew what we liked and wanted recommendations. Their heffeweissen is really excellent. The apricot brew actually tastes like apricot; I tend to like fruity beers, and this one stood out to me. Their cocktails are also really, really good. I had the sake lemon drop and was not disappointed. Appetizers: Hands down, no contest, their beer-battered asparagus takes the gold. Its a lighter batter, more like a very gentle tempura than a "fried chicken" type fry. The honey-whatever sauce they serve with it is incredible, and they serve a grilled lemon with it that you probably aren't supposed to eat but tastes like candy so do it anyways. The shrimp ceviche is nothing to write home about. The shrimp skewers entree was tasty and well seasoned, but if you came with a big appetite, it might not be the choice for you. Their portions (one of the things I like most about Desthil) are reasonable and not out of this world for most of the main dishes. My boyfriend wasn't totally full when he left, but comfortable. The thai steak salad is incredible! I like a little spice, and this definitely had that! It's not big, but its delicious. Their pizzas are also fabulous, if a little salty. You can't complain that they underseason like some places in downtown Champaign. The seabass dish (I think it was a special) was definitely worth it. They do their cubans right; their mustard is homemade I think and really rounds it out. Overall, loved it. Decently priced for what you get, and you get a great night out!

<Content> My first and hopefully last visit to Destihl was a faculty dinner (Destihl is apparently one of the few places in town large enough to accommodate simultaneous departmental functions, as there were multiple university-based parties that night). But this convenience is off-set by the depressingly overblown chain aesthetic, here manifesting as a too-self-conscious effort to seem "on trend" with both gastro pubs and microbreweries (witness, for instance, the giant prop barrels by the front door) while failing to capture the particular qualities of either. The "artisan food" was as mediocre as expected from this self-described "gastrobrewpub TM." We ordered pizzas as appetizers for the table; "stone oven" seems to be a euphemism for "toaster oven." The crusts were uniformly thin, but creepily so, without bubbling or crispness; the undersides were barely cooked. I suspect pre-formed frozen dough, by the taste and all-too-regular texture. The generous toppings were not supported by the crust, making each slice limp and increasingly wet. We also ordered the deep-fried asparagus, but I refrained -- the asparagus looked both too thick (these stalks were almost hot-dog-sized in circumference!) and too greasy.One of our dinner companions warned us against ordering burgers; on her last visit, her medium rare burger was burned black on one side (and was not at all medium rare). She guessed that the cooks went outside for a smoke and forgot to flip the burgers, but generously wondered if it had just been a long night for them in the kitchen. In an attempt to heed her advice, I tried to order the grilled and stuffed pasta without olives, but the waiter told me that the olives "are already mixed in." I took that to mean that the pasta is made in a giant vat ahead of time (here I imagined a big plastic tub covered in Saran wrap in a walk-in freezer), and grilled to order, which didn't sound all that appetizing. Instead, I ordered the veggie burger (black beans and rice), and my g.f. the Kobe burger, medium rare. Both arrived with one black, charred side; her burger was well-done, ruining the meat. (Why eat Kobe beef if it's just going to be burned to a crisp?) My veggie burger was unremarkable, and my pile of shoestring fries had been overcooked in the fryer, and served to me lukewarm to cold -- totally inedible. I nibbled on two and then had to stop. Cold grease, ugh.I'd much rather order a burger and fries from Steak 'n' Shake, where you know what you're getting for the money. Overall, Destihl was a big "no way." I will strenuously avoid coming here again!

<Content> The positive: The Aztec chocolate martini comes with a brownie garnish. And it's spicy. The waiters and bartenders I've talked to have been incredibly friendly.The food's better than you'd expect, actually. The salad was good, which is maybe not what you'd expect from a place that labels itself a brew pub. The pizza's a little boring, but that's probably just the vegetarian ones I'm limited to. They serve continuously, they have a large cocktail list, they take my American Express... it's everything a burgeoning yuppie alcoholic could want in a brew pub.Except that's not really me so here's what I don't like.The atmosphere. As I read through the descriptions they say "oh the atmosphere is great!" and I say... are you at the same restaurant? It's what a corporate design team thinks of as good atmosphere. Large, airy, and completely devoid of personality. It matches Jim Gould's across the street very well actually.The whole place really just reeks of chain, and I don't think that bothers most people at all but if I want to go in by myself and have a late lunch I feel very awkward. I'm happy to go in with friends and have cocktails and split a pound of cake. (They actually inform me that it is an 11 pound cake split 10 ways, so slightly more than a pound!)Worth checking out, if for no other reason than you too have probably been watching them work on this place for a couple years. You can't NOT go.

Beer battered bacon is good, flatbreads are awesome, and the stout ice cream sandwiches (incredible!) have enough stout that they card people for that dessert! 4oz taster glasses make trying multiple beers fun, and the bartender will even give you a FREE 2 oz taster if you don't know what you want. Will be back over and over again!

<Content> Honestly, I'm a little surprised that Destihl's Yelp rating isn't higher. Two of my friends and I wandered in on a weekday night while looking for a place to eat at in downtown Champaign. The restaurant was relatively full for 7pm on Thursday, so I'd imagine there may be a wait on weekend nights. Beers = good. I think we tried 4? The strawberry blonde ale on tap was a clear favorite for us. Both their beer and dinner menus took awhile for us to look at. I was expecting traditional pub-style food, but their offerings far exceeded that.We started off with the deviled egg appetizer and the beer battered bacon appetizer. Both were very good- the beer battered bacon is a MUST. Jalapeno bacon in a tempura-like beer batter coating topped with a drizzle of maple chipotle glaze?! Yes please! When it came to our table, we slowly stopped talking and watched our plate of bacon descend in front of us. Like it came down straight from heaven. We didn't even realize we stopped talking and didn't remember what we were talking about until the bacon was gone..My friends got the jambalaya and the prosciutto-wrapped meatloaf. I really only tried part of the super tasty andouille sausage corn muffin that came with the jambalaya, as I was working on my full slab of beer-braised ribs (I gave one rib each to my friends to try though). They were perfect. Orders of magnitude better than Black Dog's ribs. I'm not sure whether or not that's a fair comparison since it's different cooking styles, but the texture of Destihl's ribs was absolutely perfect- tender, falling off the bone, but not annoyingly so.. The flavor was great also, as it tasted lovely by itself and did not need to be hidden behind sauce although the chipotle espresso bbq sauce it came with was also very tasty. My friends and I agreed that I "won" dinner since I ordered the best dish. My only qualm was that my shoestring fries were a little soggy and not as crispy as I would have preferred. But that's very minor.We were all pretty full, but could not pass up dessert. Like the rest of their menus, the dessert menu had a lot of tasty-sounding options. After some rock/paper/scissors, we ended up ordering the stout ice cream sandwiches which is more like four round brownie patties a la mode. But by all means, if you really wanted to, I guess you could try to eat it ice cream sandwich style. The alcohol in the chocolate stout ice cream wasn't very strong. Both the ice cream and the brownies were stellar. My friends especially loved the brownies. I was wondering what they did with the remaining brownie part after cutting out the rounds (to, you know, save waste if need be), and our waitress told us that the remainder is used for their chocolate martini? Maybe I'll check that out next time. Oh, and also, our waitress was very nice and friendly too. Overall, good service, clean place, nice decor.. everything was great. After tips, came out to ~$30/person, but actually filling up me + two guys does require a bit of food and drink. I'm already trying to think of when I will return to try the kobe burger..

<Content> Ordered the Steak sandwich...medium. The waitress brought out a big chuck of meat sandwiched between a french roll. When I bit into my sandwich, it was bloody red! Nowhere near medium! On top of that, it was smothered with caramelized onions, which were very strong and took away from the taste of the steak! The service was average. Nothing great. Overall, I would never consider going back. I can find a better steak sandwich for a lot less at a number of different area restaurants. Coincidentally, I spoke to a friend about my experience weeks later when Destihl came up in conversation, only to find out that she had the exact situation happen to her when she visited Destihl. Her steak sandwich was extremely undercooked as well. Must be a common trend with this place. Just another common chain restaurant, as far as I'm concerned!

<Content> This was the fourth time I've been to destihl since it opened in champaign. The first two times were within the first 6 months it opened and I left less than impressed. I finally came back a year or so later and the food has definitely gotten better.This time I went for lunch and had the swordfish tacos with rice and beans on the side.  This was pretty good. Maybe just a bit heavy on the sauce which masked a lot of the fish but the chimichurri sauce itself was good. My wife had the chimichurri shrimp pizza and hers was excellent! I also have to mention the last time I was here I had the beer-brined double bone in pork chop and that was easily the best dish I had here.After a few early lackluster visits this place is slowly becoming one of the better restaurants in the area.

The goat cheese and spinach salad was a little skimpy and I didn't recognize the two little dollops of goat cheese on the salad. The tortilla soup was also nothing to write home about. It is the only place in town with cheese curds! I absolutely love the baked apple dessert! In the evenings, the sun is in just the right place to give a nice shade for the outdoor seating. All in all, I have always enjoyed my visits to Destihl.

<Content> Despite the lack of love for Destihl on Yelp, I have to say: I am besotted.besotted/bistid/ - Adjective: 1. Strongly infatuated: "he became besotted with his best friend's sister".2. Intoxicated; drunk.Now, I am currently the first definition of besotted, with Destihl. I LOVED my visit. I went with Mr. Husband and a Very Close Friend (VCF) before seeing a movie at the Art Theater. Upon leaving, I may have been the second definition of besotted. (Just kidding, I only had one beer. I swear, my Yelp reviews make me sound like an alcoholic sometimes.)We went on a Monday evening around 6. We were seated right away. Mr. Husband and I had never been there, and we were surprised how big the restaurant actually is - it doesn't look that big from the outside. Our waiter came over right away and gave us a nice little menu introduction. I don't know why they've made a restaurant based on the things I personally like, but they did - I wanted EVERYTHING on the menu. Seriously. I haven't had such a hard time deciding on what to order for quite some time. VCF and I decided to split a small plate and an appetizer, so we got the 'House Olives' and the Bacon, Egg & Cheese deviled eggs. For my meal, I got the beer & cheddar soup and the spinach salad. VCF got the bison burger, and Mr. Husband got a special item, a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.Food: Very good, but to be honest, it *could* have been better. If Yelp let me give 4.5 stars, I would've. Everything was solid, but there were a couple things that might just push it over the top. For instance, the house olives small plate? It was agreed that it could be improved by serving the olives pre-chopped, not whole - sort of a mix between an olive salad and a tapenade. The deviled eggs were good, but the yolk was just a bit stiffer than I would've liked. The beer & cheddar soup was yum, but the scallions would have been a little better more finely sliced. The spinach salad was good, but the maple in the maple jalapeno bacon dressing was a little too sweet, and overpowered the other good stuff (grilled portabella mushroom? hell yes.) Another reason I'm torn: I love that they use ingredients from local places when possible, and have put an emphasis on sustainable farming. I'm all for buying locally and supporting small farms and businesses. On the other hand, the way it's flaunted just strikes me as a tad pretentious. Personal bias, but still.Service - Another ALMOST 5 stars. My only issue with our waiter was that he was TOO attentive. Really friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu, gave good recommendations, was able to tell us what HIS favorites are (it drives me crazy when waiters have no idea what's good on the menu.) However, he came by every 5 minutes or so. I always have mixed feelings about that. I like a server who is *there* when I need a water refill or a new fork, etc, but coming by too often just breaks up the conversation. Ambiance - Very cool. Very big-city. I like it. I also like that it's BIG. Ample room between tables. We chose a booth, and it was perfect. The noise level is ideal - quiet enough to talk at a normal level, loud enough that it doesn't feel like everyone in the area can hear what you're saying. Dessert - I can't tell you the last time I ordered dessert after dinner! That NEVER happens! (I actually can tell you, it was at my mom-in-law's birthday dinner in early October.) But VCF knows how to sweet-talk me into sweets (heh), and our waiter was VERY convincing when telling us about the stout ice cream sandwiches, which feature a housemade chocolate ice cream made with their own stout, served on chocolate brownies. Oh. Mah. Gah. SO GOOD. The stout ice cream was phenomenal. The dessert consists of two sandwiches, so you get four brownies and two scoops of ice cream. This would be great to 5 out of 5 stars for the dessert!! Price - Another 5 out of 5 stars. I was expecting that I'd have one entree and a beer. We ended up with a ton of food! For $38.77 before tip (I saved my receipt!), we got: -A soda-A 12 oz. beer - the Malius Apple Blonde Ale - so good!-House Olives app-Spinach salad-Soup-Bacon cheeseburger special-1/2 of the stout ice cream sandwichesSo while I can't yet give Destihl a 'best of the best' rating, I'm definitely a fan, and certainly willing to give it another few tries. I don't want to deter anyone from going here, because my visit was truly enjoyable. I'm already planning to permanently take Jim Gould out of my date-night lineup and replace it with Destihl. I just want to acknowledge that there is some room for improvement. I think with a tiny bit of tweaking, Destihl could easily be one of the top restaurants in C-U.

Taste tests are in order!The food is good, but nothing extraordinary -- on the thai salad, it would've been nice to have more than 4 slivers of steak but it tasted wonderful. The pizzas are also tasty. Clean, inoffensive, and not terribly expensive.

<Content> Went here for dinner with a few colleagues. There was spacious seating, so it was a great place for groups. Had the Dijon chicken with asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes. I was kind of put off by the dark color of the sauce, but the whole entree was pretty good; chicken was flavorful and tender too. For dessert I had the baked apples, which was good but nothing unique. Our waitress was very attentive, but her attentiveness seemed to taper off as the night went on.

<Content> We were here over the weekend and its a really nice spot, we didn't really order food, except for some garlic bread which was cool. We went there for their beer since afterall, they are a brewery. $1.25 for 4oz beers....you can try close to everything they brew and then some. I had 6 and my bf had 5, our bill was just under $20. They had pumpkin ale, hefeweizen, chocolate cherry, coffee beer, IPA's...too many to remember, you'll have to check it out yourself. Can't wait to go back and maybe try some things on their menu. Fun bartender too, ask for Mike!

<Content> Couldn't be better for lunch. Service was on point and friendly (word on the street is they hijacked 80% of Houlihan's staff). Their beers were solid, too. I couldn't get the Yelp App to check me in so I could upload my pic of the tastiest stout I've ever had, so you are just going to have to trust me on its delicousity. I tried a taster (4oz for $1.50) of their berry weiss beer and it was a little too much berry for me, but if you like that kind of thing, you will love Destihl's take on it: the flavors of sweet and tart bounce back and forth dynamically as you sip. A companion loved their IPA, lauding the freshness and the spicyness of the hops.The food is as good as anywhere else downtown. My table ordered the portabello sandwich which was really hearty and came with kettle chips with a touch of seasoning and Destihl's Kobe burger, which is served on a fancy bun I did non recognize and stacked with thick jalepeno bacon, bleu and white chedar cheeses, pickles, and comes with the best steak fries I've ever tasted. That burger is about the same price as Farren's and the verdict was it was just as good, if not better, owing to the extra special toppings. Destihl's fries are thick badasses with the skin on and huge flecks of kosher or sea salt and were both perfectly crispy and cooked the whole way thru. Those are served with their balsamic vinegar (and expresso bean?) barbecue sauce that is unlike any I've ever had. As good as the kettle chips are, I highly recommend you sub in for the steak fries (though I saw some gorgeous piles of sexy shoestring fries served with other dishes, giving me one more reason for a quick return).Another reason for a quick return is the very impressive menu. Vegetarian will have no problem here, nor will the health-concious. They have a wide and deep menu spanning from American classic pub fare to trendy fusion dishes usually found only in more expensive restaurants. Prices were not exceedingly low, however value is good. I did not see their spirits or wine menus, but the lineup behind the bar bodes well for those not in the mood for beer.This place takes the best of Boltini's, Seven Saints, the Pigs, Radio, and Bacaro and serves it up in a killer setting with great modern ambiance. I will never pass up an invite to eat here.

<Content> The waitress and hostess were super friendly. Waitress recommended lots of options (her favorite salad, pizza, app, sandwich, etc) and beers. I went with a strawberry ale, cheese curds and the greekish salad. The beer was excellent - fruity and light! The cheese curds were great but the more you ate, the more blah you felt...share with someone! The greekish salad was weird...it had a red dressing that I didn't like at all. Bill came to $19. A little pricey for lunch but not outrageous.

<Content> I wanted to come back and let ya'll know that Destihl has recently become vegan-friendly! The marinated cucumbers and beer-battered asparagus are both vegan as-is, and Destihl has added an 8 oz veggie burger to their menu that can be made vegan if the mayo's left off. I believe there are a few other items that are vegan (the peanuts and the chips are, sans ranch dip), but I haven't confirmed them with the chef, so I'll leave you to figure that out on your own!

I hadn't read that the fried egg on the BLT was made sunny side up so when I got it I ran everywhere. I don't like sunny side up eggs so they took it back without question and got me a different burger. Which was wonderful! Would have loved to had some dessert but I was too full when I got done.

<Content> Well, I searched the website to see where I wanted to have my birthday dinner with my coworkers. I was seeking out a restaurant that had a little bit of this and a little bit of that so that everyone can find something that they would enjoy eating. Everyone enjoyed their dishes and we kept on watching the staff bring out different dishes as we would comment how yummy it looks.I was torn between two dishes and I asked the staff their recommendation. She did not steer me wrong. It was so tasty that I wanted to eat another entree of it. Every dish they brought to the table look so tempting. Definitely a wide variety and everyone enjoyed a nice beer and atmosphere. Glad we made reservations because the place filled up quick for a Friday night. Service was awesome and I am already missing it. I will definitely be back before I leave town.

The food is quite delicious and very flavorful, however I must say they go overboard with heat at times! (But that us a matter of taste of course !) very clean facilities, comfortable space and very nice selection of beer. I must say that the hard alcohol drinks are not always consistent in flavor or liquid amount.

<Content> My daughter had heard good things about Destihls, so we decided to give it a try. We went on a Saturday night (12/1/12), so the place was pretty busy. Fortunately, I was able to get a reservation through OpenTable via Yelp, so getting in was no problem.When we arrived, we were seated within 30 seconds. I appreciate that efficiency - we also saw several groups that tried the walk-in route - Lesson Learned - use the Yelp reservation system for fast seating!We ordered the home-made chips for an appetizer, and they were great. Very tasty, and a malt vinegar sauce, as well as a spicy sauce.This place makes and serves it's own beer. if you want a Bud Light, you'll have to go elsewhere. If you want to try their beer, the prices are quite honestly, very low for good beer. We tried their 4 ounce beers (I know, so small, but since you're trying a store brew, do I really want 16 ounces I don't like after one sip?) and for $1 and $1.50 (the price range of a 4 ounce beer), we got 2 beers that were very palatable and very good.On to dinner. The menu ranges from sandwiches to steaks to pizza.I ordered the 8 ounce Sirloin, medium rare. The steak was cooked properly, more importantly, it was seasoned properly, and tasted great. It was more tender than some fillets I have had recently. A+!My wife ordered a pork roast dish, that had pork so tender you didn't need a knife. She really liked the dish.My daughter went with the 8 ounce burger, and was very impressed. She ordered it medium rare, and it was cooked to order. She loved it.My son ordered one of the pizzas, and was a little surprised when a large, thin crust pizza arrived (pleasantly surprised - he was expecting a lot less.) The pizza was great.We ordered desert, which included carrot cake (we ordered 1 piece for 2 people, and it was the right choice - very heavy, very good), along with S'mores and a Neopolitan fruit dish, all of which were very good.The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is the noise level - the interior is nicely appointed, and very well done, but the acoustics are not very good. Lots of hard surfaces result in a loud restaurant, where it was hard to hear our server.We'll be back. The entire ticket with tip was less than $110 for four adults.

Everything I've ordered has been great, and the service is spot-on. I've gone with just my husband, larger groups of adults, and have also gone with the kids. It's been smooth sailing no matter the size or composition of the group. Their kids menu is broader than most, which is nice. The regular menu offers unique dishes that have always enjoyed. I would definitely recommend it.

<Content> I've been to Destihl twice now--both times I was pretty disappointed. The first visit we ordered the stone baked pretzels for an appetizer, which was a cool novelty. But for my entree I ordered just a simple bacon cheeseburger (cooked medium), which seems hard to mess up, but it tasted entirely like carbon. The whole outside of the patty seemed to taste of charred chemicals.The second visit was a group outing. I ordered a strawberry goat cheese salad, and it arrived with ONE SLIVER OF A STRAWBERRY on it. It was just greens, a bit of cheese, and one solitary nub of strawberry. Weird.Also the group ordered the pound of chocolate cake, which we were told just came in off the truck, and it was still frozen, so that was a no go. Luckily our nice waitress maybe told the kitchen to take a blow torch to it, because she got it to us before we left.

<Content> We have had Destihl in Bloomington-Normal for some time but I've been looking forward to the addition to the Champaign-Urbana restaurant options for some time. And I'm glad it has arrived!! I found the atmosphere cozier than the B/N Destihl. The service was FAST! My iced tea was never empty (which is impressive because I drink fast and a LOT....which is why I opt for the iced tea and not the beer).The food did not disappoint. I'm a fan of the beer battered asparagus appetizer. And opted for the Brewmaster Pizza on this trip. Everyone in my party of 6 had something different and came away pleased with their meals. I used OpenTable to make a reservation which was quick and convenient. We were in and out in about an hour....much quicker than I expected. In my opinion, a great addition to the Downtown area! Perfect for dinner before hopping over to The Art Theater!  Welcome Destihl!!!

<Content> Visiting friends in Champaign and came here for lunch. Contemporary, open restaurant with a good vibe in downtown Champaign. Our waiter was Trent; very personable, knowledgeable and helpful. There is no set beer flight but you can order 4 oz small glasses if you want to sample. I really enjoyed the Oktoberfest and the Roadblock British Red Ale. We shared the Beer Batter Asparagus for an appetizer and really enjoyed it (Trent encouraged us to squeeze the grilled lemon over the Asparagus and glad that we did). We ordered the Lunch Combos. The soup and sandwiches were top notch.  I know there are a lot of restaurants in the C/U area, but you can't go wrong here. If the rest of the wait staff are as good as Trent, you will be taken care of quite nicely.  Very good beer, very good food in an inviting atmosphere, I definitely recommend Destihl.

<Content> Every time I go to Destihl, I want to love it but I always leave disappointed. The menu is very creative in concept but the execution is always sub par. I've tried the seared scallops over curried mashed potatoes and the thai half chicken. The scallops were hardly seared and the potatoes were waaaaay over salted. The chicken on the other hand was far under spiced and seasoned. I will say their beer battered jalepeno bacon is delicious but deep fried food is pretty hard to screw up. Overall the prospect of having a modern american restaurant with an eclectic menu in the CU area is a great one, but a bit more attention to detail would greatly help Destihl.

<Content> Tried this place around 5:30 on a weeknight and it was not at all busy. It did start getting busier towards the end of the meal, but our service was good. Luckily for me I had not been highly anticipating the opening of Destihl. The beers were good enough. There were about a dozen to choose from so if you drink beer at all, you should be able to find one you like. The night we went in we were given free 2oz samples of as many of the beers as we wanted to try. I tried the Belgian, Strawberry Blonde and Raspberry Wheat, Champaign Blond and Frankengluten - good flavors, but none will be appearing on my all-time favorites list. The Frankengluten was interesting and worth a try if you are adventurous. Our waiter was nice and attentive enough but could not properly give drink recommendations since he was not old enough to drink. I thought this strange since, clearly, patrons are going to want to know about the beer. The food... I had the brie and portabello sandwich with chips. The chips were average and the sandwich was bland. That's honestly about the best I can say. My dinner partner said his steak salad was excellent and it looked fresh and crisp, but I can't vouch for the taste. We split the beer battered asparagus and that was by far my favorite item. I will probably go back at some point for another try. The pizza and a desserts sounded like they may have potential.Second visit 8/27/11: Finally tried the pizza (pesto and goat cheese) and still really no change in my review. Nice wait staff but the food does not overly impress. You do receive a large quantity of food for the price. Although, for me, quantity does not trump quality.

<Content> If there were an option for negative stars, DESTIHL Champaign would have a rating of -5 stars. What a complete failure this restaurant is. This place reminds me too much of the Jim Gould success failure story. It's a tale of how a restaurant owner and chef become to sure of themselves and stop trying only to discover complete failure. I pride myself in knowing good food and good restaurants. I have studied cullinary technique and have a passion for fresh, quality ingredients that produces a meal that leaves you longing for more. I write this review, having visited DESTIHL three times spread out over the course of a year. I sent my food back two out of the three times. The second time, I ordered the veggie burger which was hands down the WORST veggie burger I've ever sampled. I did not send this back because it was not the way the burger was cooked, it was a pure and simple failure on the design. My first experience I ordered swordfish. It was overcooked, returned and cooked perfectly. My husband ordered the Bison burger, medium rare and it came out well done. While waiting for the food to return, the manager apologized and brought us free appetizers. The meal ticket was reduced due to the error in the kitchen. I was optimistic about this restaurant and the situation was handled perfectly.Last night, I returned for what I was hoping to be a perfect swordfish. My husband's and I's order was the same. Bison burger and swordfish. First try at our order lended the same results. Both dishes overcooked and returned. Second try at our order, my husbands burger was cooked perfectly, my swordfish was raw. Third try at the swordfish, still raw! I changed my order to salmon at the waiter's recommendation. Finally a manager appears and delivers the Salmon stating "this is cooked to the chef's perfection." The manager slither's off like a snake before I even touch the salmon. Without cutting into the salmon, It was obvious that this fish was too raw. My family had finished eating and after an hour and a half wait with no food, no appetizers, and a chef that I was now convinced can not cook at all, I ordered a Greek Salad. This salad looked like someone threw the ingredients on my plate. No order, presentation was horrible. The dressing was red oil. This dressing did not taste like greek dressing at all. I ate the salad in disbelief that this place can not even prepare a good salad. Our ticket was once again adjusted but this experience left a sour taste in my mouth. I e-mailed the general manager and COO for the company and am awaiting a reply. I would recommend no one go to this restaurant. Seated across the street is Ko Fusion, an amazing restaurant. This restaurant is too close for comfort for DESTIHL as this is where I will be seated watching DESTIHL's doors close for good if they do not find a chef that can cook the menu that was created.EDIT: Less than 12 hours after my e-mail, I received a phone call from the general manager. He was very kind and appologized. More than this he listened. He was kind and acknowledged that my concerns were valid. He stated over and over again that there are no good excuses. Humiliy allows for growth and I hope that this general managers humility induces change that produces solid growth.In March 2013, My husband and I used compensation cards to return. The following is my email to the manager of destihl.I e-mailed back in October regarding a disappointing dinner and service that my family I experienced at Destihl Champaign. We received compensation cards and returned tonight in order to assess if the service and food improved. Our server was once again phenomenal, but the food was less than stellar. My husband and I both ordered the swordfish, which were once again not cooked properly. The swordfish were dry and over cooked, even upon reorder. I guessed by the drying of the fish that a meat thermometer was used to assess if they were cooked properly, which in my opinion is an amateur error. I then ordered a small portion Greek salad due to my hunger, my husband did not order one and we were charged for both. I then ordered a gluten free Mediterranean pizza and my husband, a bone in ribeye. My pizza could not possibly have been gluten free because within seconds, I felt sick and bloated and my husband's ribeye was cooked unevenly and dried out! Most likely another piece of meat fallen victim to the meat thermometer. With a history in restaurant service and cooking, I was appalled that we were charged for the salads and the pizza and were virtually comped nothing for the less than stellar food that we received. Please do not send us any more compensation cards as we will not be returning, but I wanted to let you know that we are completely dissatisfied with ALL of our experiences at Destihl Champaign.

<Content> We were greeted and seated near our reservation time even though the restaurant was very busy. Our server was quickly at our table and very attentive at first. We ordered our drinks and food and all was well. However, an hour later our server explained that there were a number of large parties who were getting their food before us so it was taking this long. He delivered our food and never came back to the table. My order was correct and fairly tasty but my wife's order was wrong and there was never anyone to ask about correcting it. Very long wait for the wrong food and very disappointed in our experience. There are quite a few restaurants downtown, this will not be on our short list for another visit.

<Content> The bacon is great and the asparagus is amazing. This is all I can say good for this place. The wait staff always seems very busy standing in the corner chatting instead of checking on patrons. I've given this place too many chances to be disappointed every time. I even wrote a letter to the manager once to get an insencere apology. Clearly nothing has changed as I am writing this sitting at the bar after being ignored for 20 minutes and counting with an empty glass on a very slow Monday night.

<Content> I have been here 3 times for dinner and both times I enjoyed the food. It's also a very good place to bring children, and they have healthier children's meals with pb & j and fruit, unlike many other places that just add junk into children's meals. Each time I've been here, I've had a generally positive experience. The wait staff are very friendly and helpful. I would definitely continue to go here.

<Content> Foodie euphoria. You can presume the food is going to be incredible when they offer a sous-vide entree on the menu. I actually altered my business travel plans to come to Destihl based on Yelp reviews, and am super glad I did. I drove through Illinois on a day trip and passed the Destihl sister location in Normal early in the morning before they had opened, so I decided to stay overnight in Champaign to visit the other Destihl location. I ordered the Red Chili Pork entree and it was, quite simply, remarkable. [note: I posted a tryptich Instagram photo of my dining experience here on Yelp] I also sampled several of their beer offerings, conveniently (and affordably) sold in 4 oz. taster glasses. All were more than satisfactory as compared to other microbreweries, of which I have been to many. The interior is also pleasant, being situated in a newly constructed building. There is outdoor seating, which was in high demand on the warm early evening I was here in late June. As one who travels a lot for work, I can strongly recommend this restaurant.

<Content> Went for dinner and sat on the patio which was wonderful because there was a band playing on the corner. Our food was very good, but the best part was the coffee and dessert! Our waiter recommended the sour cherry bread pudding and it was awesome. Our waiter was great too. Despite them being extremely busy, he was very attentive and very helpful!

<Content> This place is pretty bad. The decor looks like the contractor went to Lowe's or Home Depot and bought all the "fancy" materials from the discontinued materials section (and just a note here to the management: really? bathroom stall doors that go all the way to the floor? Western civilization pivots on the ability to look down and see if there are feet under the door and thus realize that you have to wait a minute instead of jiggling the door handle like some pee-filled serial killer). The service was equally uninspired -- my least favorite combination of ingratiatingly peppy and incompetent, and the food was mediocre when it got there. It took so long to appear at the table that I was sort of hoping that the cook had sent out for it from another restaurant, but no such luck. And I only thought this might be the case because the menu says that the kitchen likes to get food from local sources. This might be technically true -- they might like it -- but there's not much evidence that they actually do it. I think I can honestly say that the last time I experienced this kind of ambience I was in an airport restaurant.

<Content> Update: I had eaten at Destihl a couple months ago, and the best word for my dining experience at that point would be "inconsistent." Last night I returned to Destihl so that I could form a more definite opinion. For my main course, I ordered the Brewmaster's Pizza, which was served with chicken, andouille sausage, ale onions, and an espresso-chipotle barbecue sauce. The pizza was nothing to rave about, but it probably would have been quite a bit better if a) the pizza had been served hot instead of lukewarm and rapidly cooling, and b) the crust had been cooked all the way through. My brother's pizza was also apparently cold and undercooked, and reading through the other reviews, this seems to be common for diners at Destihl who order pizza. I think I've probably accumulated enough evidence at this point--Destihl is not worth the high prices. There are so many better restaurants in Champaign.

<Content> We've eastern here before but was less satisfied this time.  Waited an hour for a table which was a function of the table simply not turning over which was probably a function of a slow kitchen based on our experience.  The food was medium this time.  My wife had the trout which was really too spicy and overwhelmed the trout taste. My shrimp kabobs seemed like they were cooked earlier in the day and then reheated.  They looked like they were cooked to death but they were mildly warm -- not hot.  The custom brew was mixed -- some acceptable and some bad (their pale ale). The kids were OK with their meals.  The deserts are decadent but can be expensive.  $10 for a slice of chocolate cake at this place in middle of Illinois?  Kind of expensive. Why not cut it in half and charge $5.50?  Anyway, we we divided between 2 and 3 stars although we have had higher rated meals here in past years.

<Content> I went for lunch with high expectations, and was bitterly disappointed.  I ordered the "choose two," including the pastrami reuben sandwich and the beer cheese soup.  A brew-pub has to have great beer-cheese soup, right? WRONG!!!! The soup was like a creamy caraway broth with some green onion garnish. No taste of cheese or beer, just gross. The Pastrami Reuben, described as served on Cranberry Nut bread, looked interesting on the menu. However, what I received was essentially a large cranberry nut scone (about 4" tall) sliced in half with three small pieces of pastrami, a few shreds of sauerkraut, and invisible swiss cheese. I normally do not send things back in a restaurant, but this showing was so horrible, I sent it back. I tried the $13 American Kobe burger instead. Eh. It was an average - but by no means worth $13 - burger (think akin to the pre-made patties you find at Sam's Club) and, once again, the bread-to-meat ratio was WAY off.  Anyway, $40 later, we walked out very disappointed. I can think of several places in town I could go and spend much less for a much higher quality experience.

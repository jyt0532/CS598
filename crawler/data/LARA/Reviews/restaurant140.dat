<Content> Came by for a solo dinner here, and loved every minute of it. What I thought was going to be a simple dinner turned out to be a spontaneous treat for myself. Nick took really good care of me even while he was busy running around helping other tables. He recommended a Spanish Blanc to start off the meal. Light, dry, well-balanced with plenty of depth.I had the Soy Cream Louisiana Chicken Pasta paired with a Riesling (can't remember the name). The dish was all-around fantastic. The sauce was moderately thick with plenty of heat, bow-tie pasta was cooked to perfection, and the chicken was so crispy on the outside, I almost enjoyed slicing into the meat as much as I enjoyed the meal itself, ha. The Riesling was mildly sweet enough to match the heat from the pasta. Simple and spectacular. I loved it.Overall, I felt like I got what I paid for, and then some. I'd love to come back for a full coursed dinner (eyes on that garden steak). Well done, Miga!

<Content> Came here for dinner a few days after my first visit.The nice looks of the place started to feel misleading pretty quickly.The booze pours are super stingy. Both the beer and the wine glassware was modern and nice to look at, but the volume of liquid they were filled with made me feel like I was getting shafted by the bar tender.To eat, we got the Louisiana Chicken pasta dish and the Bibimbap.The Louisiana Chicken pasta tasted great and, in all seriousness, probably checked in at 2,000-3,000 calories. A significantly heavier meal than a double cheeseburger and fries at Five Guys. It was a huge bowl of heavy whipping cream and melted cheese, with some pasta for texture. The whole time I was eating it, I felt like the waitress should have been wearing a vest with flair pins and saying "Welcome to Applebees!" Totally not what I expected to be served in a restaurant like Miga.The Bibimbap was super sexy looking, but left everything to be desired on the eating side of things. It was missing the most important component of that famous dish - the dolsot, or hot stone bowl. It tasted only okay. Bottom line is that it was closer to a cold salad than any Bibimbap I've ever had.I'm sure I'll come here again, but I'll give the menu some time to work itself out.

<Content> I would have given it 5 stars but i gave it 4 because the mochi ice cream was literally a single mochi piece. And it was pretty expensive for that single mochi piece. No, Miga. Just no. MORE MOCHI.Otherwise I REALLY liked this place. Definitely trying to be a trendy place. Definitely trying hard to look like it belongs in Chicago, but so what?! It's pretty good. The decor is great and the drinks are 1) really good and 2) really strong and 3) reasonably priced. So super A plus for that. It is really similar to a different place called Sakanaya on the U of I campus (Green St.) but...assuming you aren't in the mood for sushi...Miga's food is better.In terms of food, when I went I had some sort of soy pasta type of thing. For meat eaters like myself, I tend to stay away from anything soy, tofu-y or that is attempting to replace my lovely meat. This thing was awesome though and didn't taste all weird and vegan-y. My friend had the galbi steak which was EQUALLY as delicious.Bathrooms were clean. Restaurant was clean. The service was kind of working out the kinks (we went on a soft opening night) but everyone was super friendly and really nice. I enjoyed myself.Fix your dessert game and I'll up it to five stars.

<Content> We decided to try this place after watching a great film at the art theater. We arrived around 9pm on a Saturday and there were plenty of diners and the atmosphere was nice. We decided to sit at the bar since we were only going to have some light food and a drink. We sat and sat and sat for about 15 minutes at the bar where staff was coming and going constantly before anyone said anything to us. After we were finally acknowledged the staff person was nice and gave us menus. Then our actual waitress came to take our orders and give recommendations. I had a cocktail called It's Seoul Good. The cocktail was tasty similar to a cosmo with soju. We decided to share the Migu noodles which was very pretty and flavorful but VERY spicy. Even my boyfriend who loves spicy food thought this was a bit over the top. Admittedly they mentioned it was spicy but this still seemed a bit on the extreme side and I'm no wimp. We finished our meal and as we finished our drinks I pulled out a credit card to pay and then the waiting began again. Another 15 minutes before anyone said anything or came to give us the check while the waitress stood less than 5 feet away chatting up someone the entire time. It's one thing to be super busy and the service be slow but there was plenty of staff that just were totally ignoring us or so busy chatting up one customer they couldn't be bothered to check if we needed anything. A quick bite that should have taken at most 45 minutes took closer to an hour and a half. The food and drink were ok but still fairly pedestrian. I may give this place one more try but I'm not itching to get back for anything we experienced.

<Content> 4 stars to the atmosphere and our cute waitress Rose. 3 star to the food. 2 to the cocktail Miga75.We had the Golbi Rib-eye, nice flavor and texture and large portion. But no surprise there. The Buddism Bibimbap was just mediocre. The Miga75 was a plain mix of Gin, Soju and lemonade (with pulp). And one big plus is the serving team was really on it, nice, pleasant and helpful. Good place for a date night.

<Content> Started with the sashimi garden salad and scallop. We both decided on steak and I got the garden fillet and the wife got the ribeye. Both were superb but the ribeye was definitely the favorite. Finished with the red bean Moche ice cream. Service was excellent, I can't find anything to criticize so definitely 5 star.

<Content> I love Miga! I have never written a review before, but I felt the need to do so for this place! I live in Chicago but grew up in Urbana and everytime I've come to visit, I make sure to go to Miga. Since it's been opened I've gone 3 times.The food has been perfectly prepared all three times. I got the salmon, filet and spicy noodles as my main dishes and the wasabi Caesar salad all three times to start. The salmon was very moist and prepared to medium rare (the way it's meant to be). The filet was tender enough to cut with my butter knife and prepared medium rare (the way it's supposed to be) with tons of flavor! And the noodles were super spicy and had a ton of fresh veggies (only get if you truly like spicy food).Service has been great every time. My server all three times has been Morgan and she's attentive and professional, as well as extremely sweet. Nick is also amazing! He has helped us choose from their amazing wine list each time. Ask for him if you need help deciding, it's definitely worth it just to talk to him wine in general!This is a great fine dining, young, interesting, and fresh restaurant that Downtown champaign needs!

<Content> Food is OK. Environment is awesome. Service is off. As previous review mentioned, chashu bun is a must try. Fried apply pie is special. However, the waitress is not prompt, who won't come to check if water is needed for the entire dinner.

<Content> We visited MIGA at 7 PM on a Friday evening. We found a seat immediately... very lucky for us (it is still a hidden gem and not many people are aware yet). The interior had clean lines, an industrial element, and modern. The staff was attentive and pleasant. The bar manager Nick visited every table and chatted with diners. he was very cordial. Our waitress Morgan was helpful.For appetizer, we shared the Wasabi Caesar Salad $9. It was likely the best Caesar salad I've ever had...crisp and fresh with excellent taste (a bit spicy but very yummy). For the entree, I had the Chef's Garden Steak $38, an extremely tender tenderloin with potato puree, caper salsa, garlic chip, and caper cream. My wife's entree was the Soy Cream Louisiana Chicken Pasta $15: rich and spicy. Topping it off with Fried Apple Pie for dessert $6, which was fried apple pie with sour cream ice cream and miso butterscotch. My suggestion is to ask for your miso butterscotch on the side (most would not think it is a dessert sauce).Note that the owners also own the Sakanaya Restaurant on Green Street in Campustown, a highly-rated spot.Excellent meal, high quality, pleasant service. Really enjoyable.

<Content> 4 stars for environment, 3 stars for food (I would say no surprise), 3 stars for cocktail.Environment is definitely great in Cham-bana area. However, the food taste more like average. Still, Chashu Bun is a great starter!

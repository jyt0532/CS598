<Content> Don't understand the many negative reviews. DP Dough is fantastic and one of the only places in the area to get a good calzone. They frequently run deals ($5.50 calzones) through online ordering and you get A LOT of food. The calzones are incredibly fresh and filling. It has that "drunk food" reputation, and don't get me wrong it fits that bill as well, but it's fantastic in any state. Don't plan on dining in, however. They have a tiny awkward little counter that you hypothetically could eat at, but you'd be the first person I've seen doing it.

<Content> I ordered the Hot Box Special, with a Spinner 'Zone (spinach calzone), fries, and a can of Cherry Coke. The total came to $9 with tax.I got a lot more food than I expected, but with less flavor than I would have liked. I was stuffed after eating 2/3 of the calzone, half of the fries, and all of the sauce. There was only a smidgen of spinach (mostly cheese and dough), and since I like tomato sauce, not enough of it. The soda was a splurge since I don't drink it often, but it's really not necessary.I would recommend saving a few dollars by not getting the combo, and instead getting just a calzone and an extra container of sauce for $0.60. That would put it on par with about 3 slices of decent pan style cheese pizza folded up. Think twice about paying more for toppings, because they were inconsequential in my order.Bottom line: I'm not planning on ever going back, but I don't feel sick or cheated, either.

<Content> Being from Champaign, It's clear that restaurants on campus thrive off of the thousands of students that suddenly appear near September and leave in May. However, some of the restaurants that have established themselves on campus have forgotten the basics of running a business, and the only reason why they're still open Is because of the franchise name. To who ever owns and operates DPD on campus; if it wasn't for your Party Zone with hot sauce instead of marinara, given the excess time it takes for your employees to make it and how much they clearly don't give a fuck, I would tell you to lock the doors and call it. If you had a clear business strategy with a strong positive customer base, I wouldn't be telling you this nor would you be only located in a little Shit ran strip mall on the west side of Green st. Step your Shit up.

<Content> They falsely advertized a $1.99 Zone calzone deal through EatStreet.com on the U of I campus. They posted flyers saying you need to order through the EatStreet site, but then bait-and-switch you with a price that's 50% higher on the website. Skeezy time-wasting business-practices deserve one star and no patronage.

<Content> Ben Wyatt would not approve. I ordered a firecracker calzone for delivery, paid 15% tip and my total was $10.92. It was just barely warm when I received it and the box was all soggy from the condensation. I had maybe 5 jalapenos in the whole 'zone. The sausage is super weird and leaves a terrible aftertaste. I think I've developed TMJ from the amount of effort I had to put into chewing the crust. This was my first and only time trying DP Dough. My mouth now tastes like a spicy armpit and I am not impressed.

<Content> I can see this place being one of those "I'M DRUNK, GIMME SOME FOOD" staples for UIUC students and visitors alike. Had I been drunk when I tried it, this might have been a 5-star review. But here's the lowdown from a sober perspective.Sis & I ordered online, (there were all sorts of deals through the website and through a 3rd party... it was all a little confusing, but the 3rd party actually ended up giving us the better deal) one Safety Zone and one Spin Zone. Delivery time was right on track with what they told us (about 45 minutes). The calzones were in their own labeled boxes, and sis handed me mine (Spin). I opened the box, and then opened the calzone (which was already split in half), and yelled out in horror, "OH DEAR GOD ITS FULL OF MUSHROOMS." You see, I hate mushrooms. I thought I was going to have to make an angry phone call, but it turns out they had put my calzone in the box labeled Safety, and my sister's calzone in the box labeled Spin. An easy mistake, but they really should be more careful about these kinds of things.The food was alright. The crust was a little soggy, and I could have crisped it up in the oven, but I was just so hungry. There could have been more ricotta, but thats my personal preference. 3 stars about sums it up.

<Content> I have probably been to DP Dough more than any other eating establishment in my life. This was mainly due to the fact that it was pretty cheap, close to my apartment, and satisfied every drunken desire that I had. Because I went there so often, I knew what worked for me and what did not work for me. I was a big fan of the Black & Blue (tastes like a burger with blue cheese), the mangus (pesto and pepperoni), the titan (pesto and pineapple), and the buffer zone (blue cheese, hot sauce, etc). There was only one or two times where I was not completely satisfied with any of these. My friends were all big fans of the Barbecue Chicken zone. I have eaten it twice. The first time I was less than satisfied because of all the hype, but the second time I was happy with my decision. For the most part, the calzones were delicious. There were a couple times where they may have been a little undercooked, but I preferred that over being burned to a crisp.As for cons, there are times where the service is very slow. This is mainly because as a "drunk food" establishment, people normally order between the hours of 1-3 AM, when this place is bumpin'. It will generally take 30-45 minutes when you order at this time to get your food so plan accordingly otherwise you will be forced to observe the happenings at Green Street Cafe. Other issues people may have with the staff. I would not say that any interaction I have had has been particularly friendly, but I always just took that as how the environment there was.DP Dough was a large part of my collegiate experience and I have no regrets about all the money that I spent there.

<Content> The zones' are definitely worth the price. A calzone and a soda special during lunch for $6.50. And it actually tastes pretty good. But I will never dine in again because of the cackling hyena that works behind the counter. The entire time she was laughing and talking about her life with more cackling. I even looked around a few times to make sure I wasn't in a scene from the lion king.

<Content> To the Knife-and-Fork person ("P.S. According to my friends, the "DP" stands for double penetration... and that will likely be your experience with this place."): So you're saying any experience with this place will be a gang bang? Nice try, but A) that doesn't even make sense, and B) NO pizza, calzone or wing place in a college town supplies forks and knives -- why would they? Would you eat a sandwich with a knife and fork? Because that is exactly how you hold/eat a calzone. What a petty thing to be critical of...Anyhow, I LOVE D.P. Dough. Their calzones are incredibly fresh, and there's a TON of variety. If you should decide to build your own, there are at least 25 different ingredients to choose from, as well as different crusts and dips. I've ordered delivery (to downtown Urbana, which is a far cry from their brick-and-mortar facility) from them several times now, and it's never taken more than 45 mins. The delivery people have always been super friendly, too.D.P. Dough has definitely been one of the better dining experiences I've had in the area -- certainly the best delivery experience.

<Content> I never had a calzone before so I was actually a bit nervous on what to expect. After biting into a hot D.P Dough Calzone, I was hooked. The calzones are great, and the dipping sauces are even better. It's not too expensive, costing around $6-7 for a HUGE calzone that can easily be split up into two meals. The calzones are packed with fresh ingredients, and you can even make your own calzone including up to 5 ingredients of your choice (more at an extra cost). Most people pass over it too, and while it doesn't look impressive, I definitely recommend paying the extra 60 cents for the garlic parmesean dough. It adds a ton of flavor. Much better than the original dough used for the calzones.  Even more surprising, the cookies are absolutely amazing, and HUGE. I would prefer these over the renowned Insomniac Cookies anyday. They only cost about $1.50 each, but seriously, the cookie is huge. Something like a 6-7 inch cookie. Some days even bigger. For only a $1.50, it's like 3 to 4 times the size of an insomniac cookie and tastes just as good in my opinion. They even have a special where you can get two free cookies with two calzones. Don't skip on the cookies!My only complaint is that one of the workers (who seems to be there all the time) is just always disgruntled and has been rude to customers. Cheer him up, and there's really nothing to complain about.

<Content> *Sigh*I placed an order with DP dough, and they forgot to include a knife and fork both times.I think at the basic level, ordering an empanada (like a Pizza Hut P-zone) requires a fork and knife. Now when I've also ordered a side salad, doesn't it REALLY make sense to include a fork at the least?At the suggestion of a co-worker, I called the store to let them know. The guy working at the time claimed that my two-for-two experiences with no fork/knife were "the only two times he's ever heard of a customer not getting them". Yea right.Goodbye DP Dough. You may dump loads of money into lame T.V. commercials, but your just-plain-OK food coupled with horrible logic and an apparent deficit of plastic forks and knives is unacceptable.P.S. According to my friends, the "DP" stands for double penetration... and that will likely be your experience with this place.

<Content> I am crazy for a good calzone.These aren't anything to get worked up about.The fillings are fair (though I'd love to see green olives on the menu). The crust was very dense--too dense. Maybe not cooked well enough. All the other calzones I've ever had had a nicely browned, semi-crispy top. This one was almost the consistency of Wonder Bread. Top this with a super bland marinara sauce, and you've got a mouth full of disappointment. The cheese sticks were pretty tasty. If anything else about our order had been up to snuff, we would have thought of ordering these again.The apple pie sticks are a waste of your life. Just burn some cheap, whole-wheat toast and pour some canned apple pie filling on it.

<Content> Today our order took an hour and a half to get here, and once it got here the chicken wings were soggy and cold. The calzones were undercooked. And on top of it all one calzone was missing, and we were offered only a refund or a calzone (2 hours after our order was placed).

<Content> DP Dough is a lifesaver. They have a big selection of calzones, and on the off chance you don't see one you like, you can also custom design one (known as "Construction Zone" where you can have up to 4 ingredients). Personally, my mouth just waters whenever I look over the menu and have to remember that these things are very filling so I can't order the 5 different calzones I'd like to try. I'm trying to work my way through the list, but so far my favorites include the Testing Zone (breaded chicken, pesto, mozzarella) and a combination of the Veggie Zone and Parking Zone (broccoli, breaded chicken, mushrooms, mozzarella).All the calzones are made fresh the moment you order them, are absolutely delicious, and only cost $6. They're definitely perfect for when you need got the munchies, are studying late at night, or when you discover you're actually really hungry after a night out at the bars, and even better? They deliver late!!!Monday - Wednesday until 2amThursday - Saturday until 3amSunday until 1amThey do lose some points for their turnover time though. It takes them upwards of an hour to get the food delivered to you - the reason for which is because they need to make and bake your order first before they can get it out to you. The plus side to this though, is that your calzone arrives fresh and piping hot with the cheese in the middle still oozing out when you take a bite.

<Content> My boyfriend, in his haze of sickness, committed to bed rest on a limited diet, suddenly sat up and said, "Have you had DP Dough?" I had no idea what he was talking about.Apparently calzones are the cure for all ills because he got up and told me to look up the menu and that we had to go - and he was right. Oh my gosh, DP Dough's calzones are good! Namely because I haven't had many opportunities to try calzones!We ordered three calzones that lasted for two days:Combat 'Zone (pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, mushroom & mozzarella) which was a solid calzone but not my favorite.End 'Zone (steak, onion, green pepper and mozzarella) that I wanted to steal from my boyfriend because it was technically his.Maui Wow (ham, pineapple & mozzarella) my favorite! You must get this!Each calzone was made with white flour, and came with a nice cup of tomato sauce that I wished was twice as big.The menu is huge so I plan to go back for more 'zones, and to try them made with the garlic crust.

<Content> As study-binge food goes, DP Dough is a good choice. No pizza, but their calzones are just as good and they have a huge variety of options. Their wings are baked instead of fried, which means its a slightly less guilty treat and they are actually quite delicious. The surprise here? Their fresh-baked cookies are actually better than the better-known Insomnia Cookies. Big and chewy, they make a great dessert after you binge on wings and calzones.

<Content> DP Dough... My first impression of this place was not so nice. Fist time I had their calzone, I went to their place to pick it up. The place looked bit unsanitary and I noticed that not everybody was wearing gloves or had aprons.However, the second time a had DP Dough calzone, I ordered one. And yes, they do deliver to far destinations and work 24/7. So when you're hungry at 3am in the morning, DP Dough is what you should go for. I know that they have wide selection of calzones. However, I have tried only one kind, the "Ranch Buffer" couple of times. I remember it was pretty good (especially after several beers). I highly recommend trying it.

<Content> Previously this would have been a 4-5 star review but the last two times that I have ordered during the lunch hour my calzones have been burnt and the fries have been over done (nice word for burnt). I used to love ordering from DP Dough because the food was awesome. Once they get a new cook then I may re-evaluate their resturant but unfortunately right now they are no longer one of my favorite resturants.

<Content> Perhaps some day, I'm going to bring my children to my alma mater, the U of I. I'm going to show them the buildings and where I lived and all the things that I experienced as an undergraduate here. And when my tour winds to a close, I will take them to the place that supplied me with countless nights of late night munchies. The place that gave me something delicious to believe in, a place that never disappointed me when I opened the box. Some day, I'm going to take my kids to DP Dough.DP Dough itself is not really a restaurant - it is primarily for us cyber monkeys who do everything through the Internet, especially in ordering food. The restaurant itself has a small seating area that is almost always empty, and has exactly four seats.Now to the important part - the food. Every calzone that comes out of this place is first placed at the altar of the calzone gods and given a proper blessing. Only then does it become fit for human consumption, at which point it has spontaneously morphed from an ordinary calzone into a holy image of the calzone gods themselves. The dough is baked to a perfect crisp, and all that is contained within the dough is molded from the sinews of something superhuman. These calzones have never disappointed me, and it makes me happy to know that they never will. And unless they take down their altar to the calzone gods, my children will not be disappointed either.

<Content> I get off work late and by the time I can find a point to look for something to eat, my choices are somewhat limited up north. So on my way home from work, I remembered a place my wife and I looked up on-line some time ago. There was no way they'd deliver to our area so I decided to drop by the D.P. Dough store. The reviews online have been, for the most part, positive. The menu from their website looked promising.I stopped by and ordered a couple of cal-zones and a cookie. I didn't know what to expect. There were a couple people ahead of me and I placed my order and waited a reasonable amount of time for my food. The price was decent, but I didn't spot the specials until after I ordered (so I missed out on a second cookie).Once home with my wife, we opened the boxes and dived into the cal-zones. From the very first bite, I definitely became a fan. I finished one half then picked up the cookie. It was still warm, still gooey and simply awesome. It was actually a pretty good sized cookie, enough to split between the two of us.Needless to say, I will be trying this place again for its other selections and making sure I get the special.

<Content> I used to order from here about once a week. One day they told me they don't deliver where I live, and were really busy and didn't know what to tell me. I didn't plan on calling back until they put coupons on my door advertising delivering there. When I called and ordered they told me it would take longer to deliver since I wasn't in their delivery area. How does that make sense? It is good, just hope you are in the delivery area, or its a good time for them to bring you what you order. Heaven forbid a delivery place delivers when they are busy.

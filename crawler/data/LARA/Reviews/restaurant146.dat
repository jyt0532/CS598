<Content> not expecting "authentic" chinese food or anything from a place called "6 Minute Chinese"; just the basic chinese junk food. food was not awful, but their service is horrible.1) ordered at 11:30 for delivery at 12:30. got there at 1pm, and i still had to go meet the driver to get my food. 6 minute chinese? nope.2) got soup with my order, but no spoon.3) got pot-stickers, and they left off the sauce. when i called them about it, the guy said they were out. 4) not much meat in my kung pao chicken, mostly white onion.5) was given a spring roll instead of a pork egg roll.there is nothing "express" or "6 minute" about this joint. they simply do not care about service. i will never order from this place again.

<Content> Some of the worst Chinese food that I have had in a long time. My wife and I ordered delivery. She got Szechaun vegetables and I get sesame chicken. Two pretty typical Americanized Chinese meals. The vegetables were way overcooked and who knows what the chicken was. The pieces were so tiny and they were really leathery and chewy. I don't recommend this place.

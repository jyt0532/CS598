<Content> We tried this place because their order minimum was $10 (not $20) and they had very reasonable prices.The steamed pot stickers are fantastic. They aren't too big or too small and they're actually steamed and flavorful. The dipping sauce is great. The crab Rangoon was also very good, even if they seemed a bit overdone. The filling was very tasty.Edited as of November 2011:Tried this place again and went to go pick up the order. The guy behind the counter didn't even start making the meal until we showed up to pick up the meal, despite the fact that it was pre-paid online. The restaurant was unclean and the food was just okay. Wanted to like it more but we won't be going back, despite the tasty pot stickers and crab rangoon.

<Content> short on time + not wanting to make dinner + convenience of online order/delivery = 6 minute chinese tonight for dinner. it was not good. not even okay. it was really kind of gross. i ordered kung pao bean curd.... and literally... it was just bean curd and sauce. no peanuts. no water chesnuts. no veggies. nothing. just bean curd..... oh, and sauce. that tastes like sort of amped up sweet and sour sauce. it was beyond gross. i didn't even finish it. i have an idea, 6 minute chinese. take an extra 6 or 7.... shooooot, i'll even wait 10 extra minutes.... and make your food edible.

<Content> I joined Yelp just to tell you to how horrible this place is. The delivery guy took well over an hour and a half to get here, and I live in a clearly marked apartment down the street. The order was half-wrong; I ordered mu-shu pork and got... pork liver with onion? Blegh. The orange chicken was edible but boring and ... something was off. Save your money.

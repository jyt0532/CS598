<Content> Great spot to grab a hot and fresh meal. You pay when you get your food but don't need to bus your own table. Seating is limited and I don't believe they serve alcohol. 5 stars for food, 3 stars for ambiance. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch or take out. We tried the beef bulgogi and the bibimbap. Both were delicious and were served with soup and pickled veggies.

<Content> Wasn't too bad. Don't expect the DIY Korean BBQ; it's very basic service with somewhat authentic dishes to satisfy your taste buds. I ordered the Bibimbap and it was fresh, however, the amount of beef was less than desirable (about two tablespoonfuls; seriously) so at $9.50, it was overpriced, especially for a hole in the wall. Also had boneless Kalbi and all I can say is weird, weird, weird. It was like Korean salisbury steak; two ground up beef rib meat, which is fatty and a strange gravy to top it off. Also way too over priced at $13.95. I can get something similar but real ribs at Aloha Grill in Chicago for $7. Im sure everything else here is ok, just stay away if its more than $10, esp the Kalbi. Yecchh.

<Content> i had high expectation for this place (going through all the yelp reviews), but the experience was just so so. I ordered the beef tofu ji gea, and it was pretty much just tofu and kimchi, only a few pieces thinly sliced beef?! i also got some kimba, they were just okay, nothing too special. But the rice was good, nice quality and very soft. the side dishes are all individually put into little containers ( i got my food carry out) which was nice. i dont know, i may come back this place for something else (the stir fry noodle dish looks pretty yummy) so yeah that's pretty much it :)

<Content> Note - I added the menu pages on the pictures sections, so feel free to reference those!Not a lot of inside seating nor is it super nice on the inside. Just a small little shack-type place in a plaza on the edge of campus. So why 5 stars? Because the Korean food here is as authentic and delicious as it gets. This place is for real. It is essentially run by this Korean lady who knows what she's doing. The stews and soups are excellent here, as is the bibimbap! I love coming here after work. A little taste of Korea right in Urbana.What would I recommend?- dolsot bibimbap (in stone bowl) - a Korean classic. - budejigae - a Korean everything stew- bulgogi - meat. Yes.- spicy pork bulgogi - similar to beef bulgogi, but it's spicy. My personal favorite!- spicy tofu soup (soon dubu) - really flavorful and can be spicy- donkatsu - fried pork cutlet. Yes.

<Content> This review is based on one dish (Sul Lung Tang) that I got for carry-out. Sul Lung Tang is one of my favorite soups and one of the best cures for hangovers (based on second-hand experiences).I grew up eating Korean food. I LOVE Korean food. My go-to Korean restaurant in Champaign is Bi-Won. I had tried all the other Korean restaurants (even the sushi restaurants owned by Koreans) except K-Bowl. A year or two ago, K-Bowl had a very limited menu, so I didn't give it a try. Seeing that their menu has expanded and reading really great reviews here on Yelp, I thought I should finally give it a try.I got Sul Lung Tang (ox bone soup). I knew it would not be the best (which is Han Bat's in L.A.), but I expected to actually get what I ordered. When I got home, I opened the container, and what did I smell? Man Doo Gook (dumpling soup)! Unmistakeably! There were measly, grisly, awful pieces of meat. Sweet potato noodles, which were appropriate. And EGG! Egg does not go in Sul Lung Tang. When I called K-Bowl, I asked the nice gentleman (with excellent English) if he gave me the right order. After I described the food, he talked to the cook, came back and told me, "That's how we make Sul Lung Tang".I told him that I have NEVER in my entire life had egg in this soup. (I've had this at restaurants in L.A., Korea, Chicago, Dallas, Fairfax, D.C....never.) He said, "Well, we put egg in it".Doubting my Korean-American judgment, I asked some Korean friends if egg goes in Sul Lung Tang. They confirmed no, never. Basically, this restaurant uses the same soup stock for two VERY different dishes. There's nothing wrong with using the same stock for multiple dishes. But one should never say something is something it absolutely isn't. It's a misrepresentation; it pains me to think that people who aren't familiar with Korean food may think that Sul Lung Tang is what is served at this restaurant.Don't get the Sul Lung Tang. I can't comment on the authenticity of any of the other dishes.

<Content> Champaign's best kept secret! Although completely out of the way for someone living in Urbana, I still make it a point to come here when I have the time. The shop is neatly tucked away in a small plaza and doesn't have a lot of floor and seating space available, but the food more than makes up for it. You get a full meal - rice, miso, pickled vegetables, the sides complement the main dish well. I usually get the spicy chicken bulgogi. Liberal amounts of gochujang paste are used, which gives the chicken and cabbage a rich but not overwhelming spicy and salty character. The spicy pork bulgogi, which looks to be more popular, is probably even better. The katsu is also fantastic and the bibimbap looks appealing. There's plenty to try and plenty of food given each time. I always leave satisfied!

<Content> I love Korean food and I am surprised I havent tried this place yet. I went here for lunch one summer day. I was bit taken aback that the place was so small. This is a pretty small place with just 5 tables. We had the sunduboo and bibimbap. The food was very good. The prices are right, for being an on-campus place. The only disappointment for me was that the dishes dont come with the assortment of "side dishes" that are always served at Korean restaurants. Highly recommend going here. I will definitely be back when I crave Korean food.

<Content> I've come to K-Bowl many times for the Korean food, and will do so again...it's very good. But other reviewers have covered that. What people may not be aware of is that they also have phenomenal chicken wings. I recommend the plain fried kind...it is definitely the best fried chicken I have had in C-U. It takes a while because it is freshly fried to order. But don't worry, it is worth the wait. It was so good that I had to go back and get it again the next day. I do not understand why this place is not full of people eating fried chicken all the time. Got a friend who's not a fan of Korean food, but you still want to eat together? Get em some fried wings, K-Bowl's got you covered.

<Content> My favorite dish here is spicy tofu (soondubu) because the broth is very flavorful--even more so than a lot of the chicago places. I was moving my stuff in and only place that was open and not many tables are available but he food simply trumps it all! So I personally like the take out from here. Especially at their reasonable prices, it's the best Korean on campus if not the Illinois area.

<Content> I've been here a few times, and I so far haven't tried anything other than the beef bulgogi and the spicy pork bulgogi. Both are really good! The spicy pork bulgogi is just the right amount of spicy for me. You get rice, the bulgogi, a side of kimchi, and miso soup. The place is really small, and doesn't have any atmosphere to speak of, so get it to go.Heads up: they're closed on Mondays.

<Content> I've driven by this place a few times and finally decided to try it out. I ordered Bi Bim Bap, since it is my favorite Korean food, and it was top and center on their menu. Everything about the dish was perfect. It was probably the most beautifully arranged Bi Bim Bap I've seen, which is rather surprising, as I got it to go. It had a lot of sesame flavor, and there were a lot of sesame seeds visible on it. The sauce (gochujong, I'm told) was probably the best chili paste I've ever had. The dish came with separate containers for rice, gochujong, kimchi, soy sauce, and even came with a side order of miso soup. Everything was fantastic.The woman who took my order didn't speak any English. But, all I needed to do to order was point. The restaurant has a couple bar-type seats, or you can get it to go. It took about 10 minutes for my food to be made, so it isn't the fastest fast food I've had, but it very well may be the best.

<Content> So far, everything we've tried has been great. Don't let the tiny size and modest decor fool you. Great, freshly prepared Korean fast and not so fast food. Everything is made after you order, so allow 10 or 15 minutes. It will be worth the wait.As someone else noted, much of the staff speaks poor (even no) English. So, if you know what you want and it is on the menu you will be fine just pointing to what you want. But, if you have a question about how something is prepared or what ingredients it may have, you might have problems unless you speak Korean. BUT, and this is important, other patrons may bail you out. Even the patrons have been friendly when we've visited. It seems that many of the patrons speak Korean as they sometimes engage in banter with the cashier; don't take this as a bad sign. When my wife had a question, the patron jumped right in translating her question, and then giving the answer back. Twice we've been invited to sit with other patrons (seating is quite limited). Does delicious Korean food make people happy? One could draw that conclusion. (But, the couple we were sitting with simply explained that this is the best Korean food in town, they like the owners and workers, and they want the place to do well so they are more than happy to help out and make it pleasant for everyone.) Your experience may vary, of course. Not everyone will be that friendly, and very often we've been the only patrons in the store. They take phone-in orders for take-out. I am guessing, but I suspect that this is most successful if you can speak Korean. Plus, I want to know what the specials are. We love the Spicy Squid-- not deep fried like the Chinese restaurants. It comes in a nice spicy red stew accompanied by rice. Also the Grilled Eel and the Spicy Seafood Steam are excellent. The family vegetarians have fewer choices, but the Vegetables Bibimbap, the fried noodles, and the vegetable fried rice have kept our resident vegetarian happy. It has an unfortunate location. A little too far for a lot of campus town residents to visit on foot, and a little too hidden for commuters (and the parking lot is a bit hard to get in and out of in traffic) . We visit when we think of it, but it has too little visibility for us to stop by on impulse. (We even end up at El Charro more often, and their parking is harder, but the store so much more visible so we're more likely to think of it when driving home after work.) Nonetheless, I think K-Bowl is a great addition to the local food scene. Not as fancy as B-Won, but a lot cheaper and as good or better food.

<Content> I don't really have strong feelings about this place one way or the other. I tried the bulgogi, beef noodle soup, and spicy pork. The bulgogi was good, the beef noodle soup was bland and the spicy pork was the best out of the three. If you are in the area and in the mood for Korean, then check this place out, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.

<Content> I'm very new to Korean food and decided to try K-bowl with a small group. The shop is really small and only had two workers so I was thinking, "Aw, the food will probably be so-so." I was wrong! I ordered the bibimbap which came with rice, miso soup, kimchi, yellow daikon, kimchi, and two sauces. The food was delicious and the presentation was great. My only regret is that I didn't have cash on me to leave a tip. Since they have take out and the price is very reasonable, I will definitely be going back regularly!

<Content> Superb bibimbap, very good Korean fried chicken. I'd say that the bibambap was the best in the area, whereas the wings / fried chicken take second place only to Star Karaoke. The prices are pretty good, and I'd rate the food better than Arirang, Spoon House, and Woori-Jib, all of which are also on Green Street. Unfortunately it's not the most convenient for students to get to, especially in summer when buses don't come as regularly.

<Content> It was our second time there. It was around 9pm after Illini game last week. Only two of us at that time. I always like Korean beef noodle soup and it was my first time ordering this dish at k bowl. The problem was where we sat, we could see the kitchen. We could see the stove. I saw the female chef cooking my soup and tasting it with a silver spoon. She tasted it with the silver spoon and then put the same spoon back to the soup and stirred it. At least 10 times. She even had the lady from the front to go into the kitchen to make sure the taste was fine. So basically there were two people trying my soup before handing it to me. When they gave me the soup and chef all the sudden came out and informed me that she forgot to put the beef in. So she had to take it back to cook more and taste more. Really? It's such a disaster. K bowl, I really want to like you, but it is not too much to ask to have a dish without your peoples tongues in it. Please respond. Thank you.

<Content> This place is a little out of the way. I wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't been walking right by it.The price is on par with the other places on campus. I was a bit skeptical of getting take out Korean, but I decided to go for it.I ordered the Soon Dubu JJigae (Tofu Soup) with pork and kimchi, and was pleasantly surprised. They put the soup in a huge styrofoam container - definitely enough for 2 meals. I loved the pork and the zucchini was a great addition. I'll probably go back soon!

<Content> I have been here about 5 times. Every time was amazing. I think they have the best Korean food in the CU area. We have gotten the soon doo boo chigae with kimchi pork, which is spicy and amazing and the dwenjang chigae which is also fabulous. Then I just noticed they had kamchatang (potato and pork soup), which I had been look for all over town. The flavors are spot on, and the kimchi is delish. The prices are competitive with other locations. This is my new favorite spot for Korean food.

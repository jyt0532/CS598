<Content> This about an average bar on Green Street. Most of their items are overpriced for the amount of food you actually get. However, every weekday, there's a special at night time special such as 0.50 pizza slices. This is most likely how they balance their prices: sell their food for expensive during the daytime and then sell them for super cheap during the late night. They're known for their chicken strips and I definitely have to say that the skin of the chicken tastes much different than other chicken strips I've ever had. It was hard to describe it; it tasted.... Artificial I guess is the best way I could describe it. If you're looking for late night food and/or alcohol, this is the place to be.

<Content> I ordered online for delivery, chicken strips, fries, 6ct hot wings. Total came out to $20.56 and was placed at 11pm. At midnight, I called to check on status of the order and was told that the driver was out with it but had no idea when it would be here. At 12:51am the drive arrived and said "Sorry for the lateness". Then food was cold, wings were dried up with little sauce dumped on them and the chicken strips were rubber. I called back to speak with the associate and request a credit back to my card as it was 2 hours and the food was not even edible. While simply explaining my situation the kid on the phone stopped me by saying "Fucking chill"! Then proceed to blame the driver saying that he told him to take our food to us first....he didnt even know who I was or what I ordered. I told him that I wanted to have my card credited back and to not tell me to "chill" and certainly DONT SWEAR at me. His response was "I dont see what you can do about it". I asked to speak to his manager and he informed me that HE WAS THE GENERAL MANAGER! I asked him to spell his last name and his reply was that he doesnt have to tell me anything and if I want a credit it is up to the "online people".I called and placed a complaint to the customer service number provided and was told it would be taken down and her manager would contact me. It is 2am...nothing came of the situation except that I threw the food out. Here is a fair warning, the actions of this individual will be brought forth in legal action towards the business. Im not a college kid calling from a dorm, and regardless of the situation SOMEONE WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS TREATMENT!

<Content> Worst restaurant ever!!! They delivered to me about 10 times and every time I order the mozzarella sticks. I live less than half a mile from there restaurant. So after all the times they've delivered to me I call to place an order. And the MANAGER says we will NOT DELIVER TO YOU because you don't tip. When I actually do tip. I tip about 18% of the bill. Which mozzarella sticks cost $8.99 on there website and we they deliver the total comes to about 14.00 that's crazy. But I usually tip about $2.00. Also I ordered mozzarella sticks from my neighbors address and they didn't even cook them thoroughly and the manager says put them in the microwave. WORST SERVICE EVER THIS RESTAURANT NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN  . THE MANAGER IS AN ASSHOLE. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL ENOUGH TO THINK THAT SOMEONE REALLY LIKES THERE FOOD ENOUGH TO ORDER AGAIN AFTER BEING TOLD THEY WOULD NOT DELIVER TO ME. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. ID RATHER GET MY FOOD OUT OF A TRASH CAN THAN TO ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN.

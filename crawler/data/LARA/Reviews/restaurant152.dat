<Content> AMAZING LUNCH SPECIALS! I've heard both Bombays and Casablanca are both owned by the same people: but Bombay is the place to go for lunch! You and a buddy could get away splitting a dish for $8. Very cool! The food is pretty good. Not the best in town (Casablanca or that new one in Urbana is better), but good enough for a quick lunch.

<Content> I ordered my food online with my credit card at about 6:30 PM. At 8PM, I called Bombay Indian Grill, and asked about the status of my food. I was told that the delivery guy should be picking up soon.Around 9PM, I called again. This time I was told I had to call delivery.com. I tried calling, and no one picks up. Around 9:30PM, I get a call from the delivery person. When I go to take my food, he says, "you're supposed to pay with cash." I explained that I already paid via yelp's link for online delivery with my credit card. He said, "it says you are paying with cash." I proceed to stand there for fifteen minutes, while he calls various people to finally get to the number to call to confirm my method of payment. He says, "do you have your credit card?" I respond, "no." He says, "you'll need it because they're going to want to confirm the payment." Mind you, I am in the law building. My stuff is on the other side of the law building. I am not wandering around looking for my credit card, while he calls people to confirm my payment. I just stood there. At one point, I said, just void this I don't want it. Then my hunger snapped me back to my senses. After some time on the phone, he is told I paid with my credit card already. I told him I would not be using their services again, he said "okay." He walked out unaffected. Around 10 PM, I called the number on delivery.com, and heard no apologies. Thanks Bombay Grill, for providing me with the distinct pleasure of paying $23 to have cold mutter paneer and wilted garlic naan delivered to me more than 2.5 hours after I ordered it. The lack of silverware and napkins was a nice touch.Thanks delivery.com, for demonstrating that incompetence and a lack of care is possible at all levels of an organization.

<Content> Restaurant reviewHmm Indian food selection is very limited in Champaign so I was excited to eat at Bombay again since my medical school days. I had only been here once with my wife for dinner and the food was pretty spicy. The lunch special seemed enticing for 7+ dollars depending on what you order. I wish I took a picture of the menu, maybe next time. The chicken curry I ordered took a bit of time to prepare but it came out piping hot. The curry was not spicy at all which was perfect. It was rich and creamy with ample amount of chicken. The naan was simply the largest naan I have ever seen. It was perfect with the curry. You also get a potato pakora. No salad though as mentioned previously. All and all great, but if you could pay a dollar or two more for buffet at someplace else I probably would go with that for variety. The only downside of this place is that they use plastic ware and plates, but I guess this is a college town after all and I have to lower my standards. Pro: large menu with lunch specials, large naan, not too spicy curryCons: plasticware, slow serviceHidden gem: 7+ dollar lunch specials with large naan or rice and potato pakora

<Content> Food was pretty average. Waitress was pleasant. I ordered the mixed grill. It was all chicken. Where was the mix that was on the menu?!? $15.99 for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain. No rice. Burnt naan. I will return to Puran in Bloomington:)

<Content> I was a little reluctant to try this place out but after getting a thumbs up from my Indian friend, I finally gave in. It is quite a small place with 20 or less small tables. I was there with 5 other friends and found that it is particularly hard to find a table that was big enough to accommodate all of us, especially during lunch time.I was surprised when I tasted their food because I thought it was gonna be really bad. It turned out to be okay although it wasn't excellent. I love their paneer makhani because the sauce was wonderfully creamy but oddly, the paneer tasted like tofu to me. I also had their lentil curry and briyani rice but that weren't as good. You have a choice of a huge naan or rice for lunch specials I think. I'd go for the NAAN if I were you.Expect to spend at least $7 or $8 for vegetarian dishes and more for meats. For the amount of food that they give, the prices are a little steep in my opinion. It's usually the naan that fills me up, not the curry.Updated 5/10/08:I was there for dinner and I realized that it was a completely different experience in the evening. For lunch, you order your food and pay at the cash register. When the food is ready, they will serve it to you in styrofoam plates and plastic cutleries. For dinner, it becomes a sit-down restaurant with table service, cute waitresses, and food served on china and silverware. A stark difference, eh?

<Content> I think this place is pretty good and affordable. It beats the other Indian joint in town. The only drawback is that it's not very clean (flies may be buzzing around as you eat) and it's very hot in the summer (their air conditioning sucks). So I would not recommend going there on a hot humid day. I would also not recommend going there with a large group.. as other reviews have suggested, the place is not big. Waiter service ONLY at night.Anyhoo... there are many choices you can make but not all are good. I like the chicken mekhani (aka butter chicken) or lamb biryani (aka lamb and fried rice.. but it's delish). If you are accustomed to Indian food or want to be more adventurous then I would suggest the saag paneer (spinach and cheese), spinach and chicken dish, eggplant dish (I believe it's called bengan bartha), or gobi aloo (cauliflower and potatoes). I'm not a fan of the tandoori chicken.Oh they also have this naan (which is like pita bread) with lamb in it. I forgot what it's called but I've tasted it and it's pretty good.Well worth a visit if you want to try something different.

<Content> This is the best Indian food you'll find in Urbana-Champaign. Growing up in India and spending more than a decade in New Jersey, I have had luxury of trying out Indian food at many places (incl. home!!). The taste of the food is authentic, not too spicy, but not at all bland. True art of Indian food is to use variety of herbs and spices in a way that it enhances the taste of food, but doesn't dominate the overall taste. Many Indian restaurants either are afraid of using spices or carelessly overdo it.  Bombay Grill nails that aspect, so it gets five stars from me. Besides the taste, the food isn't that expensive for an Indian restaurant standard. We tried weekday buffet last week. For $11 + tip + tax, it had enough varieties. Some really good, some right on mediocrity, which is very common with buffet. Their butter chicken and tandoori roast chicken are worth trying. Saag paneer is phenomenal for those interested in vegetarian options. Lunch buffet had probably the best naan I've tried in many years. They are freshly baked and new ones keep coming worm and fluffy from the kitchen. Judging from the buffet food, I can confidently say that a la carte items would be a bang for your buck too!!Next time will try dinner and see if it's equally satisfying as the lunch buffet.

<Content> Best Indian food in Champaign ....From chats to curries, I love it all. My favorites were papdi chat, samosa chat ... but I have tried all appetizers. Chicken saag is just out of world, I love the creamy texture, freshness it has, I have had it in many places, but this place does the best. I miss this place truly.

I had the Chicken Vindaloo which had a nice flavor but was lacking in heat. The naan was nice but just slightly burnt. I would go back if I was in champaign and jonesin for some indian food, but i wouldnt seek it out as a fantastic restaurant

<Content> I LOVE THIS PLACE! Prior to trying out Bombay Indian Grill, I had only tried Indian food once and I absolutely despised it. But when I came down to Champaign I knew I had to give it a second shot and Bombay Indian Grill was the place that stole my heart. Their samosas are crispy and cooked to perfection, their buttery naan is amazing, and their Chicken Makhani was so so good. I wish it was a more spicier dish but it was still delicious with tons of flavor. The waiters are always attentive and friendly - if not too friendly. This place gets busy quickly so go earlier or later than a usual meal time but beware of the 3-5 closing time because I had gone between those times not knowing they closed and I was really disappointed. Learn from my mistake!

<Content> This place used to be much better, it really has gone downhill in the past year. Perhaps the best comment I can muster is that it's definitely better than Ambar, which is really not saying a whole lot. But if you must have Indian food, and have no possible way of getting to Race St. in Urbana for good Indian food, then I recommend Bombay Grill.

<Content> For my grad program I have to spend a few weeks in Champaign every year. When I'm there, I go to this place all the time. The food is great, and it's really cheap at lunch - for $6.99 you can get an enormous amount of your entree, plus either the biggest piece of naan in history OR a giant pile of rice OR some of both, plus a couple pakoras and a salad. What? Fabulous. And it is more than enough food to last for two meals, which is another huge plus.In case that weren't enough, they frequently give me free stuff. I don't totally understand why. I'm not really a regular, and I'm not a supermodel. If this place were on the east coast, I'd guess it was because I'm polite, but this is Champaign, where everyone says "please" and "thank you" and smiles. So...I don't really understand it, but every time I go there, I get some of another entree, or an extra piece of naan, or a dessert, or a soda. Maybe everybody gets free stuff. Whatever. I'm not one to look a gift daal in the mouth.

<Content> Totally solid, no-frills Indian food. The lunch specials are affordable and come with rice/naan (THE LARGEST PIECE OF NAAN YOU'VE EVER SEEN), salad, and a veggie pakora - for under $10. Yes, please!I've only been to the 1st Street location once, but from what I've tasted, the food is basically the same here. Creamy chicken tikka masala (my fave, I'm a gringo, I know) with crispy, buttery naan, mmm. I tried my boyfriend's Lamb Saag dish and loved it also.Why is the lunch so affordable? Because it's a really small place (the tables are tightly-packed in), there's no waiter service, and your meal is served on Styrofoam. This is Indian food for poor college students. If you want a more relaxed, "restaurant-y" atmosphere (and don't mind paying a few extra dollars), head over to the Bombay Grill on 1st. But if, like me, you are in grad school and up to your ass in student loan debt, this is the place for you.

<Content> I absolutely think that Bombay Grill has the best chicken mahkani. No restaurants in Chicago (even on Devon) can compare! Or maybe I just haven't found that one perfect place in the city yet...So anyways, when I was an undergrad, I luckily lived across the street from Bombay so I would come here all the time. The manager knew me by my first name, hahahahha that was embarassing. Yes their prices can be a little expensive but I think it's worth it. I love their garlic naan too. What I hate about all indian restaurants is that everything is always separate--- naan, rice, etc. Blah.Anyways, A+ for Bombay!

<Content> This restaurant is a great deal for dinner! For two entrees and an appetizer, the check was about $26, which is pretty good for two people -- and we were stuffed. The food is delicious, the portions are decent, our glasses were always filled with water, and service was prompt.Only two negatives, no liquor license and the atmosphere is a bit lacking. It was a little too loud and a little too crowded, but it's a good place for casual dining.

<Content> This place makes no qualms about itself. It is a solid Punjabi joint, creamy curries, paneer and all. That said, it's rather lacking in spicy inspiration - both locations didn't feature any sort of kick to their curries. However, the lunch special is all bang for your buck...I recently went here on a lunch meeting and my professor and I were able to split one plate and leave completely stuffed! I'm glad the only real traditional Punjabi Indian joint in C-U isn't a disaster, but it's nothing to write home about either!

<Content> I reviewed this in 2009 to let people know that I got food poisoning here. I ate here again and am rating it more highly cause I ate the veg food and it was fine, but mostly because I highly approve of the quantity and quality of their rice. Working class Asian Americans like myself love their rice and this place is super generous and the quality is very very good. Better than the entree itself in fact.

<Content> There is a long standing debate between my friends and I over the best Indian restaurant on Green street. Unlike Chinese food here, there isn't much competition, so it's basically Bombay vs. East and West. East and West is completely vegetarian and leans towards Southern Indian style snacks, whereas Bombay Grill has heartier food and has a more formal dinner.I think some of their dishes are a little overspiced, but the Tandoori chicken is absolutely divine with a crisp skin and the perfect amount of seasoning. I only wish it came with more chicken and less of the lentil side and gigantic naan. Don't get me wrong, the naan here is great, but more of that chicken would be better. The service is quite slow and it is pretty expensive, so I reserve going here for when I really need a treat.

<Content> I've been to Bombay Indaian Grill a couple of times now and everything I've had there was delicious. I've gotten the Bengan Bartha (spicy eggplant) and Aloo Gobi (cauliflower with potatoes), both of which were very tasty with a side of naan bread. The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4 is because the food is overpriced: $10 for a small cup of stewed vegetables and naan bread... Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.Overall, I like the food there but because I don't like feeling ripped off, I probably won't come back too often, unless I'm in the vicinity and have an extreme craving for Indian food.

<Content> Tasty food. My favorite was always chicken makhani. Sometimes the manager would give me additional nan (some kind of pita bread but much more tasty) for free. The price is low and you will always end up as full as it gets.Seating was sometimes a problem because the place is kind of small, and it is so good that it gets crowded.I moved away from Chambana to the south west. I have been in some other indian restaurants but no one compares to Bombay Grill regarding taste. I miss it.

<Content> I have no pretensions to being an expert on Indian fare, but Bombay does what it's supposed to do: fill your belly in a reasonable fashion while remaining tasty. The naan is fluffy and delicious, and any of the chicken dishes (I've tried several), are excellent. However, the lunch rush is pretty intense, and the staff make no bones about letting you know that they are not there to indulge in your lunch hour relaxation. Expect to see your plates taken away and your table cleaned as a *hint* to mosey on along, partner. Seriously, a bit awkward to have my table wiped down in mid-sentence. Still, decent food for what it is, a tiny lunch factory in Campus Town.

<Content> Really great Indian food, just a few blocks from campus. For a quick lunch, it's a great amount of excellent food for a good price. Their naan is fresh and flavourful, and they were great at customizing spiciness levels for the various American/Indian palates in our party. A little bit of a small restaurant, their second location on 1st is bigger and features a lunch buffet for the less-adventurous. However, the Green St. location had a variety of great food options, and a Himalayan chicken special that was divine. Great place to meet and catch up, but can get crowded when students/classes are in session.

<Content> Mediocre Indian food. I eat Indian food in almost every town I go to and even had it catered at my wedding so I would consider myself somewhat of an Indian food connoisseur. Having said that, there's not much selection in this town.Samosas chat were flavorful. Our entrees were just okay. I ordered lamb korma which baaarely had a korma taste. To be honest, I forgot that that was the dish I was eating. The curry was very thin. I don't remember what my husband ordered but its flavor was very heavy on the tomato. Like a tomato soup almost. The lamb itself was delicious, but the overall dish was borderline disappointing. They didn't offer spice levels on the food. It wasn't bland per se, but it was more like amateur night than the real deal. The best part of the meal was the appetizer and the naan. It was reasonably priced though.It was also super noisy. Don't know if I'll go back, but I had to try it for myself to see if it was any good.

<Content> Well, the first week I went here somehow I ended up going three times. I really like the food here. I wouldn't say I'm a connoisseur of Indian food, but it tastes really good to me, and they really do give you a ton. I had the biryani the other day and I was able to eat it for three more meals. The only complaint I might have is that it's a little expensive. (I'd rather have less food and pay less money) Also, I love really spicy food. I've learned my lesson in the past--don't tell Indian or Thai restaurants that you want the food spicy or you might not be able to eat for a week. But I feel like the food here is just not that hot. One exception was this one appetizer...it had big old chunks of jalapeno. Pretty tasty! I'd love to come back.

Food was ot worth more than $6 however we were shocked to see their heavy check. Food is not so tasty to admire. It doesnt have the true authentic Indian food taste. They make sides of potatoes and green peas which are cheap in market to keep their profit margin high. They are smart enough to rob people. Please try other Indian restaurant who give you many option to eat for less than $10.

<Content> Let me start by saying, I NEVER had a bad meal at the location on Green Street.However, the problem started when Bombay moved into the old Basmati's restaurant on 1st.For all intents and purposes, this restaurant is Basmati's all over again. The decor was exactly the same. The waiters seemed to be the same too. However, would we still have the same bland food that made Basmati my least favorite restaurant?Well, yes and no.Even with an expanded area for cooking and serving, the food is identical to the location on Green Street. Wait, no, not identical. The main courses cost about $3.00 more than on Green Street.Of course there's the addition of alcohol on the menu, but the location on 1st doesn't afford you the great meal at a low price that the Green Street location was so good at.

<Content> Bombay has been one of my favorite restaurants in Champaign for almost 5 years. It's dark and cozy inside and smells of masala and fresh yogurt. It seems to be popular, too, because every time I have gone it has been absolutely packed -- but I've never had to wait long for a table, and usually there is no wait at all. They also give you so much food, and I always have enough left over for lunch the next day. Great selection of vegetarian entrees, too, for those that are into that!

<Content> Nicely seasoned paneer and enormous naan. Very good and reasonably priced. Only con is that they serve it on styrofoam plates which isn't very environmentally friendly. I'd be back once a week or two if I lived on Champaign.

<Content> The food isn't terrible. That is the best I have to say. We cook Pakistani and North Indian food at home all the time, which is what this ostensibly is. Every damn dish tastes the same here. This type of food is supposed to be rich and nuanced, and every dish should have its own set of flavors that make it unique. I really wonder if they just have a base curry sauce in the kitchen, and throw whatever combination of meat and veg in when they get the order. I'd rather eat my own versions, thank you very much, and I'm not even the desi half of the household!Go to Annapoorna grocery, buy some spice box mixes, follow the instructions on the back, and you'll probably do better.

<Content> I've eaten at a lot of Indian places and I love Indian food. I must say, I was very pleased with this place, especially given its location. The food was delicious and pretty authentic. I gave it four stars because the service was so-so and there was no ice in the water.

<Content> LOVE it! MUCH better than some of the CU alternatives when it comes to Indian food. I recommend the saag paneer, and they have DELICIOUS naan.

<Content> I would highly recommend the lamb curry which is spicy and comes with fragrant basmati rice. The naan is really great too. I also enjoy the aloo tikki appetizer, as well as the samosas. I am not an expert on Indian food so I can't tell you how authentic it is, but I can tell you that it is delicious.

<Content> This is one of my favorite places in CU. Their Naan is the best Naan of all Naans I've had - and I've had a lot of Naan. Chicken Tikka and Lamb Curry are my favorites. With a mango lassi expect to pay around 15 bucks after tax and tip.

<Content> The food here is tolerable but the "thinks he's better than you" waiter makes it not at all worth it. He literally throws things on the table, doesn't make eye contact, and is never friendly. They'd have a 3 for the food if it wasn't such bad service. I even got take out once and it was the same reaction. I'm done!

<Content> Sub-par Indian food, which passes in town. How is that there is no good Indian food in Champaign-Urbana? There are so many amazing Korean and Chinese places. The food here is generic and bland. Not worth the money.

<Content> Ok, I am a food snob from Los Angeles. Just moved here and to be totally honest I think the food here is so plain. Yes, you have a lot of great steak places and American food but things such as Sushi ( there is NO good places I have tried each and every one) and Indian are hard to come by. We first went to Basmati and honestly I thought we were doomed. There was no flavor and most dishes seemed to be watered down. NOW, we were driving near campus and we drove by Bombay and I am more then happy we stopped. As for the other poster whos friends said its over spiced, have you tried real Indian food? This is tame in comparison. The food is just right and always served fresh and hot. The semosas are great and served with the best sauces. We love the Gobi Aloo and chicken masala, we will be back to try other dishes. Bottom line other then the lackluster decor and sometimes dirty looking floors this place was a sweet treat for those of us who are used to some variety!

<Content> This is probably my favorite place to eat in C-U. I come from Boston, the land of 100 Indian restaurants. I fell in love with Indian there, and was very wary of moving to a tiny midwestern city. However, Bombay definitely hits the spot. I like the typical curry dishes, chicken tikka masala, samosas, naan - all are great here. My husband is a bit more adventurous and he has never been disappointed. Granted, it's not better than many of the places we've been to in Boston - but it's way better than I expected for around here! On the down side, it's pretty small and very crowded around lunch time. Good luck finding space for more than just 2 at noon!

<Content> I think for cheap Indian, it's hard to do better given its city (C-U). It's not top shelf Chicago/big city Indian or anything, but it's very good. In particular, I think this location is better than their sit down restaurant, as it serves very similar food but is noticeably cheaper. I've had a lot of different dishes here and wasn't really disappointed with anything. Particular favorite is the saag paneer and spicy chana aloo.

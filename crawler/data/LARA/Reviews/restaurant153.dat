<Content> Geo's chicken strips are one of those things that I hope stays the same forever and ever and ever and ever. Yes, you'll probably regret eating them. And no, they'll never make a Top Ten Healthy Foods list, but oh well. I made my way back there recently and laughed at all the people who didn't order honey mustard with their strips. Fools. I don't even like honey mustard, but I think I could drink a whole bottle of Geovanti's. Ew, ok maybe not, but I hope that explains how good it is.There are other things on their menu, and I've had some of them. And that's about all I have to say about that.

<Content> This place closed and it's Papa D's now but from what I understand they still serve the same food. Those chicken tenders are a force to be reckon with. This one drunk girl I was trying to take home and make sure she got there safely was like "let's get chicken fingers, they are amazing! the best you'll ever have" and I thought "yeahok" but then I had them and holy AF they were and are the best I've ever had.However, the food is always a gamble. It's always different, the people who work there are in arguments, I've seen fist fights with customers (which was awesome btw), and they ignored our delivery orders twice. Another time they came with the food and asked us why we ordered to go when we were so close. We said we didn't want to go out in the cold and she scoffed at us. Pretty funny overall, the food was great that night, but yeah. Rude staff + Amazing food = Dinner and a show. Fights with drunk/stupid customers never get old.

<Content> I've only ever gotten their chicken fingers combo. The chicken is freaking fantastic - golden and crispy on the outside, hot and tender on the inside. Get them with the honey mustard sauce and you are in flavor country, my friend.The fries are kind of meh. Really, it's all about the chicken. I have to knock them a couple stars because they serve everything in styrofoam. And because the restaurant doesn't have A/C. You'll probably want to have them deliver.

<Content> I made the mistake of reading the reviews of this place and deciding to order food online. I had eaten at Geovanti's once before and was underwhelmed to say the least. But who can turn down amazing chicken strips? WELL, it took over an hour and a half to get the order and once it arrived, it was soggy and lukewarm. Yuck. I can tell you that I will never order from Geovanti's again.If you are at the restaurant, its 2 am, and you're drunk, then the food here is ok and the wait for it won't seem too long. Under those conditions, I say go for it. Otherwise, stay away.

<Content> Geovanti's has one of the best chicken strip. THE CHICKEN STRIPS ARE GINORMOUS! I almost ordered the five chicken strips and my boyfriend gave me a weird look because I had no idea how huge these chicken strips are. I recommend getting the 2 or 3 strips with a combo which comes with a drink and fries. Also get the honey mustard sauce and you're game! However the fries aren't that great and lacks flavor. I can imagine how amazing this meal could be after a night at the bars, but the line gets crazy after 12am. My boyfriend ordered the gyro sandwich which is also a good choice and you can't go wrong with that. Overall, the service is mediocre. It's good when the workers are in a good mood. It's bad when the workers are pissed off at some stupid drunk. However, I wouldn't order this too often or you might die of an heart attack or a clogged artery because these babies are drenched in grease. I mean, any food that's unhealthy and covered in grease has to taste good. HAPPY EATING!

<Content> I've only really been to Geovanti's a couple times in the past, and I remember them having pretty good calzones in the past. I believe it is under new ownership (by a friend of a friend, interestingly) who have been trying to make some improvements. The chicken tenders were recommended to me, and they themselves were pretty good - they're certainly enormous, and they were fresh fried (since they took a while to come out). The batter is interesting - not your KFC style crunchy batter, but almost like a funnel cake batter, not in the taste, but in the appearance after it comes out of the fryer. I made the mistake of selecting BBQ sauce, which in this case is like a terrible sweet and sour sauce...it almost tastes of cinnamon, and that's not what I want in BBQ sauce. Ranch would be better. As another reviewer has mentioned, the basement is TINY and that's where the action is. Additionally, the night I was there last, a just OK band was playing awkward covers (Gin Blossoms? Really?) at absolutely unbelievable volumes. So maybe it's not the bar I would pick first (at least, not on a Thursday night). They were also charging cover, I assume for the band, which kept me out.

<Content> It is true, other than the chicken strips this place sucks. I've had the pizza here, it's just okay, nothing you can't get at Papa Johns or Domino's though. My sister had the Italian Beef from here and said it wasn't good either. BUTTTT....You must not discredit this establishment solely because of this fantastic, ORGASMIC, delicious fried creation they refer to as chicken strips! Here are some tips for ordering:- If you're intoxicated in some form, you may be able to order the 5 piece, but if you are sober don't even bother trying more than three.- Ordering at night? Do delivery rather than take out. Delivery is actually relatively good on campus. Take-out is a nightmare late night due to the fact Geo's seconds as a bar in addition to all the other drunkards that come in off of Green Street .- Ask for extra crispy. Unfortunately delivery can result in a soggy product, and some how even when you take-out from the restaurant the fries still end up being soggy, so again... EXTRA CRISPY- For side-sauces I suggest either their ranch or honey mustard...both very good!I feel like this restaurant would be a lot more efficient if they only did Chicken Strips because they wouldn't have to deal with the other bullshit they make.

<Content> I find myself in Champaign for a quick 3 hour meeting and I remember a coworker is an U of I grad. He must know where I should go eat and he texts me back saying Zas, Papa Dells and Geovantis. He wasn't sure if Zas was still around, and I wasn't in a deep dish mood. One look at Yelp mobile and all I see are written down are Chicken Fingers, Chicken fingers, and chicken fingers. So I come. word to wise, if you think you are hungry for 12 fast food size Chicken strips, order 5 here. They're that big.  If they had better beer on tap, and buffalo sauce, this would be 5 stars. You're almost there Geos! I wonder how many people come in late night stoned with the munchies.....

<Content> Geovanti's is the best place on campus to get your deep fried grease fix. Don't expect health food or vegetarian options, because the very blue-collar cooks throw everything in the deep fryer. This place bills itself as a "bar and grill," but the nightlife is mediocre at best. On Friday night, usually there are usually 3 or 4 guys in the basement bar, sipping cheap American light beer.

<Content> The chicken fingers really are as good as they say. Unfortunately, they aren't very consistent and can sometimes be overfried and burnt. I've also tried a calzone.... it was MASSIVE but it was a strange yellow color that was pretty off-putting. It was pretty cheesy but did not taste very good at all.

<Content> OK, another bad Geovanti's experience, again!This time I ordered a "famous" calzone. However, the servbice is still sooo slow. Aprrox. 15 mins after my order, I asked the guy on the cashier about the situation, and he told me back "It'll be ready in 2 mins" and after another 15 mins, he said the calzone is ready. Gee...Also, I do not recommend you to go there for a "dine-in" dinner, coz people usually have a party in downstairs and make noise... your dinner would become a disaster...PS: The taste of calzone is nearly perfect, but it doesn't change my thoughts about this place.Thumbs down!!! Again!!! Unfortunately!!!

<Content> I really do like their chicken strips. My previous review is still accurate, but the last time I went, the management change shows and the new service staff is slow and inefficient. The place was always borderline sketchy, but with the new folks it seems to have plummeted and I recently saw their Champaign county restaurant inspection reports, and they have been failing them with pretty egregious offenses.Don't get me wrong, most restaurants have issues and even fail these inspections, but issues with hot water, spoiled foods, and pests....I won't be headed back anytime soon.

<Content> I second what everyone else says about the chicken strips, and ESPECIALLY the honey mustard-- it was the best I have ever had.I, on the other hand, got the italian beef. 4.99 + .50 for a slice of cheese and .50 for some spicy giardinara = a meal that was HUGE, delicious, and I'm pretty sure I used about 18 napkins to finish. I'm used to paying a lot more than $6 for ITB that's a lot smaller than their portions, but if you don't like yours super wet, you might want to say that-- mine had jus pooled in the bottom that we started dunking fries in after the honey mustard ran out.I'm not sure I'd spend a night here drinking, but man the food is a great value.

<Content> This was one of my top places to go on campus. It's cheap, the food is delicious and you get EXTREMELY large portions. I probably have tried everything on their menu from one time to another and they definitely do a better job with certain dishes than others. But the ones they do well can't be beat. The Top 5 things are: 1. Chicken Fingers - These things are the sizes of your forearm and come with a great honey mustard sauce. Bet you can't finish a 5-piece! 2. Gyro - I love their gyro's! Even though you have Zorba's and Niro's Gyros close by I would still go with Geo's if not just for their shear size! You can fill up just on eating off the top of the pile of meat before even making it to the pita bread! 3. Calzones - They have so many different ones to choose from but I would say the Fighting Illini, the Italiano, and the Steak Bomb top the list. Again, these things are massive so be prepared for leftovers! 4. Baked Mostaccioli - Amazing pasta dish with a layer of melted cheese across the top! I would recommend getting it with meat sauce and some sausage or meatballs in there as well. 5. Godfather Sandwich - Don't settle for the regular Italian Beef or you are just shorting yourself for no reason. With the Godfather you get a huge Italian beef with melted cheese on GARLIC bread. So good! The only downside with this place is you have to be ready for a wait if you're going around dinner time or after the bars close because it gets packed. But at the same time you know it's good if there's a line out the door every night! I miss you Geovanti's!

<Content> Honestly, seriously and absolutely the best freakin' chicken fingers I have ever had. They measure about 6" x 2" and are always hot, golden brown and delish! Their honey mustard is on the mayonaisey side, but makes a good compliment to the biggest chicken fingers on the planet. The bar in the basement has cheap pitchers/good drink specials and that is pretty much all I have to say about that.Minus one star for the basement bar inspiring claustrophobia that I didn't know I had.

<Content> The chicken fingers are exactly as good as advertised. They're the only reason I still order from this place. Other than that, it's fairly crappy.I've had them lose my order before.I've called in an order and been told they were "Out of lettuce."I've ordered a Caesar salad and been treated to a container of stale iceberg lettuce. I sort of hate the place.However, I love the chicken fingers so much I still order from Geovanti's once a month or so. They're good enough for me to sometimes ignore how bad everything else is.

<Content> the first time i came here, my cousin suggested the chicken strips and fries (and i've never gotten anything else since). i'm thinking chicken strips, no big deal; i'll get five and some fries and that should hold me over til late night.i proceeded to order five strips and fries, and his friend working the counter looked at me, then at him and said, "seriously, you're going to let him do that? you're a real asshole."two strips and half an order of fries into the bounty, i am beyond full and taking the rest home, feeling like less of a man. but sweet jesus, are they good. now my cousin works there and hooks me up when i'm in town. even so, i still only politely ask for two and fries. i don't want anyone to think he's still an asshole. :)

<Content> I needed to order catering for an event at work. A coworker called to pay for the order, and was told that they "don't have alfredo sauce." She then passed it it back to me so I could reconfigure my order.I'm sorry, but what kind of Italian restaurant doesn't have alfredo sauce before their dinnertime rush starts? It's a white sauce. MAKE some. It's not hard. If it's too difficult to make some, perhaps you should run out and buy some. I have a feeling that not everyone who went to Geovantis that night was satisfied with their one option: Marinara sauce.But I digress. On with the story...This is a phone conversation that actually happened between me and a Geovantis staff member:Me: Hi, I'm calling back about my order--my coworker tells me you don't have alfredo sauce? SM: Oh, right! No, we don't.Me: ....Like, you don't have it ever, or you're just out for today?SM: Yeaaah, we're just out today.Me: Oh...okay. So, I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo because it's vegetarian. What else, aside from the cheese tortellini (which I'd already ordered) is vegetarian?SM: Umm....hold on. *puts me on hold for a few minutes* We can make stuff vegetarian for you?Me: Oh, no, that's okay. Let's just make it two cheese tortellinis, then.SM: Okay! One cheese tortellini, one cheese ravioli...Me: No, no, you don't have to make cheese ravioli special, since it's not on your menu. Two cheese tortellinis will be fine!SM: Oh, okay. *Proceeds to spend a few minutes figuring out the rest of my order until I confirm that it's correct.* Now, what kind of sauce do you want on the Chicken Parmesan?Me: .....I'm sorry? SM: What kind of sauce do you want on your Chicken Parmesan? Me: What do you mean? Isn't it marinara sauce?SM: Yeah, you can either get marinara sauce, or alfredo sauce.Me: ...........Considering that you don't have alfredo sauce, I guess it would have to be marinara sauce.SM: Oh! Yeah! Right!Seriously. That sound you hear is of me banging my head against the wall.And the food is only okay.But, if you like the food, the portions are really cheap and HUGE.

<Content> Great pizza on mondays deal!4.99 for a large pizza with cheese off of EatCu.comI got a large with half steak and half italian beef.Let me say, it was the most delicious hearty pizza I have ever had for 6 bucks. I usually get Papa Johns large pineapple for 5 bucks, but it gets old. This is good "Italian" pizza. (as italian as they say they are.)Anyway, I keep reading all these rave reviews about the chicken tenders, and as I waited for my pizza, multiple people came in and ordered those chicken tenders, so they must be good.But back to my pizza, it was AMAZING. I took 2 slices and and im not even hungry anymore. THis baby is gonna last me for the rest of the night and at least 1 slice for breakfast tomorrow.5/5 stars A+

<Content> Oh boy, what a crazy place this is. Large portions, reasonable prices, varying quality, weird staff, dingy place, cheap drinks in the basement. I've heard people rave and dis it - the only thing I have first hand experience with is the chicken tenders. I'm something of a chicken tenders/strips conisseur (sp?). They do homemade chicken strips with a batter that's not too far off from the kind at Chilli's, almost like a tempura type of thing. When they're good, they give esquire a run for best around. Too often though, the tempura-mental batter puffs up like a corndog and soaks up too much grease - my theory is that they just don't keep the oil hot enough. i've basically sworn it off because of this inconsistency. Also, the honey mustard is like some funky yellow mayonaise. Blech!

The only thing I ever really got there was the baked mostaccioli, and it was soooo delicious and so so so so cheap ($5.95 for a full, which is definitely more worth it than the half for a dollar cheaper or so) and they give you such a big portion that it lasts you days and days and it still tastes so good when you microwave it up!! Their garlic bread's not the best, but it's edible and again, I can't stress how much I love that baked mostaccioli!!!!

Ordered 5 piece chicken strips and fries tonight... They were overbooked, greasy and tasted of old grease. They forgot the fries and delivered them35 minutes later.. Greasy, lukewarm and also tasting of old grease. The only reason I gave them more than 1 star is because we had good food from there in the past. Don't order delivery.

Thank you girl on quad and outside of Follett's passing out Illini coupon books.Must eat the night of. Not so tasty the next day unless you put in oven. Order ahead of time if possible.

<Content> This place doesn't need another chicken strip review, they are amazing and I will not knock them on that.  I would not recommend the pizza though,. I had a coupon for a free pizza around September 2011, I was absolute shit. It may have been due to the fact that it was free, but I would not pay a single American dollar for one in the future ever. The actual place is pretty dive. The bar downstairs is dark and dingy, I would not go there willingly. Dining in is pretty meh, it's usually hot and sticky. If you do make your way to Geo's for the chicken strips, get them to go, you wont be disappointed.

<Content> I like Bobo. They have really authentic Chinese food. Best on campus. Off campus is Tang Denisty. If you are not from south/southeast part of China, you will definitely agree with me.

<Content> This is a review of Bobo China's hot pot.I've had hotpot a few times here. It is generally not bad, but you really have to pester the waiter to get anything. However, the restaurant is really lacking in the cleanliness department. The tables are sticky to the touch. For what its worth, I have heard some terrible things about their buffet, but I have not eaten it so I will withhold from commenting.

<Content> Ordered for delivery about 6 months ago. Food came after close to 2 hours. It was cold when it came, and the driver was barely apologetic. They were very unhelpful over the phone. Food was mediocre, definitely not the best I've ever had, but also not the worst. I was apprehensive because there have been claims of cockroaches in the food, but I had none. I would definitely go with Cravings if you're in the area over Bobo China.

<Content> It is the only authenic northen Chinese restaurent in Champaign-Urbana area. You might have realized more Chinese then foreign people will eat in Bo Bo China because Americans like fake Chinese food such as orange chiken or General Tso's Chicken which never appear in China. It is one of the very few Chinese restaurants that offer hot pot (average) in Champaign and the only restaurant offer good home made Chinese buns every Thursday evening (unfortunately you need to call and order around noon because Chinese students on campus are crazy about them).I gave it a 3/5 because I am from southern China so not a big fan for northern food, but objectively the northen food they have is very good. Anther reason is that they don't seen to have enough people working there, so they serve food slower than average Chinese restaurants (but still faster than American ones). And lastly, it's not a fancy restuarant to take your girlfriend on a first date. It's more about a home style one.

<Content> I went to this place with my friend whom I hoped to catch up with. After pointing at every restaurant and choosing one we had both never gone to, we found ourselves at Bo Bo China.I don't know if this is an unwritten rule or custom, but I figured somebody on staff would recognize two people who had no idea what was going on. With little guidance, I pushed us along and we found a seat in back on those sticky, red vinyl benches. We went towards the buffet and got one of each thing. The food was all pretty bland and there was no definitive winner of the choices, or one that was even slightly above average.And then it happened. I glanced down at my foot and saw a cockroach about the size of my pinky crawling around my feet. Suddenly, I had lost my appetite. I didn't have the heart to tell my partner what I had just witnessed since it was my idea to go to this hut in the first place. We just conversed over tea, the one beacon of clouded hope in a desolate, unsanitary wasteland.As we walked out, I flagged down a member of the staff, and she almost seemed surprised when we asked to pay our bill. Is this like a donation-based service? Even, if that was the case, I still wouldn't recommend it.

<Content> As much as I love my Chinese heritage, I will not dishonor it by writing a good review about Bo Bo China.Let me put it this way, I have eaten here about 3 times in the past four years, and after my last time... well it is going to stay the last time.I ordered a spicy chicken with fried rice combo which arrived in a hour to my workplace. Since it was busy i was only able to eat 1/3rd of it. The next day at home I heated up another third of it. And finally on Sunday, I ate the final third.AS I WAS FINISHING THE LAST COUPLE OF BITES:I FOUND A COCKROACH IN IT... AUGHHHHThe cockroach had been cooked with the dish and I guess settled with the sauce to the bottom of the takeout box. I had a moment where I thought I should be vomiting uncontrollably. But thanks to my superb nerves of steel i calmly spit out the food I had been chewing and proceeded to scrub my mouth out. Dry heaves ensued.I am never eating here again. I am one to hate asian stereotypes about subpar kitchen cleanliness but this one takes the cake. Honestly? A cockroach? *Sigh*

<Content> My mom never walked out on a restaurant - until the day we stepped into Bo Bo China.Bo Bo China didn't know what to do with themselves when my family and I said we DIDN'T want to eat their buffet , which was sad looking, and we wanted to order from their regular menu. We were handed some poorly copied paper menus and sat down in the pretty empty restaurant. Apparently there's an unspoken rule here that you either go for the buffet or order takeout, because the lack of service was offensive and we were hungry. The buffet also had flies buzzing about it. Never again will I come here, which isn't a loss since there's another Chinese restaurant next door and one across the street. What is up with this stretch of Green St. in Champaign, IL and their Chinese restaurants?

<Content> I can overlook a slow delivery order that mixed up crab rangoon with egg rolls, but the final straw was getting bubble-less bubble tea. We ordered it and it came out as basically a sugar slurry. I asked the people working there where the bubbles were and they said they didn't have any. Would have been nice to know before I ordered...

<Content> Let me start by saying that, for the first 24 years of my life, I had zero experience with Chinese food. My parents are meat-and-potatoes people, and Chinese carryout was simply not a part of my upbringing. Enter my Chinese-American husband, who grew up on the stuff (naturally) and can cook it like nobody's business. This (lengthy) disclaimer is basically to tell you that I am not an educated critic of Chinese food, so it's based on whether or not I liked it. I have no way to judge how "authentic" someplace is.All that said, Bo Bo is pretty good. It's a campus town take-out type place, although they do have a dining room and a few tables, so you can eat there if you choose. They have a very extensive menu, printed in English, Chinese, and Korean. The menu has every Chinese food item you can think of, and many that you probably can't (and here I am thinking specifically of a dish, whose name I cannot remember at the moment, involving fried pork intestines. I'm told it's good, although my Leviticus 11 Diet prohibits me from partaking). My favorite item here, though, is the bubble tea. I don't know how they do it, but they make the best bubble tea I've had. I've tried replicating it at home, and simply can't do it, so, much to my chagrin, when I get a BTC (bubble tea craving), I hop in the car, drive to campus, finagle a parking spot, feed the meter, go get my bubble tea, and repeat the process. It's a lot of trouble to go to for bubble tea, but it's THAT good.I did take off a star because they don't always have the bubble tea. One (very busy) day last month I was running errands; it was cold, it was rainy, I was tired, and all of a sudden, I was siezed by a powerful BTC. I was sort of near campus anyway, so I drove over there, finagled a parking space, fed the meter, went in, ordered, and was told that they didn't have any bubbles cooked. Unfortunately, I simply didn't have the time that day to wait half an hour for the bubbles to get cooked, so I ordered the tea sans bubbles, which was still pretty good. However, I was annoyed that they charged me the full price. I thought I should have gotten a discount for a bubble-less bubble tea, but I didn't have the time or inclination to press the issue. Hopefully, that was just a one-time occurrence, and I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.

<Content> I've only ordered delivery from here through a 3rd party site so I can't comment on their location but I've liked 6 or 7 different items that I've ordered.Their delivery isn't the fastest but I've ordered during busy times (usually about an hour to get food). Yesterday, my food took over an hour and a half to arrive. The restaurant never brought it up but the 3rd party website emailed me a $5 credit without me complaining or asking for it. Mimimum order requirement for delivery is $8 which is lower than most and delivery costs $2. Beef Curry is great here but that's just based on my taste so who knows if you'll like it or not.

<Content> I got this delivered. It was OK. I'm sure there are better Chinese places in CU.

<Content> It is the only restaurant in the Champaign area that serves authentic northern Chinese food. If you are from northern China, you can't miss it.

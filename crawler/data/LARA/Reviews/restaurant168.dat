<Content> Having been to almost every asian restaurant around champaign-urbana, I must say that bangkok thai is both my favorite and the place i frequent the most. The pho is unbelievable. I go here more than twice a week for lunch. Basically this place is super cheap, has great quality food, is at a convenient location, and your food is always prepared quickly.

<Content> Absolutely love this place and would give 5 stars for the pho. The broth is incredibly tasty and it always comes out tasting amazing. Believe me when I say it warms your soul. However, I'm not really a fan of the Thai food. I had the Pad Ke Mao when it was the daily special and the noodles were mushy and lacked vegetables. But this could have been they were rushing and had pre cooked the noodles because of the high demand for pad ke mao that day? The store owners are incredibly friendly and the food comes out super fast. Definitely   a cheap, delicious, hidden gem on green street and deserves to be checked out!

<Content> Best Thai food in Champaign! It's pretty hidden in regards to street view and I wish I had tried it sooner. Hands down the best Pad Thai I've ever had. Fair warning though, regarding the spice scale they really mean it. Spicy means SPICY! The Pad See Ewe is also really good. This is a great place to go if you're looking for a moderately priced meal and leftovers for later (the portions are HUGE).

<Content> This is definitely the restaurant I want to go to any time of the week. The food is delicious and the service is very fast. Though the Pad Thai is the more popular choice for most people, I recommend the Pad Kee Mao (listed under the Friday special). It uses large rice noodles (about twice the size of Pad See Yu) and has a wider variety of vegetables. It's also much more savory and filling-- I can eat twice as much Pad Thai than Pad Kee Mao and still be more satisfied with the latter.The food can be inconsistent. There are days when I find the Pad Thai too dry or even too saucy. I understand that the cooks make a lot of Pad Thai (especially on Mondays), but I find the Pad Thai inconsistent even on weekends.I recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a quick lunch or looking for a place to sit down and hang out with their friends. The environment is very open and friendly.

<Content> Restaurant review:Eh, maybe I should have went with the curry. I was craving asian food and decided to come here for dinner. This restaurant reminds me of the Hong Kong dai pai dong food stalls where you order and they call your number to pick up your food. My wife had the pad thai which was a good value and tasted like pad thai. I ahd the pho and it was 2 thumbs down. Even though it was the combo pho with everything, there was not a lot of protein items and the noodles were overcooked. The worst thing was the pho broth which is usually a highlight. I don't know what they used to season it but somehow it tasted like dish water. There was no clear broth flavor with star of anise or hint of cinnamon. It just tasted very off and I could not stomach more than a spoon of the soup. If you want cheap food then the lunch special looks like a good deal, but stay away from the pho at all cost!Pro: inexpensive, no tip you bus your own tray, lots of seatingCons: terrible pho soup, not good at allHidden gem:I have not been here for lunch, but for 5 dollars that seems like a steal with good portion sizes per other reviews.

<Content> Oh man, having tried all the specials now, I can see why this place is so popular. For just $5.55 after tax for the lunch special, it is an incredible deal for what you get - very filling and delicious.Monday: Pad Thai - pretty standard, but good.Tuesday: Fried Rice. See my previous review.Wednesday: Basil Chicken - the sauce makes it. Mix it with the rice!Thursday: Yellow Curry. Very oily, probably because I had it very spicy and they added lots of chili oil. Comes with a huge chunk of rice - very filling. The curry itself was okay, frankly, I'm not much of a curry person.Friday: Pad Ke Mao. I got this with beef, and it was great. The noodles were well done, a decent amount of meat and veg, and the sauce is AMAZING. Couldn't get enough.I'd rank these, from most favorite to least favorite: Pad Ke Mao, Basil Chicken, Fried Rice, Pad Thai, Yellow Curry.If you regularly eat spicy food and have a reasonable tolerance, go for spice level 6 - it's just the right amount of kick.I mentioned in my previous review that the to-go containers are lined with foil. Apparently not always, because mine didn't have it today. Even worse, the woman that put my box in the bag did not think that I would actually carry the bag by the handles, because the box would be 90 degrees to the ground when carrying (with the opening facing directly down) - I didn't notice until it was too late, and now my bag is full of the sauce, which is the best part of the dish. :( It was a pain to clean it up and I'm unhappy I didn't get to eat any sauce, and it is why I'm docking one star.With that issue aside, I'm so happy with this place, but at the same time, unhappy, because it took until my senior year to try this place out! I could've been eating this for the last three years, damn!

<Content> I love to come here during dinner. I always end up ordering their special, which is also super cheap. Normally I would expect for this price to get very subpar food portions and quality. However, I was in fact quite wrong. The food tastes amazing and they give you a large portion which often takes me two meals to finish. I highly recommend this place.

<Content> My score is 3/5 for the quality of the food, and an extra star for the price and how fast the food arrives. I work just off campus and come here at least twice a week for the daily $5 lunch specials. This place is very popular among students, so I try to come before 12 or after 1 if possible to avoid the crowds.

<Content> This place is so so. Ordered the Panang curry with shrimp and all that was prepared was tiny shrimps in a bowl of curry with no veggies of any sort and served with a bowl of rice. Come on man??!!! WTH?!? Not even worth it!!! Also ordered the Pad See Ew and that was too salty and not enough noodles or meat. Tried to order a home made or made from scratch Thai iced tea and was referred to a can version of it! No thanks! And why would a Thai restaurant have pho on their menu??!!! Stick to your own cuisine and perfect that! Needless to say, pho isn't all that either. Everything there is over priced for mediocre food. Students beware! They think you don't care or know any better since you're college students! On the bright side, the fried rice was decent.

<Content> Probably the greatest addition to campus in a long time. The other closest Thai food nearby would be Basil Thai, which is on the opposite end of campus. Every day during the week, there will be lunch specials. For a mere $5, you can enjoy food that is enough to be considered as two meals! In addition, you can also adjust the level of spiciness to your liking, on a scale of 1-6 if memory serves me right. Their pho is also fantastic! Very authentic and very large portion. One no longer had to travel to downtown Urbana to Xin Xin Cafe for pho. The staff are all extremely friendly and am not afraid to chat with you despite their slight language barrier. They are always cheerful and if there's something wrong with the order, they immediately replace it without further questions asked. Definitely a place worthy of regular visits!

<Content> Good food and you can't beat the lunch specials! I've come here for the Thursday curry and the Monday pad thai and both were great at only $5! Watch out, this place can get crowded at lunch but don't worry, the line moves quick.Can't wait to try the pho!10/27/14 UPDATEI just got back from eating here for lunch. They've instilled a new policy where if you order the special, its automatically served in takeout containers. For someone who goes out of their way to limit their contribution to landfills, I'm not sure if I'll be coming here often to say the least and I definitely will avoid ordering the daily special.

I've stopped by quite a few times for the daily specials, which is completely worth it - good amount of food for $5-$6. Haven't tried the pho so I can't comment on that.

<Content> Went here for lunch on a weekday. Its a campus location, so expect students, cheap prices and a "hit or a miss" food. We went primarily because my SO was craving for som Pho. Reading Yelp reviews, we walked over to this place. This is in the old Zyygyz location. Cant miss the green awnings.Its a hole in the wall. So dont come expecting a proper sit down place. We proceed to order a Pho and basil chicken. They have daily specials for $5. They have an assortment of condiments and a choice of spice level. Pho was a generous serving. We could not finish ours and it tasted really good.Basil chicken was acceptable. Overall, food was good. There were only a few tables occupied, so the food came out fast. Strongly recommend this place for lunch or a quick bite anytime. No complaints about food.Will return when we crave Thai or Pho.

<Content> My experience here was just okay. I ordered Pho and the broth just didn't cut it for me as being good but it was just alright. My boyfriend ordered the cashew chicken for the first time and he loved it. My friend got chicken fried rice and that was good as well. The price is fairly cheap for the portions at this place which is great for college students. I would come back here for food but not for the pho. I'm only giving three stars because of two reasons. One of them is that I ordered the Thai iced tea for almost $3 and I expecting to have some refreshing authentic Thai iced tea, but instead it was a really small bottled one from the fridge which was pretty disappointing and not worth $3. The woman behind the cashier said "I'm too lazy to make a real one," as her excuse. My second reason is that the restaurant was way too humid and hot with the doors open on a humid rainy day. I was sweating uncomfortably while eating my hot pho and it was unpleasant. There were workers fixing the ceiling tiles or something nearby too, which I thought was unacceptable for when people are eating around them only a few feet away. The food was good, the atmosphere not so much. I will still be coming back for a quick Thai fix because it's so accessible and conveniently located on Green st.

<Content> I am always on the hunt for some good Thai, especially the Pad Thai! In all my travels I don't know if I've stumbled upon such good Pad Thai at such an affordable price. The portions were larger, and the service quick. It wasn't much of a place to go for ambiance, but if you're wanting good Thai, this place is a must!

<Content> My boyfriend and I came here looking for good thai iced teas and good thai food. We got the xe lua pho and it was delicious. It wasn't as authentic as some viet places back in California but it definitely filled the missing void for pho that I had. My boyfriend ordered the pad kee mao. Omg it was phenomenal. Giant chunks of noodle with some veggies. We both thought it was great. The only downsides were the spring rolls had too much lettuce and they didn't have authentic thai iced teas (only ones that came in pre packaged bottles - which still tasted fine but not what we were looking for) All in all, great food. Good find but those disappointments weren't worth taking a star off for. Highly recommend!

<Content> Dirty, overpriced and untasty. My pho tasted like one big bowl of OLD salt water. Very little meat, no thai basil. Honestly, the worse bowl of Pho I've ever tried (couldn't bring myself to do it) to eat. My dinner partners fried rice was oily with no veggies and little meat. Our soft drinks which were listed as "free refills" for $1.75 were given to us in 12oz cans, with no refills available. Our appetizer sampler only contained 1/2 of what it was listed to have. We had chosen to eat there, but all the tables were filthy. Even though there were only two other tables eating at the time we were there no employees choose to take advantage of the lull for some cleaning.. No thank you yelp community. You missed the mark on this one.

<Content> Some of the best pho you can get on campus. Go during lunch time for cheaper prices. Don't forget to look at the special of day for added discounts. Flavor-wise, the broth is pretty authentic. I find their tripe a bit hard and chewy sometimes, but the beef balls and other meat is done really well. So...sounds pretty good, right? Well, everything's great until you see the price tag. In Vietnam, you can buy an amazing, overflowing bowl of pho for, get this, $1. Yep. Here, it verges from $6-9. Given that it's the only place on campus though, I would collect those dollars together, my friends. This place is totally worth that added hole in your wallet, at least once a month.

<Content> Come here for a quickly prepared, delicious meal. I've been here a few times, and I am a fan of their pad see ew, curries, and pho. However, I think that while the pho broth has good flavor, it is also heavily garlicky, so I would recommend adding more sriracha or lime juice to counterbalance the flavor if you're not a big fan of garlic. In general, it's not the best Southeast Asian food I've had (I grew up in New York City), but it holds its own. The cons are that the ambiance is lacking and the thai iced tea comes in a bottle instead of being made from scratch.Daily specials ($4.99 lunch and $5.99 dinner) as of today are:Monday - Pad ThaiTuesday - Fried RiceWednesday - Basil ChickenThursday - Yellow CurryFriday - Pad Ke Mao

<Content> Like other reviewers have mentioned, Bangkok Thai has a 5 dollar lunch special for every weekday with massive two meal servings. However, thats the end of the positive things I have to say about this place. I have noticed that their spice levels are very inconsistent. I have ordered a spicy 6 (the highest level) and received a dish with no spice at all. Additionally, the food is almost always extremely oily.

<Content> Pho Tai :DThe broth: Great, not too sweet or heavily spiced.Meat: They drop it in right at the last minute when packing up your soup to go, so it's fresh. There is a decent portion of it. Definitely way more noodles than meat, but it's ehough to make me happy.The vegetables: sprouts, green onion, lime, and a big portion of noodles. No thai basil included, you can ask them to add some on the side.I recommend taking it to go, coming home, and pouring everything into one of your own big bowls at home for a more cozy feeling than eating in the restaurant which is a little divey (although cute with the turtle tank in the back and the beachy looking awning). I also snuck a little of my brother's pad thai (I'm dieting, ho hum) and it was delicious.

<Content> I have been here several times now and every time it is astronomically delicious! Though, to be 100% honest the only thing I ever get there is Chicken Pad Thai and Crab Rangoon.The store itself is hidden in what seems like an apartment complex right across from a laundry mat.The owner of this location is a nice guy with a open and joking personality. when I first went their and ordered Pad Thai he got this evil/mischievous smirk on his face and asked if I like spicy food. Though I had already been forwarded about their spicy level and stated my preferred starter number which was 3 to vary how spicy I could go and one day when I feel nice a stupid I'll go up to 6 but I am not a young man anymore and I WILL regret that act of bravado. If you love Pad Thai go there on Monday as it is on special for $5.99

<Content> I love this place. Honestly probably go here the most on campus. I can't say anything about it being authentic because it's the only thai place I've been to but I think it's amazing. I love their specials during lunch and dinner. Such a good deal and I like basically all of them. The owners are so nice too. I think my favorite is the yellow curry which is on special on Thursdays. I think the fact that it's always busy shows how much other people like it too. I usually get take out just because but the when I eat there the tables are always clean and I think the rice portion is bigger. This is a put your dish in the bin place but for the cheap price I don't mind. Also love the little turtles in the back! I'm gonna miss this place when I graduate.

<Content> I have been on campus for nearly a year and just discovered this place and am disappointed about that. It would be easy to miss if you walk casually down Green Street between 4th and 5th. I only discovered it thanks to a Yelp search. I had the Pad Thai, which was amazing and relatively cheap. They give you 6 options in regards to heat on your dish (1 being the least and 6 being the hottest). I like hot food, but refrained from going with a 6 (the hottest on the 1-6 scale). I decided to only try a 4. I found the 4 to be good and have a nice subtle heat that blended well with the other flavors. I will probably give a 5 or 6 a try the next time.  The servings are enormous. I am a big guy and half a serving filled me up. Needless to say I have another meal sitting in my refrigerator. As others have said the owner is extremely nice and has a great sense of humor. The decor of the place is lacking, but that is not a factor for me as I only rate a restaurant based on the food. If you want great Pad Thai then this is the place to go. I will be trying some of their other dishes in the future and possibly update this post.

<Content> How did I forget to write a review for this place???It's delicious!It is kind of hidden, and yes, it's a hole in the wall. But in my experience, holes in the walls have the best food!!And this place is no exception. We had the Tom Kha soup and something with chicken (I don't remember what my husband ordered, but it was chicken and it was spicy and it was amazing.) My soup was heavenly. Just what I had a craving for! It had just the right amount of kick.I'd love to try more of their food.Their staff was very nice, and they cooked the food perfectly.Try this place. You won't be disappointed!

<Content> Came here at closing time.The cashier was super friendly, and super nice.We got our food fairly fast i'd say. The owner was nice to let us stay for a while and to also order more!The food was not bad for a small town. Portions were not too big, and price was okay!

<Content> Been here several times, and it's by far the best spot in CU to get Pho. Love the Pho, and the Pad Thai here, and the spring rolls are good too. They have the most awesome daily specials too. The staff is very courteous and friendly. I would recommend this this spot for anyone wanting to try something new, or if you are a California guy like me, that loves the Pho.

<Content> I first went right after it opened a couple of years ago and have frequently returned. You can't go wrong with any of the best noodle dishes, especially the pad Thai on Mondays and pad kee Mao on Fridays when they are on special. The pho is also really good when there aren't any specials I want

<Content> Mia Za's used to be my favourite restaurant on campus until I came here. I wasn't overly chuffed with it replacing Zyggyz, but one visit later I was a frequent customer and a fan. Their pad thai, pad sew, pho and yellow curry is worth going the distance on Green street. Fairly priced too, I am a regular visitor on Monday's for the pad thai and Thursdays for the yellow curry (daily special, around 5-6 bucks). Spicy too! Can get it non spicy, but then where's the fun?! but there is the option.

<Content> I'm not sure if this restaurant is related to the Bangkok Thai in Savoy, but I think this location on Green St. in Campustown is a lot better than the Savoy location. This is located in the little plaza on Green and Fifth.  You place your order at the window and in about 5 minutes, they call out your order and you go pick it up. So there's no waiter service.  I ordered the Pho with rare flank steak and it was the most authentic I've had in the area. Yes, it beats out Xinh Xinh by a LONG SHOT.  I also ordered an egg roll --- it wasn't great but it hits the spot if you need an egg roll fix. It's more like a Chinese egg roll than those fried Vietnamese spring rolls which I was hoping that this was.... but alas.  The soup on the other hand, was delicious. The noodles were the right texture, the beef was tender (although I wish they put more in) and the accompanying bean sprouts, jalapeno, lime made everything taste better!! I love this place and will definitely be back now that I know that there is close-to authentic pho in Champaign now.They do have an extensive Thai menu as well, but I would stick with the Pho. I saw lots of other customers who had various Thai noodle dishes who seemed happy. The only drawback to this place is that it is in Campustown.

<Content> Fantastic Thai food for great prices. Their pad thai is great, and it can feed two for around $8. During the week they offer specials for $5, choice of rice and meat, generous portions. Their crab Rangoon is unique and is pretty good, worth a try. The owner is a very nice guy, provides great service! If you're in the mood for thai on campus, this is the spot to check out first.

<Content> Don't let the building and decor fool you--this place has DELICIOUS and authentic food! My boyfriend & I were searching for a good thai place around campus and finally found it. The man that works there is always so cheerful and friendly. They definitely will make your food spicy if you request it, so if you don't like your food spicy, make sure to tell them a "0" or "1" spicy level. The prices are pretty average for a thai restaurant, but the portions are generous so you can even save it for an extra meal :)

<Content> Been here several times, this place is awesome. You can't beat their prices for the lunch or dinner specials, and the food tastes excellent. I recently find myself getting cravings for this place. I prefer the Pad Kemao(thicker noodles) to the standard Pad Thai, but thats just me.

<Content> Is the food here good for you? No. Obviously.But is the food here *good*? Yessss.Best thing on the menu, for me, is the lemon pepper catfish. Love that stuff. I also dig the Italian beef and the Philly cheesesteak, and the chicken's pretty good too, not to mention the delicious heap of meat that is the gyro burger. They've even got good fries. (Ask 'em to add the lemon pepper seasoning to those, too. So good.)

<Content> This is one of my favorite places in town. The fish and chicken wings are especially good and their fries are a few steps above most. It's not "fast" food, since everything is cooked to order, but if you want fried food that is significantly better than any chain restaurant in the area, this is probably your best bet.I'd generally skip the drive through altogether since it does take a while to prepare everything, but the dining room is a fine place to hang out. It's a little rough around the edges, but I happen to find that sort of thing charming.

<Content> For a charburger place, the food is pretty much lame. The burger did not have any tomatoes on it. The chili cheese fries had some sort of disgusting artificial cheese mixed into it. My digestive tract was quite furious with me for subjecting it to such an egregious punishment.

<Content> Not impressed, had the 2 Chicago dogs, fries and drink special, the fries automatically smelled like fish before I even opened the bag and were otherwise flavorless, the dogs weren't even borderline decent, no freshness in the veggies, the onions were definitely old and dry, pickles mediocre, and the relish wasn't the neon green that is a definitive piece of Chicago dog. The buns were standard, not the poppy seed variety, and there was no celery salt on the dogs. Even the meat was below average, definitely not a place I'm heading back to even if the special was $5.38 with tax.

<Content> Best Italian Beef in town, as far as I'm concerned.Awesome fries - they're those lightly battered crispy fries.Serve yourself soft drink refills (which is always a plus for me in a counter service place).I don't know what Skip B is talking about with regard to being dirty. I found this place exceptionally clean. Even the window sills were free from dust. As for the dining room being empty, they seem to have quite a bit of drive through traffic at lunch time. Besides my husband and myself, there were also four other tables full of guys - mainly construction/manual labor type guys.All in all, it was exactly what I was looking for - a great beef sandwich in CU. YUM!

<Content> I stopped at Windy City Express Sunday for the first time. I asked the person on the other end of the intercom if they served Chicago Dogs, and they replied yes. I was informed that the Chicago Dogs were on special; two Chicago Dogs, Fries and a Drink for $4.99, so I ordered the special. When I arrived home I was very disappointed; what I had was two hot dogs on hot dog buns... Chicago Dogs are Beef Franks (preferably Vienna) on a Poppyseed Bun with green pickle relish, chopped onion, tomato wedges, dill pickles and sports peppers sprinkled with Celery Salt.. Windy City Express had some of the right ingredients, but the wrong Hot Dog and Bun, with no Celery Salt... I guess for those that have never eaten a real Chicago Dog, they figure that anything will do...

<Content> My fellow yelpers writing these review are definitely not eatting at 410N Race st.in Urbana or they own or work for it. This place is real bad, really need big house keeping improvments dinning room is dirty. Still gave it a shot, dying for a Chicago dog. The girl taking my and two other costomers order seemed to really have something better to do then wait on us. This is at 12:30 I should have known something was wrong only me and one other guy in the place at lunch time. Seem to be on a down hill slide here. Chicago dog in Urbana 2 hours+or - from Chicago should not be all that hard, but for this place it is impossible. A Chicago hot dog is 1 all beef dog, 1 poppyseed bun, 1 tablespoon yellow mustard, 1 tablespoon sweet green pickle relish, 1 tablespoon chopped onion, 4 tomato wedges, 1 dill pickle spear, 2 sport peppers, 1 dash celery salt.Thats not that hard. Windy city you get the dollar a pack who knows what kind of meat hot dogs you buy at the discount store, and you get it on the 59 cents a package hot dog buns that you also got well you were there. Then you put a few of the things that should be there on, if you get 3 out of 7 you will be lucky.I did ok I at least got 1 little sport pepper on both dogs. One was good, the dog was only about twice its size, so you don't need a lot of them. Once you put half give or take of the stuff that is on a Chicago hot dog on them, you wrap them up let the bun get soggy, and let it all get really cold. Now brake out the onion rings you got at Save Alot, at least they were hot. This place way bad don't even think about it, the cheap dosn't even come close to making up for the bad. So I am a former North Chicago resident living in Champaign county looking for a good dog that will not make me go to campus town.WOW need more reasons not to eat here go to cu-citizenaccess.org and read the Champaign - Urbana Public Health District report on this place.

<Content> First of all, I never write reviews. For anything. It just never seems worth it. This place is worth it. Sometimes you just want cheap food that you know isn't good for you. My personal choice: a cheeseburger and fries. This place NAILS IT. Crispy, delicious fries. Yes, cheese product cheese when you order cheese fries... BUT HOW ELSE CAN YOU EAT CHEESE FRIES?!?! Juicy, well done, charbroiled delicious MEAT (not "meat") patties. Solid bun, nothing fancy. American Cheese (because that's how I like it, since we ARE in America). And cheap cheap cheap. I would venture to say my favorite no-frills cheeseburger & fries. Really.My boyfriend and I first discovered this GEM when he was getting his undergrad here probably around 2006. We instantly fell in love with their CHEAP & delicious cheeseburgers and cheese fries. They even have a deal on Wednesdays where you can get a cheeseburger, fries and a drink for $3.99 OR a double cheeseburger, fries, and drink for $4.99... CHA CHING! We were sold. When we left Champaign we used this place as our last meal, we love it that much. And any time we had an excuse to visit, this was always our place. UNTIL... they closed the location near Parkland. Driving past it's boarded up windows was devastating. Many nights were filled with tossing and turning over this loss... until two days ago when we found the new location. We just about got into an accident, we're thrilled!! We moved back two weeks ago because now I am going to law school here, and while we are disappointed with the new location we are both excited for the many joyful meals to come.

<Content> Need fat? Need carbs? Come here. I usually get a steak grinder (or sub I guess) and jalapeno poppers. They do the steak just how it is at home (the East Coast). I trust a place full of construction guys on lunch break. They also have good fried fish.

<Content> @ Skip B. I read the inspection report from 1/24/11 and didn't see anything too serious on there.  There were 5 critical items mentioned. One was for no date on portioned salad dressings. I assume "portioned" refers to when you pour dressing from the main container into a secondary container for daily use. The second was for putting fish and fries at convenient locations during lunch rush. The third was something about the ice drain line, fourth was some air gap issue with the drive through window, and the last was for a bag of ice melt being stored on the same shelf as food. When I see a score of 31 I expect there to be spoiled food, dirty/sick employees, rodent infestations and the like. These are hardly reasons for me to stop enjoying my guilty cheap burger and fry pleasure. With the previous rant review addressed this place is the best alternative to fast food burger chains. I have had their burgers, chicken fries, fried okra (!), and fish. Their fish is surprisingly yummy and burgers should be ordered doubled and split with a friend.  My biggest complaint is that they don't have root beer or ginger ale. As a result I never order a drink.

<Content> One of the best "fast" food places this whole area. I say "fast" because most things are cooked to order (like the hot dogs) and take awhile.I haven't had a Chicago Style Hot Dog this good anywhere else outside of Chicago. Although they don't have the poppyseed buns (very odd), they are still quite fantastic. And only two bucks!In general, Windy City is priced competitively. I've had almost everything on their menu once. Everything is priced well and tastes good to great--except, oddly, their hamburgers (by default). The meat is fine but I don't like the way they dress it with only ketchup, mustard, and grilled onions. But I just ask them to put plain (raw) lettuce, onion, tomato with ketchup and mayo on it instead (traditional burger setup) and they are perfectly happy to do so--much better.Side note: Also highly recommend the Veggie Pita. Awesome value for a great tasting non-meat alternative.

<Content> This place is my guilty pleasure. The food is not really healthy but it tastes so good. I try to stay away from this place but I can't. I have probably tried 3/4 of the menu and I haven't had anything I didn't like. Chicken fingers, Italian beef, hamburgers, fish, cheese sticks, shrimp, Philly cheese steak are all great. Mild sauce is just like Chicago. The fries are good too, lightly battered and crispy. Prices are very good. Highly recommended.

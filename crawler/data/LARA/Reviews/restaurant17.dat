<Content> I wish my group of friends would expand and try bars in town other than quality. But, usually this is the place where grad students and young professionals lean towards, so I've been here quite a bit. The beer selection is relatively good, and the service is fine. I like to go earlier in the evening, as it can get really noisy after 10 pm or so.One thing to note it the awfulness of the bathroom scene. As soon as you head down the hallway, it starts to reek--I seriously feel like I'm back in New York, heading down towards the subway. The bathrooms are almost always stinky, so I try to not stay too long so that I can avoid those stalls.

<Content> The Good: The decor is quite nice: exposed brick walls, high ceilings, and wood floors. There is a large selection of board games which seem to be well taken care of and the beers on tap seem to rotate often enough to offer a decent variety to the customers. The outside space is enjoyable during the nighttime and offers a nice vibe with the strung lights in the alley. The Bad: The acoustics in the bar are HORRIBLE. You basically are unable to have a conversation with the person sitting next to you unless you scream. The line at the bar is also extremely chaotic and the bartenders seem to have no system to take care of their clients in an orderly fashion (I realize that's a common problem in bars but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be mentioned). Finally, I ordered a Glenfiddich neat and I got a full glass of ice and scotch. I realize that people go there mainly for beer but ordering a scotch without ice and receiving it with as much ice as if it were a rum and coke is not acceptable.Verdict: I like the bar. It's clean, well taken care of, and the employees and patrons are often friendly and interesting. I just hope that they can solve the noise issue and can create a more effective system for taking drink orders.

<Content> Waited to get service for like 10 minutes. There were five bartenders and they kept skipping us. My guess? The bartenders are color-blind.

<Content> Huge addition to the craft beer scene in downtown Champaign, Quality carries a tap list that rivals the Blind Pig including breweries like Left Hand, Stone, Rogue, Bells, Victory, Founders, North Coast, etc.Bartenders are accessible and friendly and ready to talk about the beer or grab you a sample. Atmosphere is clean and easy. This place is a best bet to find a good "talking" atmosphere in earlier evenings or even not a bad place to study/work because it's relatively quiet, and doesn't have loud music and has solid wi-fi. Can get more packed after 9pm.Back deck is awesome in warmer weather to meet friends, and their are good group tables inside as well.Wish they had a few more beer specials--it's hard to show up here at $5 and $6 for a beer when Blind Pig Brewery is at $2-$3 some nights. But still hope they stay around.

<Content> Really like this place. Great bartenders serving a pretty awesome selection of craft beers. Board games, darts, arcade games, Jenga! And when it's warm enough the patio has a nice ambience. This place is totally on par with any good bar in Chicagoland, so yay!

<Content> For the last three years that I've lived in Chambana, the storefront on the corner of Neil and University has puzzled me. What was it? Why is it in a perpetual state of construction? Is anything going to open there?Well, finally it's open. Quality is a new bar run by two brothers from Watseka, IL. In a strange coincidence I happened to be good friends with a brother of the two owners back in San Diego, and he told me that the place was opening, so I headed to their soft opening last night.In short--this place has amazing potential. It's got a great lay out, first off, two separate rooms, with large space and funky vibe--one room boasts everything from a vintage Ms. PacMan table/arcade game to a haphazard book collection to a chalk wall and bench overlooking Neil Street; the other room showcases the expansive bar, which is host to an AMAZING selection of great beers on tap. You have beers like Founders available next to great California beers like Stone and Lagunitas; it makes me both homesick and delighted to see what they've got on tap.I'd really heartily recommend going; I think this place is going to be the next spot to watch in town.

<Content> In the interest of full disclosure, the owners are my brothers. However, I am the oldest brother and as such I am well within my rights to put them in a headlock when I want to. Thankfully, they've done good when it comes to Quality, so it hasn't had to come to that. I am also a homebrewer, a beer lover, and privileged to live next to 30th Street in San Diego, the best beer street in the country.I'll tell you right now that Quality's beer lineup is on par with any bar in San Diego. Their 16 taps pour a varied array of great beers from all over the country (including some Stone beers from my neck of the woods). The bottle list is extensive. I was honestly surprised that they offered Hitachino Nest. If anyone is itching for some Japanese rice beer action, Quality has your fix. I was hunting for hops when I attended the opening, so I didn't pay the closest attention to the wine and spirits that were offered, but they have them.The space is huge. There are long tables for your big gang of friends and small intimate spaces for your latest Craigslist Personals hook-up. You can toss darts while tipsy or sit outside with a pint and grade those papers that were supposed to be handed back to the class last week (I'm looking at you, U of I grad students). There's even an old-school video game cocktail table so you can play Mrs. Pac-Man or Dig Dug as god intended, buzzed. Whatever you choose to do, Quality will let you do it with a damn tasty pint in your hand.

<Content> From the very thoughtful and extensive beer list, to great decor, and a staff second-to-none, Quality delivers. This is a place where you can sit at the bar with a friend when it is slow and quietly converse or move to a table with a group when the night gets going. Middle-aged couples on nights out sit next to early twenty-somethings who never went home and mellowed thirty-somethings de-stressing from work. There are darts; there is Pac-Man; there is a library with Nabokov tomes.Simply put: This place is Quality.

<Content> I went here for my last night out before graduating, because I wanted to try the "new" place before I left. I was really impressed with Quality, especially because most places seem to stumble rather hard when they first open.There was a perfectly adequate draft menu, and it seemed to have some more obscure beers that I hadn't seen before (Pig or otherwise). There was nice seating outside, but the interior was rather cavernous, and I expect most people will end up sitting inside anyway. I loved the sort of industrial decoration theme going on, and it definitely stood out in the downtown scene. Only issue with the interior was that the seating seemed awkwardly spread out, and I definitely noticed others having the same issue I did finding a comfortable location. The seating could benefit from being more densely packed, or at least better spaced.What stood out to me the most was the fact that the bartenders were actually rather friendly, and didn't make me feel uncomfortable being there (as some downtown bars tend to do to people closer to 21 than 30). I wasn't particularly hassled, and only got carded once (probably because I had a tab, but still). Yes, that might be a silly thing to dwell on, but I appreciated it nonetheless.

<Content> Even with only one visit under my belt, I can say with confidence that Quality may become one of my permanent hangout spots in downtown Champaign. The atmosphere is sophisticated and elegant without the heart-stopping prices of Boltini, Bacaro, or other downtown bars with similar ambiance. The interior is all dark, expensive-looking wood, modern chic, and a bit of quirk. In the late afternoon, there was quite a lot of natural light coming in, which made the place feel both clean and inspiring. Just beautiful. A friend said she'd feel comfortable studying or reading here in afternoons, and I agree.Since the place is newly-remodeled, it smelled very much like an Ikea, though that will likely pass with time. The acoustics of the room also absorbed noise pretty well, so I didn't have to get in my friend's face and shout in order to have a conversation; I could see myself coming here for a drink on an intimate date. Unfortunately, unlike most bars, there was not a lot of seating provided. I imagine that if this place gets crowded, you will probably just have to stand. Not quite sure why there was so much empty space... Maybe for dancing? (Though I didn't pick up much of that vibe.)I can't complain about the beer selection. There were a number of interesting options on tap, though loyalists of the Blind Pig might not be impressed. A wine menu was also provided, with about 6-8 bottles available. The drink that stands out best in my mind was their cider on tap, which was crisp, refreshing and would be a perfect complement for warm, sunny weather.Our bartender was warm, charming, and made sure we were cared for during our visit. We had taken a booth seat, and fetching more drinks would involve crawling over each other to get out of a tight space. Luckily, business was a bit slow, so the bartender came over to check on us, clean empty glasses, and refill drinks with regularity. Very professional and helpful.Until people become familiar with the layout of the bar, there may also be some trouble in finding it. Quality is listed as a location on Neil Street, but the actual entrance is on Chester Street. In fact, one of the main windows of the bar faces Neil, and I could see curious pedestrians passing by, looking through the window and all over the building for some indication of what was going on. An outdoor sidewalk sign or "Entrance over there" sign might really help to steer traffic in the right direction.

<Content> This is a fairly new beer and cocktail bar that opened up in downtown Champaign. There are several entrances, but none are well marked. Once inside there are two sections. One has an L shaped bar that holds about 20 people. Some darts off to the left, the chalkboard with the tap listings is to the right. A patio area outside. The other section has a library of sorts with some low top tables scattered about. The setup is very cavernous, and probably very loud when full. Though relaxing, and enjoyable on the few slow afternoons I have visited.The service is very good. I visited on a slow Monday afternoon. The bartender was friendly, knowledgeable, and quick. Can't complain about that.A smaller selection of about 15 craft beers that rotates. Several Founders, Breakfast Stout and Dirty Bastard. Goose Island and Anchor. Plenty of good stuff on tap, along with an extensive list of bottles. A very nice selection. They also have plenty of liquor, a nice whiskey selection with some cocktails. I have not tried any of the cocktails, but in the set up and selection this reminds me of Anvil Bar and Refuge in Houston, in a very good way. Overall a very enjoyable time. Another good option in downtown Champaign. The downtown area is becoming quite a beer hub. I was very impressed, and a place I would recommend.

<Content> Ok where shall I start? It's 1135. There is no audible music, absolutely no ambiance, and there is a dog (possibly a puppy) running around. I do like dogs but they are a lot like babies... I cannot think of a situation in which it is proper for them to be in a bar (and this is not the first time I have encountered a dog in here) Also the place just kinda looks unfinished. Maybe it's just not my thing. Pseudo hipster vibe with a good selection of beer. Meh

<Content> Love, love, love Quality, though it took me a bit to come around. They can be really crowded on weekends, to the point where I can get a bit overwhelmed. But that's the only real downside to the place.Drinks are reasonably priced; I can get a glass of nice bourbon (Bulliet) for about $6, and scotch (Macallan 12) for $9. The bartenders are also incredibly nice to the snob in me who insists on ordering martinis during rush periods. The place has a nice spirit selection, though it's not incredibly extensive.The beer list is pretty good. They rotate about 10-12 beers on tap, and the bartenders are always willing to talk about beers and recommend or allow you to sample new stuff. Quality's a great little bar, and also a good spot to sit and grade or read at 4:30 in the afternoon with a light beer. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, and the selection rocks. Just don't go on Friday or Saturday (so I can get a seat).

<Content> Just came into town six months ago and I love this place. Packed on the weekends, lots of people to talk to. During the week, slower, but wonderful environment to have a few great drinks and do some work, play a board game.I love the bartenders--all very nice. Terry makes a great shot, Brian a great cocktail and Luke is adorable. Warning, if you like to yell at sports games on the TV, go to esquire. Quality doesn't have TVs. Second warning, if you only like coors lite or mich ultra, this is not your bar. I don't think they even carry it.

<Content> I went to this bar while visiting family at Christmas time. While there the owner screamed obscenities at a young woman and told her to leave, apparently all because she and her friend were having a disagreement with an off duty bar tender. The owner was also a slob and dressed in sweats and sneakers. Completely unprofessional event to witness, and I would never go to this bar again.

<Content> I *love* Quality. It's my favorite bar in downtown Champaign. I discovered the bar when I first moved to Champaign and wasn't able to get wifi set up at home for the first month of classes. As an MBA student, internet access is a necessity. I hadn't yet discovered Grainger Library, so Quality was the first place that I found that was open until 2am that offered internet access. AND they serve beer. Win.In the (absolutely lovely) bar, there are tables that have outlets nearby, so you can plug in and work to your heart's content. A sad fact for the bar, but nice for me, was that it doesn't get too busy on Sunday-Tuesday nights, so I was able to work without too much distraction. (Relatively. I mean... it's still a bar.)The selection of beers on-tap is great, and the bottle list is impressive. The liquor selection isn't terribly pricey, and the daily specials can be pretty amazing. (Previous to Quality, I won't say the last time I had a Mickeys, but at $1? I've had them there.)The bartenders are awesome, and I love them all. They've always been friendly, knowledgeable, and charming. The patrons are typically a diverse bunch and willing to talk, if you're feeling social. (I've even been there when some guy bought shots for the whole bar. Granted, it was a slow night, but still!) There are board games and books to peruse, should that interest you. I've never played video games or darts there, but they exist.The only drawback I can think of is that they don't serve food. They will, however, encourage you to order food to be delivered - they'll even show you menus for local restaurants that deliver.Long story short? The place is aptly named.

<Content> Good beer, reasonably priced. Well liquor is a tad expensive, I think. The outdoor seating is next to some trash cans, so that kind of sucks but you don't really notice it unless you are right next to them. The inside of the bar is really nice. The people that work there are all very friendly and proud of the bar.

<Content> One of the best fast food experiences I've had. My roommate and I were made a cheesy bites pizza the day after they stopped selling them because the manager realized how devastated we were finding out we were a day too late, and it only took about 15 minutes! Great service.

<Content> Ordered a large Meat Lover's w/ jalapenos and onions. Delivered late (by an extremely apologetic, polite driver), grossly under-cooked and a rude woman on the phone when I called to check on the pizza's status. You'd think I'd learn.

<Content> The box says, "make it great", but the contents were far from it. First of all, I had pretty low expectations coming from a Yum Brands chain (Long John Silver's, A&W, etc.), but man, there were a couple of things that stood out:1.) The buffalo nugget things were dry and no amount of ranch dressing could hide it.2.) The pizza slices were incredibly light, indicating to me that the mass of the pizza was mostly air in the dough and that the dense toppings (sauce, cheese) were lacking.It was funny because my roommates ordered 2 medium pizzas to deal with the stress or whatever that comes at the end of the semester. They both walked away from it feeling unsatisfied at best, grease-poisoned at worst. The upside, it was pretty cheap. If you are looking for quantity, come here.

<Content> I ordered delivery from this restaurant.Food:The food was better than expected. I expected to have chopstix grade food but it was surprisingly edible. The portions were of decent size, and it wasn't excessively greasy. I did feel that the food was on the salty side though. I'd recommend one of the combinations platters, they provide the best value for your money.I'd rate it 3/5 stars, its not gourmet chinese, but it's not garbage either.Delivery:I have never had to deal with such an incompetent delivery driver. The delivery driver got to my apartment over an hour after grubhub's expected delivery time. The driver was so bad at his job that I had to give him turn by turn directions for getting to my apartment, and my apartment is located by the intersection of some well known campustown streets. The delivery service was absolutely terrible, I'd rate it as a 0/5.

<Content> I ordered delivery from here last night. It took nearly 90 minutes and they forgot one of the items I ordered. They did deliver the vegetable dumplings, which were soggy and coming apart. They delivered the hot and sour soup that was so over salted as to be inedible, I had to dump it out after a couple bites. They did deliver the Szechuan chicken with white rice, but the rice was significantly over cooked and the chicken was at best mediocre. Needless to say, my first experience with Auntie Lee will be my last.

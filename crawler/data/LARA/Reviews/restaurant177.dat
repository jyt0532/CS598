<Content> I've been here twice now, both times on Wednesdays for lunch.The first time I went, I got the beef nachos. Yes. Yes. Yes. For six bucks, you get a mountain of nachos. If you're trying to really fill up, this is a place to get "the bang for your buck." In addition, the nachos were tasty. While they weren't the greatest nachos I've ever had, I'd certainly put them above mediocre.Yesterday, I did half a sandwich and a soup. I chose turkey and swiss on challah and red pepper & gouda soup. The sandwich wasn't that much to write home about (though I was happy to see challah, even if the student working behind the counter didn't know how to pronounce it...) but that soup was fantastic. Seriously, I would eat that stuff by the gallon - so savory and creamy with little cheese chunks hanging out in there. OH MY GOD YES.In short, I'll probably be back. It's kind of a wheelhouse restaurant but I think they do a good job at it.

<Content> I used to work here in college (along with the Interlude bar and Catering dept). Good times were had here behind the register :) We always made coffee fresh each shift. Coffee and soda are cheap. Best bet for a good meal is to get a sandwich, we made those fresh to order (dinners are just microwaved). In the daytime there's an assortment of baked goods, at night it's just cakes & pies. If it's going to be a busy night and you want food, make sure to go early to get a table and get your food in time, as there will be a long line.Tip - if you want something to eat during intermission, place your orders ahead of time, and it will be waiting for you at a reserved table when you get out. Only desserts and drinks are available after the show ends.There's a parking lot underneath that used to be free, and street parking in the neighborhood is usually easy.

<Content> This place is pretty inconsistent. Some meals are good, but others.. I'll get to that. In general, most of the more complicated items on the menu are frozen and microwaved when you order.Their breakfast offerings are not bad. The breakfast burrito and breakfast pizza are both pretty cheap and reasonably filling. In fairness, I have heard their grilled cheese and soup on Thursdays is good. (I haven't had it myself.)The lunch dishes are not as good; the options change each day. The ones that are good are .. okay, and not that pricey for near campus. The ones that are bad are pretty bad.The nachos are alright - canned pickled jalepenos, diced up tomatoes, olives, thick tortilla chips, gloppy cheese. There is a lot of it. Not bad if you have a craving, but there are better options elsewhere.The salsa and hummus plate's not bad for a snack. Of what I have had here, I would recommend it most.The hamburgers are gross. They taste like school cafeteria low-grade meat and have the texture of frozen sausage patties. My girlfriend's cheeseburger had a big piece of scorched .. something on top of the cheese. Mmm. The "albacore tuna with mango" sandwich is alright, but the mango is mixed in with the canned tuna, along with a lot of mayonnaise and relish. There is not much mango to be found either. (I've noticed charred bits on the breakfast sandwiches too, which is baffling considering I think they are just microwaved.)For sides: the low-fat cottage cheese just tasted off. I have eaten a lot of cottage cheese and never had it taste like that - kinda chalky, kinda sour. My girlfriend got the pasta salad, which was a little better, but swimming in vinegar with some pepperoni plopped down into it. Our iced tea was very opaque and did not taste very fresh. They charge for refills on soft drinks, too.Service was alright, the kitchen guy is cheerful, but the food was unpleasant enough at my last lunch that I'm not going back. Within the same walking distance I can get to Derald's lunch truck and Espresso Royale - and I've been much happier with the food at both. Or Red Herring, or Bevier.It is worth noting that I paid with gift certificates - none of my own money - and still felt disappointed at the cost of free.Can't comment on the baked goods, haven't had them. What I hear is that the stuff made in house isn't great, but they get the cookies from elsewhere and they're okay.Also, after hearing - from one of the staff - that they don't change out the coffee every day in the pots, I am knocking it down to one star. Just, don't go here except maybe for the nachos.

<Content> I've read the other reviews for this place, but cannot imagine why our experience was so different from what others have described. I think I'd rather eat junk from a vending machine next time.We had a BLT. I've never before had a BLT that used diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce. At least nothing about the sandwich was actually horrible, but when talking about a sandwich that should be as simple to do well as a BLT being mediocre and the best part of a meal....We also had the Chili, served in a bread bowl. It was thick and gummy, reminding me of Hormel's canned product. blech.For sides, we had the "Three Bean Salad". I don't think I've ever had a three bean salad that featured bits of broccoli or some kind of mysterious yellow disk vegetable. Other than mysterious extra ingredients, I do not recall it being particularly horrid, but it certainly was not something I'd order again. We also had the Potato Salad, which was decent but kinda sweet.The Iced Tea a fright, with a very industrial taste.Vying for best part of the meal with the mediocre BLT were the Oyster Crackers that came with the Chili. They were made by Nabisco, not my favorite brand, but they were fresh.

<Content> This place is the dietary downfall of many students and Champaign-Urbana residents. I never had enough time during intermissions to properly savor the cakes, eclairs, pies and coffees, so we would sometimes go even if we weren't attending a performance. I don't think it's even freshly made, but the endless dessert possibilities will impress.

<Content> The food here is only okay, but there is something utterly perfect about a campus lunchtime meal at the Intermezzo. If you're a veggie, go for the nachos and/or veggie burger. I also recommend you appreciate along with me the gruff style of the cashier. Untouchable.

<Content> This is my new favorite place for lunch in C-U. Good selection of sandwiches/salads/soups, reasonable prices, plenty of tables, and a nice atmosphere. It feels more grown up than most of your other lunch options, but the food is ready super fast. A number of veggie selections, and the desserts look amazing.

<Content> if you're near goodwin, need to refuel, don't feel like messing with green street, etc, then this is a good bet for lunch. i usually get the tuna salad sandwich. i give that 3 stars. but what should probably be noted is the 5 star rating on the carnegie cheesecake. the crust is really more of a sable cookie and the creaminess of the cake is unparalleled. it's total museum food with a nice vibe from the crowd. if you sit along the north bank of windows which appear to be 50 feet high, you can almost forget you are surrounded by cornfields. good place for meetings too cuz there are tons of tables. dinner before a performance is plausible as well if you are under time constraints.

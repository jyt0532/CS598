<Content> 4.5 stars. Some of these negative reviews are totally out of left field. This might be the *best* non-chain fast food currently in town.This is a great taco joint, the kind of taqueria someone visits who knows what tacos are supposed to taste like. The place is immaculately clean, service is fast, and they follow all of the most important rules:Tacos have onion and cilantro and two tortillas. Chorizo is well seared and a little crispy. Beef tacos, while not so traditional, have an amazing tomato base that makes this place Taco Tuesday destination dining. Mexican coke. Three salsas of varying heat, all delicious. I agree that the steak tacos are a little firm, chicken is OK. They have all the other stuff like burritos and quesadillas too, but this is fundamentally a great taco joint.Really, for these prices, quality, a parking lot, and proximity to campus (about 3.5 miles) this is future destination dining for the University of Illinois students after a few drinks. There's nothing this good by campus, and in a bad food town such as C/U this place deserves a lot of attention.

<Content> This was a surprise. A taqueria with the look and feel of a McDonald's. The place is very clean and service quick. The menus are in both English and Spanish, so no worries there, but some of the signs about specials were in Spanish only. We arrived just before noon and there was a very short line. I ordered three tacos de lengua for 5.50, but they can be had for .99 each when they have specials. They were prepared quickly and were delicious. The tortillas probably were not made there, although I am not sure. They were, however, very fresh and soft. There was ample chopped tongue topped with onions and cilantro. The tongue was delicious and they do not skimp on the quantity. Other meat choices included chorizo, ground beef, chicken, pork, steak, pastor, and fish (for ten cents more). No complimentary chips and salsa (but you can order them). Of course, it's competing with Taco Bell, not sit down Mexican. Our food came on real plates and they have real silverware (as well as plastic, if you want it to go). That alone puts them above their fast food competition. My companion tried the grilled steak and veggies. It was served steaming hot with beans, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole, and tortillas. Almost a fajita dinner, it was way too much to eat! Everything was delicious, however. The steak was nicely seasoned and still tender, and sliced into thin strips. The veggies, heavy on the onions and peppers but included some squash and other things, also were nicely seasoned. She took some home, but said that everything was good. We'd definitely go back.By about ten after 12 the place was packed and the line stretched to the door. It appeared to move quickly, however, excepting for one person who appeared to need a lot of guidance about what to order. Several flat screen TVs were showing Mexican soap operas when we visit, but it appears they also show a lot of soccer judging from comments we heard.Super Taco does have a bit of an identity complex. It looks and feels like a fast food place. But the menu also includes dinner items costing as much as $12 and would appear to come on several plates. Plus, their location, across from Menards in the North Prospect area doesn't seem to make them a casual stop; I probably will visit (maybe often) when I am in that area, but I rarely go to that area. The food is very good, quite comparable to El Charro (in town). In fact, I think that El Charro and Super Taco are the only places around always having de lengua, cabeza, tripas available as tacos, burritos, etc. Maybe Maize does too, but I don't recall for certain.In any event, despite the odd location this place does a lot of business and serves very tasty food. The specials are extremely reasonable, but nothing here is really very expensive, especially given the quality and quantity of food they served us.They have several hot sauces to choose from, but they are not on the table and don't appear to be advertised, but ask for hot, medium, chipotle, or verde at the counter and they will give you a bottle for your table. I'll also add that as they get crowded they get noisier, and you will have to listen for your number to be called. No big deal if you are prepared for it.

<Content> In the past year I've eaten here twice. The first time I went I expected to pay one dollar per taco. However you have to buy a three dollar soda. Maybe I'm slow learning. However I came back after a year because they still have a sign outside that says $1.20 per taco. I forgot to buy a drink again. Six tocos cost me $12 Without a drink. Two nights ago I was at dos reales and had a full plate of food and one HUGE Amber beer with lime and a bowl of cheese dip for $16. And free chips. Sorry but I know why all the tables are empty at Super Tiny Taco..

<Content> With their menu saying tacos, the way you would get them in Mexico, I would expect their other food to be more authentic. I ordered the chorizo quesadilla and a tamale. The quesadilla was made with American cheese and had a slice melted on top even.... yuck. It was just cheese and chorizo, I am used there being crema, quest fresco, and sometimes some veggies as well when getting a real authentic quesadilla. The tamale wad ok. The chicken was a bit dry, and the sauce it was in had no flavor. The tamale itself was a but large and the corn part in some spots was a bit thick.

<Content> I had the carne asada tacos. The tacos themselves were pretty standard. The variety of sauces makes every bite a new experience if you try them all. The rice and beans were disappointing and dry. My friend had the toastada and baby burrito combo and enjoyed it. This place is relatively cheap, clean and decent food.

<Content> Food is OK. They lure customers in with promises of deals and coupons and then refuse to honor them. Then they give you a guilt trip for paying with a credit card. Also they are always out of forks.

<Content> They just refused my unexpired CI Saves coupon because "we decided we don't want to honor those". I will not eat here again.

<Content> The store is clean and big enough to dine in. Foods are cheap. I think anybody can be full for no more than $10. I don't eat Mexican food very much so can't judge the flavor. I like it anyway.

<Content> Simple, healthy and delicious food right in the center of campus at Hillel! I've gone several times and always enjoyed myself, so you should too!

<Content> I've gone to Cafe Sababa a few times already, and I'm always impressed with the care Aaron and Matt put into every order. This is anything but an anonymous place, and the staff is always willing to cater to special requests, talk about new menu items, or just hang out. My personal favorite items are the falafel sandwich (which they made with fries inside especially for me!), the pizza, and the fries.

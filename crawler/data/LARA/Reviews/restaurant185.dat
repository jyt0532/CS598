<Content> I don't think I'll be going back to Espresso Royale soon.Sometime in November this coffee truck started appearing on Matthews Ave. Curious, I checked it out. Prices seemed reasonable, and I had just been lamenting the lack of good small coffee places in town. The Candide coffee truck has been a pleasant surprise.I've been a few times now. When they first opened, they had cheap lattes and free samples as a promotion. The latte was very good - I could taste the milk and it was nice and frothy. The mocha sample was pretty good, but mochas are a little sweet for me. The energy drink had a nice citrus flavor.Since then, I have also tried their regular coffee and some of the pastries. The regular coffee today was an Ethiopian single-origin. More importantly, I took a sip - and really liked it! It had a nutty flavor and tasted good, which was a great surprise. (While I like coffee, I am more used to guzzling down machine coffee or burnt-tasting coffee just for the necessary caffeine.) I actually enjoyed the flavor of this one and the price wasn't bad - about $2 for a small. I got a pumpkin chocolate muffin as well, which was tasty and went well with the coffee. One of the people I work with got a peppermint mocha here and it comes with bits of peppermint candy sprinkled on top. Nice touch.I've seen sandwiches offered from Cheese and Crackers there as well - haven't ordered them at the truck, but I know those sandwiches are good and will check it out next time I forget my lunch.The service is really good - the guy serving is friendly. They take credit cards, too, which is nice for a food truck.So in conclusion: check it out. I'll be going back.

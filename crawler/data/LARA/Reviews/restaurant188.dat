<Content> Folks, this is your quintessential small town concert venue. Great prices, great service, great music. I came from way out of town for an act that I couldn't pass up: the Corb Lund Band. Canadian Honky-Tonk at its finest! What I like most was the vibes - this place has character. You can tell the building is old, but from what it looks like, it is in great condition. The mood lighting is red and dim and the decor has a 60s retro-modern twist. I like it. If it's open, try to grab a seat on the upstairs balcony, especially if seats are limited down below. The view and sound is fantastic.Ticket prices are right on the mark - most shows that I saw are under $20, most well below that. Corb was $15, and from the performance we got, I'd say it was well worth it. What also blew me away was the drink prices, I got an above rail whiskey mixer for under $5. Maybe I'm not used to small town prices, but this was an unexpected surprise.All towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like The Highdive. I have to agree with Jess S. on her review; there are not many places like this in the Midwest, and surely not in Indy. Keep booking the gigs, Highdive, I'll keep ordering Wild Turkey and Ginger Ales.

<Content> My and my main yelper came from Indianapolis to watch Corb Lund play at The Highdive. It's an intimate concert venue/bar, and we had a great time. Parking was a breeze, we found plenty of spaces on a Saturday night right in front of the venue.If you're coming to a show, get there early to snag seating. We found great seats up in balcony, which had it's own bar. Were the bar stools and benches comfortable? Hell no. Not at all, but the awesome drink prices made up for the sore buns. Maybe it's because I'm used to paying upwards of $8 for a mixed drink, but $4.50 Wild Turkey mixers made for a great night! Service was quick, and I never had to wait around at the bar to get a drink which was nice.All in all, a great place to grab a cheap drink and listen to some live music.

<Content> I've never been here for a show...well, let me clarify.I used to come here tons as an undergrad for various Asian parties, and I still come here most times I've visited as an undergrad. Things usually devolve into a shit show.Which, honestly, is a good thing, and it's what I'm shooting for when I want to forget about the real world for a weekend. Sure, it's off campus, but it does have a giant dance floor/stage and some awesome people behind the bar. Last time I was here I just kept asking for either A) something awesome or B) something alcoholic. Never was disappointed once.If anyone you know is planning a party at the HD, be sure to clear your schedule and hit it up. You won't regret it (and you might not remember it).

<Content> My favorite venue in CU.Affordable tickets.Excellent sound.Easy access to drinking with the bar wrapped around the "center" wall. And cheap drinks.Having been to venues all over the Midwest, I always find myself wanting to be at the Highdive for a show. Especially considering a show or tour that would sell-out in Chicago might just reach capacity down in Champaign.How I miss it.

<Content> This place is decent. It's not the best venue I've been to, but I enjoyed myself.The bands playing were great, but I'm not here to review Elsinore (which is getting a bit old to hear about), I'm here to review the venue. The layout is very strange. It seems like an old restaurant with a stage in it. I did like that the bar was very close to the stage and didn't hinder my enjoyment of the show.The drinks on hand were pretty cool. Dundee Honey Brown was on tap, PBR was $2 a bottle and tickets, tickets were $10 and parking at the garage down the street was about $10. Ended up being a $40 per person night when I went, but it was well worth it.Is it like going to the Metro in Chicago? Not at all , but it's also about half the price of a night out in the city. Is it like going to the Orpheum in Madison? Much better, actually. It's a very tolerable and enjoyable venue. I'd easily recomend this for anyone in Central Illinois to check out.

<Content> yay! i am a fan!i have been to music venues all over the world (small and large), and i was pleasantly surprised with the highdive! the staff is friendly, the sound is good, and the drinks are cheap. though they do not serve food, they allow you to bring food in from the pizza place next door. and whereas some venues have so many rules and the staff acts like fascist dictators, the staff at the high dive is incredibly chill.my one complaint is the parking situation. it's hard not to get a parking ticket here as the meters go until 9pm (ridiculous for a town of this size. sorry...), and the highdive does not have its own lot. there are no un-metered spots for miles. the public transportation in champaign is not world class (and i really didn't want to find far away parking and hop on a bus after the long drive to get here), so that's not really an option. i don't think this is the venue's fault, but i do wish they had more ample parking.

<Content> It's been years...but I loved going to shows here while I attended ISU. Very intimate venue to see your fave bands play with good food and libations.

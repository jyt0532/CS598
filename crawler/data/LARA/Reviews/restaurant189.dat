<Content> I think their wings are AWESOME. Much better than BW3 and I actually like that place a lot as well. I'm shocked this place doesn't have a five star rating as their service has always been on point, consistent, and their staff consists of the friendly-tattoo-guy types which is great IMHO. I usually order for takeout but the restaurant seems clean and with a good atmosphere.

<Content> Sure, the staff are kind of disappointing, but the wings are tasty; I usually prefer them for take-out over BWW, especially their atomic wings. I can't speak to the non-chicken parts of the menu--I've only ordered sides once with low expectations, so I honestly don't remember if I was satisfied or not.Overall, call ahead and get take-away for some of the cheapest, tastiest wings at home. No, it won't revolutionize your chicken wing world, but it's good enough to make a regular appearance at movie night.

<Content> Rude employees, high prices, soggy fries, slow service. I was double-charged for an order once and it took 7 days (and several trips back) to finally get my money back. They acted like it was my fault it happened. I also placed an order online, and when I went to pick it up the order slip was still sitting on the printer, and I had to wait 25 additional minutes for them to make the order. No apologies, no compensation for the inconvenience. Just bad service. I won't be returning.

<Content> Yuck!This place is GARBAGE.You would think that with all the NEGATIVE reviews I would listen.But nope, I was too hungry to care.I regret every dollar spent on this place.I ordered 15 boneless wings, 10 BBQ and 5 with Honey Sauce.It was dry, dehydrated pieces of turds with a lackluster sauce thrown over the wings in a cheap attempt to masquerade the low quality of the wings.The fries that I ordered along side the "wings" were standard at best.The only plus side to the fries was the seasoning, which consists of sugar instead of pure salt.But I could of saved the $15 dollars and just swallowed tablespoons of sugar instead.0/10 Would not Bang.Avoid this place.You've been warned.

<Content> This place was aggressively disappointing.The french fries are sprinkled with table sugar. So nasty.The wings are tiny.The Original Hot flavor could be sold to Gerber for consumption by infants. Tastes good, but absolutely mild.The Atomic flavor has the opposite problem - spicy, but doesn't taste good. And unlike a buffalo chicken wing, the Atomic sauce is the consistency of tomato paste. This is not a buffalo wing.The carry-out packaging is nice, but the fries were thrown in there loose. And all the food I received was just above room temperature. Bad form.One and done on this joint.

<Content> My favorite wing place finally came back to CU! I got hooked on these guys when they were in urbana, when they left i had to go to Decatur for these wings, now i'm very pleased to see they are back.the Original Hot, Cajun, and Garlic Parm wings are all excellent. the Fresh cut seasoned fries are simply excellent.This place is a very welcome addition to the CU culinary cuisine

<Content> Wingstop has always been one of my favorite places for great wings for an even greater price!This Wingstop has been one of the best things to happen to our campus! The original, Cajun and BBQ wings are the best in town. I also love how you can add different rubs to the fries (cajun fries are the way to go)! Aside from the great food, the location is convenient, open late and for those lazy Sunday's I love being able to call for a delivery. They take about 10 minutes to make the wings but the fresh quality taste is worth it. I love the fact that I am paying for good quality, fresh wings that aren't just sitting out under a heat lamp.If you want quality wings, Wingstop is the place to go!

<Content> Wow...week 2 of the NFL season. And Wing Stop feels they need to be rude and confrontational with new customers. I called in a simple 10 wing order. Not knowing the "deals" I asked, was told .50 cents a wing. Placed my order of 10 and went to pick them up. When I was asked to pay $8.72 I questioned the order- I thought it was 50 cents a wing? The lady said- NO! That's for boneless- you wanted regular. There was no questioning her... When I tried to question what she said on the phone and that I was confused- she said- that's NOT what I said...she got very angry, loud and wasn't going to let me speak, talking over me repeatedlyI paid my bill- and left. (paying $9 for 10 wings that I was told were 50 cents a piece) I would like to think that customer service would have A) apologized. B) honored the price that I was told on the phone. C) offered polite conversation. Nope. Oh and the wings were not even worth the fight. They were very small- not much meat...and just ok. (the experience didn't help with the flavor) Go To BWW instead. At least they are not rude.

<Content> We got 20 wings here recently and they were literally the worst wings I have ever had.They were small, soggy, had a gray tint and were generally unappetizing. We're poor students, so I ate them anyways, and thanked my lucky stars when I wasn't up puking all night. That is the best thing I can say- that they didn't give me food poisoning. They were small, like, a bite of chicken on each wing, weren't crispy at all and the flavors were bland and tasted a bit off, like gone bad off. As an employee/business owner, I would have been so embarrassed to sell these things. They were priced the same as Buffalo Wild Wings, whose wings are big and crispy at least. I will never, ever, eat here again and I caution anyone else to avoid them as well. Eating here is a terrible waste of money.

<Content> Finally some decent competition for the mediocre BWW.... I've ordered from Wingstop twice since they opened and have been impressed each time. The wings are a little on the small side (hence the 4 stars rather than 5, but the flavors are GREAT. I haven't tried them all yet, but the Original Hot, Lousiana Rub and Garlic Parmesan are all really tasty. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.

<Content> Do not order online if you do not wish to be charged twice. I used to go to wingstop when I lived in Peoria and always enjoyed the wings. The wings in Champaign were good and I was not really disappointed in the quality of the wings. The employees there are the reason why I will not go back. I ordered online, and when I went to pickup the wings I was asked for my charge card again. They say they do this when you order online. I attempted to use a coupon and they just took it, did not give me my free fries. Fed up I just left the store. I ordered 24 wings and a large fry. 12 of one flavor and two orders of 6. I received the 12 of one flavor then 7 of another and 5 of the last. Then the next day I realized that I was charged twice on my credit card. If you walk in and order maybe your experience will be better.

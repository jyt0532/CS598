<Content> I indulge in their lunch special a few times a month. It's a 5 dollar 2 slice deal with a 20 oz beverage. I give them four stars because their pepperoni pizza is some of the best pan pizza around. I've tried the Hawaiian and the combination pizzas as well, but they don't hold a candle to their pepperoni. I always do carry out and they've been prompt with the goods. Once it took over ten minutes, but most of the time I get a pizza and drink within five minutes of walking in.

<Content> My first pizza night in college and Jet's was one of two places reccomended by my roomate, the other being Papa Del's for deep dish. We went with the former, as deep dish for me is a once-in-a-blue-moon occasion. We picked up a large thick crust pepperoni and a thin crust of cheese. Both pizzas were lacking sauce, and in my opinon were just OK. I would not order the thin crust again, it was far too thin and had hardly any sauce on it, meh....The thick crust has potential, though. Nice almost fluffy consistency and good flavor, but you can still kind of tell that it was cheap pizza, almost along the lines of Pizza Hut/Domino's, which I actually do enjoy once in a while.It's hard to please hardcore pizza traditionalists from Chicago who frequent Aurelio's, Palermo's, etc. However, for the price of Jet's you really can't beat it and I'm sure I'll be ordering again next time I need some budget pizza.

<Content> Their pizza is pretty good - the 8 corner pizza is a great value and it tastes very good, and the prices are decent.Their delivery times are really off however. The last two times we ordered through their web site, the pizza was 1 hour and 45 minutes past the promised delivery times, respectively, which were already 45 minutes to begin with. This is too long to wait, especially when delivery is not free ($2 charge). My advise is to pick up from the store, or order someplace else if you want to eat at a reasonable time.

<Content> iv eaten here couple times, i'd say they serve average pizza, i agree on the greasiness, sometime they put too much sauce so the pizza get too saggy. I always place my order online, its pretty convenience. Their monthly deal is also worth a try. personally, i like their bread sticks, they are so cheesy! :)  so overall, not a bad pizza joint.

<Content> I think I am addicted to Jets Pizza after finally trying some Super Special slices yesterday (pepperoni, canadian bacon, green peppers, onions).Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a greasy experience. Instead, the deep dish dough reminded me a little bit of Lou Malnati's because the crust tasted like it had a hint of white wine. I also like good pizza crust and thus was not disappointed with my Jets slices.Parking available, delivery available, not a sit down restaurant. Check your mailbox for coupons. Also, the lunch special is a good deal with 2 slices of either cheese, sausage, pepperoni, or the special of the day and a 20 ounce bottled drink for $5 with tax.

<Content> I stopped in to try the lunch slice special. It was as it is advertised. 2 slices of either pepperoni, sausage or cheese and a bottled drink for an even $5. I chose a slice of pepperoni & sausage. I am very picky when it comes to sausage on a pizza and this sausage was very good too me. The pizza didn't remind me of Garcia's. The two crusts and flavors are very different. I really don't like Garcia's sausage at all. I always pick if off.The pizza left my hands and face feeling very greasy and that totally grossed me out!!They have no napkins so make sure you are prepared for that. I would like to note that someone in our office ordered the Hawaiian pizza for delivery and I tried a slice of it and I thought it was really tasty but then again the grease is what mainly gets me down. I would like to try the thin crust so I might change the star rating if I think it improves.

<Content> Jet's is still pretty new to Champaign and I usually wait a month or two for the restaurant to get the kinks out. I'm glad that I didn't wait though!We ordered on a Saturday night. They said the it'd take about 30 minutes. I thought that was pretty reasonable on a Saturday. They showed up on time, too! Friendly delivery guy!When I called in my order, the young girl on the phone seemed a bit confused, but I know that everyone is new and still learning. Despite a bit of confusion she was polite and my pizza still showed up on time, hot, and the order was correct. We got a hand-tossed pizza and had a coupon for a free, small deep dish. I LOVED the hand-tossed crust. I don't know what it was about it, but it was delicious, flavorful, a bit chewy and crunchy! I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch. The deep dish was good, too. It's not like a Chicago deep dish, it's not as thick but still good! I preferred the hand-tossed crust but my husband liked the deep dish. The sauce was really awesome. It had a real fresh tomato flavor. The spices were spot on. They were real generous with the toppings. Plenty of sausage, onions and pepperoni.I was really happy with our pizza and we will be ordering again!

<Content> Gave this place a shot and wasn't that impressed. First the website for online ordering is very confusing and it ended up not sending the correct order to Jets, which the cashier even admitted is very faulty. She told me next time to call to make sure the order is right. Well, kind of defeats the purpose of online ordering. When we got there the "20 minute" approx time the website gave us wasn't even close. We got there about 40 min later and still waited a solid 15 minutes. I get that they are new, but the website wasn't even close to approximating the time. There was a group of people waiting that obviously ordered online and were waiting around a LONG time. Finally we got the deep dish pizza, and it reminded me a lot of pizza hut, but extremely greasy. I'm not one to complain about the healthiness of pizza, but it left a weird grease film all over my mounth and fingers when I was done. It's not bad pizza, its just not anything I'd go back for considering the price. If this was 5.00 little ceasers then I would expect the greasiness.

<Content> First off, let me just say that this place is a solid pizza joint. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Deep Dish Pizza with a Cajun Crust. It was pretty solid, although not like traditional Chicago style deep dish (think more of a thick crust that's a little softer).Pros of this place:-You can pick like 8 different styles of crust for FREE-They have 3 different styles of pizza (Thin crust, Thicker crust, Deep Dish)-They have a great selection of types of pizza-Wasn't overly priceyCons of this place:-Can't eat inside (only takeout/delivery)-Pizza was good, but had kind of a "fast food" feel-Small pizza was an in between size (more than enough for one person, but not enough for 2 ...)Overall, I gave this place 3 stars because it was a solid choice. I will go back. However, if I'm really in the mood for a pizza-ish meal that's BBQ Chicken, I'll just go to DP Dough. It's a little cheaper and closer. But, I will order from a group from this place.

<Content> I feel like they definitely more so deserve a 3.5 star rating, but since I am not allowed to do so, the "A-OK" of the 3 star rating definitely matches my feelings more. I tried a hand tossed pizza with the signature turbo crust, . The online ordering was definitely nice, and pickup was on time. No waiting. The prices are fair, and the food a good serving size. OK. all check.The pizza itself was just OK on the whole. The sauce was actually amazing, so huge kudos for the sauce, but the rest was lacking. The cheese was on the blander side, and mostly added texture. The crust was also average, and on the chewy side. There is however a baking option for "well-done", so I might get that in the future over "regular". The Turbo crust (the garlic, butter, and romano crust) was not anything special, and pales in comparison to Domino's pizza crust. All and all, I'm not blown away, and I have had better pizza in the area, but I would go again. The sauce was definitely the high point and delicious, and I have to say the deliboats look good too and I would love to try one of them. Definitely a good little pizza place, but not the best. You won't be upset though!P.S. I also found out that there is no eat-in here, it's all pickup and delivery. Just FYI.

<Content> As another review said, this place really deserves more of a 3.5 than a 3, but that's the only option. On a late night, I decided to take the deal on the ad: 10.99 for 1 large 1 topping pizza and 1 small deep dish pizza for free. I went with pepperoniIt was a fantastic deal really. In 20 minutes, I went out to pick up the pizza and brought it home to try for the first time. The pizza actually tastes pretty fine, but my one gripe is how greasy it is. I guess that's how they achieve the crunchy crust and it does have great texture, but the greasiness can get overwhelming after a few bites. Actually, the oil is itself a flavor of the pizza it seems. The way I figured around it was to put a piece of paper towel on the bottom and let the paper towel soak it up. You have an opportunity to be friendly to the environment by reusing by squeezing out said oil from the paper towels and pan frying other items in your refrigerator. I suggest eggs. For my small pizza, I got anchovies on them. Now I've never tried that before, so here's where I don't know whether it's a matter of custom or Jet's, but I got about one anchovy each slice. I don't know if that's how it's suppose to be, or Jet's might have been a little skimpy on it. All I can say is that I felt like I was just eating cheese pizza and at one point, it turns into an anchovy pizza and vanishes soon after. Despite these things, finished the entire pizza over the course of a few days. Would I go back? I suppose if I have that particular craving for the crust. This is definitely not a place to avoid. It's worth a try. :)

<Content> I'm really loving Jet's pizza right now. The best part? They have slices all the time, which for a singleton like me is perfect! You can get two large squares of their deep dish one topping pizza and a 20 oz soda for $5 bucks even - what a deal! The pizza is very filling and I love the deep dish. Nice flavor to the sauce as it's not overpowering.I'm thrilled to have a new pizza place in town that offers slices and will definitely be back for more!

<Content> happiness: all you need is the 8 corner pizza with the turbo crust. there's almost always a coupon for it on their website, which makes it a ridiculous $12.

<Content> Had two slices on a Saturday night, one sausage and one loaded, total was $4.37 with tax. Greasy, but good taste and crunchy thick crust. Good value, but not the greatest pizza I've ever eaten.

<Content> I've been here about 5 times now for their deep.dish slices, and they're quite delicious. It's only about $2 for a slice, which is a bargain in my mind. I grew up on deep dish Pizza Hut pizza, which is kind of similar to this... But this is so much better! It's a very bready deep dish, but has the appropriate toppings to compensate. The crust is crunchified by a layer of golden-brown cheese, which only adds to deliciousness. Definitely give them a try for their lunch special!

<Content> This isn't the world's greatest pizza but it's what Pizza Hut's pizza used to taste like (back in the 80s) before they started being bad.  It's greasy, buttery, crunchy and tasty! I know that doesn't say much for those who never knew what good Pizza Hut used to taste like but it was very nostalgic to me.  Theyhave hand-tossed, sicilian pan (this is what i had) and deep. They have a lunch special of two slices and a drink for $5.  They have either pepperoni, sausageor cheese....and unfortunately they won't add any extra toppings to it....grrr.....  There's only one bench in there, so there's no dining in... Another grrr..... It wouldn't be my first choice for lunch in that area, but 's a decent alternative if you're craving for a quick, greasy lunch.

<Content> This place is pretty sweet. I have had the deep dish with turbo crust, and I had a steak deli boat. This place will definitely get me fat. The crust is kinda crunchy but not hard, the sauce is good and toppings are great. Not that expensive either, I'm going to work my way around their menu between all the crusts.

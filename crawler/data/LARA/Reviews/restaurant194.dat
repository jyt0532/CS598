<Content> Always pleased with this place...the suggestions of meat to add to the noodle bowls are perfect! it's inexpensive and I'm definitely full by the time I leave. Casual atmosphere, although the customer service at the register could use a little help. Overall, good experience, though.

<Content> The cashier person is so impatient, unfriendly and rude. The pasta itself is not fully cooked (it is still too hard). The taste is standard.

<Content> Noodles & Co is your classic american chain restaurant. The food is very consistently good, but not great. I'd love to give it four stars, but two things irritate me about this place. First, they charge extra for meat. Second, their food is really bland. I understand appealing to the general population, but their food really lacks depth of flavor. One cool thing about this place is they have the Coke Freestyle machine so you can mix almost any fountain drink you fancy.

<Content> iv been to this place many many times (i love noodles!!!!!!! my all time favorite) and i pretty much tried all their noodles dishes. but they give so little food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i normally get take out, and i always order at least 2 large size noodles. maybe its because i have a big appetite or watever, i always left hungry. the bowls are always not even 1 half filled i mean its just noodles! how expensive can they be? just give me more noodles please! their employs are not too excited to work there too, seems lazy somehow... i wish they can improve on their portion and attitude. because i really love to get my noodles fixed.

<Content> Before I ever went in to noodles I was like "oh yeah, I get it, it's a little healthier than like chipotle or antonio's, and it has lots of noodle dishes, sounds like a good idea to me." Then I actually went for lunch one time. There was nothing on the menu that looked at all appealing (too much broccoli in everything; I'm a hater,) so I ordered the mac 'n cheese because it was the least healthy looking option and therefore had the best chance of being tasty. I got it with "steak" which cost like an extra $10 or some shit. It was so expensive! My macaroni and cheese came out, and it was so bland I put sriracha in it. The "steak" was not worth the ridiculous $10, and was barely identifiable as any particular type of meat.It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it has air conditioning and is clean.

<Content> Noodles and Company is clean and has a nice ambiance that is missing from most campus-town restaurants. The menu is wide-ranging, with American, Asian, and Mediterranean selections, and you get chose your protein (or save money and not chose one at all). There are a huge amount of drink options, from wine to organic milk. Another great thing is that they have nice brochures with nutrition info and lots of healthy food options. Unfortunately, I find the food at Noodles to be very inconsistent. Sometimes my field green salad is great, other times it is just a bunch of bland iceberg lettuce. Other selections, even those labeled spicy, are a little on the bland side. Unfortunately it's also quite pricey for campus-town and it's often incredibly crowded during lunch. Another thing that annoys me is the excessive packaging for takeout: fancy bags and containers resembling tupperware are wasteful even if they are labeled "made with a chemical to speed up breakdown."But I still come back. They have food that is reasonably healthy and gives me a good dose of protein. I also like the variety of the menu. I love that I can get potstickers with my tomato soup, so that keeps me coming back.

<Content> Great alternative to regular fast food near U of I campus. Before an Illinois football game, the beer and burger places were overflowing. The fast food chains did not look appealing. But this little spot, with a huge selection, plenty of seating, and fast service, filled the bill perfectly. I can't give it four stars because the food was uneventful. I had the Indonesian peanut saute with grilled chicken. The rice noodles were decent, the sprouts and peanuts were fine, the seasoning was nice and spicy, and it came quick and warm. My wife had the tomato basil bisque off their Mediterranean menu. She said it was like eating spaghetti sauce without the spaghetti. Not a destination, but a good lunch alternative.

<Content> I actually fell in love with this chain when I lived in Minneapolis. Was very happy when they moved to Champaign. Now I can at least get it when I come home. Parking can be difficult since this is located in campustown, more-so when school is session, of course. Frequently there is a line, so you may have to wait. They do move through the ordering line quickly though. They will give you a number and then either bring you your food (if you are staying in) or call you up (if you are doing take-out). i really like that you can pick whatever noodles/soup with whatever meat option you desire. I think there used to be a menu option that I got, but it doesn't exist anymore. The last time I ate there, I got the pad thai- which was terrible. I don't recommend that at all. My parents love the thai curry soup...especially when under-the-weather. The bread is really good. And their rice krispie treats are nice and gooey.

<Content> I thought this was a soup place. I was wrong. There's plenty of other noodle items such as pasta and pad thai. I had myself some beef stroganof. It was pretty good and the large bowl was enough to get me full and take some home for a future meal.

<Content> Of the several times I have eaten at Noodles & Co., the food has been fairly decent, consistently good, but nothing to write home about. I like the variety of choices, but it can get a bit overwhelming, if you keep on wondering to yourself if the particular combination you picked will actually taste good or not. I have stuck with western-style pasta, as opposed to asian noodles (why eat faux noodles at this place when you can walk a block and have real pho noodles?). A regular bowl of noodles, meat, and a side soup will run you $8-10, which isn't enough to fill me up completely, but it is nice to enjoy some well-cooked noodles once in a while. The atmosphere is pretty great, perfect for groups of people and for individuals. It actually feels like a fast-food place disguised as a restaurant. It's very roomy inside, and there are huge windows that let you look out onto the busiest corner of campustown.

<Content> I loved Noodles and Company. I like the concept of everyone ordering their own choice of food with different combinations of meat. Service is fast, they bring food to the table. Place is filled with students (but not loud), but then what do you expect in Urbana with University feeding all businesses in the area.There were 5 in our group and we tried: Penne Rosa, Pesto Cavatappi, Indonesian Peanut Saute, Pasta Fresca with Pork and Whole grain Tuscan Linguine. Except for Penne Rosa, everything was very good.Small bowl is perfect size for one adult. Regular can be shared.Service is fast and food is filling. What more do you want at this price :)

<Content> Noodles and Company is an okay place for lunch, and by okay I mean not that great. It's located on campus, which makes it an easy destination for lunch. They serve Asian-style noodles, Italian pasta, and American pasta (think: macaroni and cheese etc). They also have soups and salads. You get to pick your size (regular or small), and can add ingredients (such as meat) if you like. I tried a couple of the Asian noodle dishes: they were alright but really not too impressive. I wouldn't mind so much if they were a dollar or two cheaper.

<Content> Avoid this place. Food tasted stale. I'm guessing the toppings (chicken, shrimp) are simply defrosted and places on the noodles or rice. Even the veggies tasted watery.

<Content> I have been to Noodles and Company twice - and I have been very disappointed each time! My first try was about 6 months ago. I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken...and it was probably one of the most terrible things I've ever been served. It was absolutely bland and half of the noodles weren't even cooked. I couldn't eat it; I had to just throw it away! I wasn't expecting a great Thai dish, just something edible.  So today I was running errands near Noodles and thought I would give it another try. I ordered the Wisconsin Mac and Cheese, thinking I couldn't possibly go wrong with their "most ordered' dish. Unfortunately, my meal very disappointing again. It was just very plain. Not enough sauce for all the noodles, and the sauce that was in the dish barely had any flavor. Not worth it. I'm not sure if these issues are related to this particular store, to consistency issues, or just to poor recipes. Either way, my two experiences warrant a rating around 1 or 2. I'm going with a 2 since it is a nice-looking place....and they must be doing something right since it's always so crowded! I'm just no longer willing to keep ordering until I finally find something that is ok.

<Content> I've never liked the their concept of fusion cuisine when it first came to Champaign. They tried to introduce noodles from different places but they never tasted authentic. The Indonesian peanut noodle was not appetizing and their pastas were, uhm, never mind. Try it and you'll know.

<Content> At first, I completely ignored Noodles and Company because I used to look at the place and think, "Is it really necessary to have thousands of different noodle dishes?" Then I actually tried the place. I tried a dish from the American side, can't remember which one, but it was sooooo good. I couldn't stop eating it . I can't help but think that it has the most interesting taste. The seasoning kind of reminds me of the seasoning in Ramen noodles. Pretty good overall, but why in the world do they sell wine? Is that not random?

<Content> At first this place looked like another noodle chain. But, I was impressed! It reminded me of crepevine in California but for noodles! Did that even make sense? I liked their trio combo for 7 bucks (soup/salad and pasta with meat)! I had the pesto, but I'm definitely going back to try more things on their menu. They also have passionfruit iced tea that's rumored to be awesome.

<Content> noodles is a chain-type place that specializes in...well, noodles? its a bit overpriced for the portion size but the mac and cheese and the tomato bisque are well worth it! the asian entrees are pretty good faux clones - and the few bites of the italian and american noodle dishes i've had are pretty good too. it's a great place to grab a bite in the campustown area if you want to be sure you'll have a good meal.

<Content> I tried the Pesto Cavatappi with Chicken ($2.35 extra) at Noodles and Company. Recommend it highly -- the curly pasta was well marinated in the pesto sauce, and the chicken was succulent! The menu was well laid out, and the service was prompt! There is three different sections to choose from for the main entrees: American, Italian, and Mediterranean. I very much enjoyed my meal, and look forward to trying some of the their other stuff (salads, etc.).

<Content> I eat at noodles at least 3 times a week! It is a filling inexpensive meal. I order the Penne Rosa with extra sauce. I also substitute the mushrooms for spinach. The spiciness of the food is perfect: great taste, but not too spicy that it overpowers the food. I can never make my penne rosa at home taste this great!I have tried the pad thai and indonesian peanut sautee, but did not like them as much as the penne rosa.

<Content> this place is difficult to correctly categorize because of the various cuisines that are represented on their menu. i always get the tofu pad thai though and find it completely satisfying. the atmosphere is somewhere in between fast food and almost table service...i know that makes no sense. just try it, it's a great location if you are on campus and it's always consistently good. rather cheap too.

<Content> This is your standard Noodles&Co. chain restaurant with nice seating and ambiance. If you've been to one before, then you should know what to expect, it's more or less the same. For those of you who haven't been to one, they offer slightly higher prices than you'd like to pay (but not enough that you'd outright stop going), and a somewhat large variety of noodles, ranging from Oriental to your standard Mac&Cheese options, as well as soups and salads. Most of their more exotic dishes range from okay to the not-so-surprising 'WTH was I thinking when I ordered that' response, but a few are really good and worth coming back for. Personally, I don't eat here unless someone else really wants to go, and then I usually order the Mac&Cheese which is my current favorite there. Plain and simple noodles with a bunch of gooey freshly melted cheese. Yum. One good thing about it is that it is located in the heart of campus, so it's a convenient place to stop in for lunch or some other quick meal. It is surrounded on several sides by completely glass windows, though, so it can be a little strange getting some private time with people from the street looking in at you.

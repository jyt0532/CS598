<Content> My wife and I stopped here on our way back to Chicago. The food was all very good and reasonably priced! Everything tasted freshly prepared and full of flavor. They also have outdoor seating which is a huge plus. I'd highly recommend this place for a casual get-together or a date night.

<Content> The meal started with the coconut crusted shrimp and orange jalapeno dipping sauce. The shrimp was well prepared but the sauce was somewhat bland and oily - very oily. For the entree, I had the chicken mole. The waiter described the mole precisely which was excellent since it was the sole reason for choosing it. However, the sauce was poured over a very small half chicken with skin and bones resulting in little meat and lots of picking through the skin and bones to find said meat. The fresh squeezed limeade could have used more lime juice.The restaurant itself is comfortable and inviting. Service was excellent.

<Content> Consistently, I have always had very good food here. Recently, we ate at the bar. Hopefully, the owner or management will read this... THE LIGHTING IS HORRIBLE!I've been in the hospitality business for over 35 years and I am a major "Foody". Three things that can spoil my dining experience is bad food, bad service, and bad atmosphere/lighting. At Escobar, the food and service is good and the atmosphere in the dining room is decent. But the bar... I couldn't wait to leave. I experienced the very same thing at the sister restaurant Milos where the entire restaurant has horrible lighting. The food and service was wonderful, but because of the atmosphere/lighting, I never wanted to return.

<Content> Seriously, what's so fancy about this place when the food and the atmosphere doesn't reflect anything close to fine-dining. I have eaten million times in fine-dining places from L.A. to Europe and this is DEFINITELY NOT the place to experience delicious fine dining. However the prices and portions does fit to the fine-dining definition unlike the taste, service and atmosphere.

<Content> Good food -- a bit pricey for the portion sizes but all prepared well. Meat dishes like the Hanger Steak Asada and osso bucco contained tasty prepared meat that was very tender to the fork and deliciously prepared vegetables and potato on the side. The seafood dishes like the sauteed shrimp and scallops and seafood paella also contained nice large juicy pieces of seafood, although only a few pieces. The rice on the paella as surprisingly flavorful although a little wet. The crema catalana I tried was also prepared very nicely with a crunchy caramelized sugar top over tasty custard that wasn't too thick and tempered with just the right amount of citrus. Overall, the food texture, temperature, and flavor was great -- however the small portion sizes for the price make me hesitant to award the final star.

<Content> So torn...Food + Dcor = 5Service = 1Attitude = 1Dcor was quaint & created a warm/relaxing atmosphere. Food was delicious & consisted of many local ingredients. Coffee (also local) is memorable. I ordered the Guatemalan Torta: eggs, ham, black bean spread, and Monterey Jack cheese on Cuban Bread $9 and my brother had the Guatemalan breakfast: Two fried eggs with black bean sauce, sour cream, fried plantains and tortillas $9. Portions were large, fresh, and appetizing - the torta bread was soft and chewy = awesome; the other ingredients worked well together (ex. saltiness of the cheese + sweetness of the ham). Bonus: I was able to have half of it as leftover lunch today which tasted just as good and wished I had a cup of their coffee to accompany it. The Guatemalan breakfast is a version of the torta deconstructed and my brother's favorite part was the plantains.Operations/management aspect was a mess & unwelcoming. There was a sign that stated "wait to be seated" but that only works if you actually have someone seating people. After waiting for what seemed like an eternity a server appeared moving at snail pace. Coffee came in a cup the size of an airplane coffee cup because they ran out of regular mugs. No one stopped by after food came to the table to check how our food was or refill coffee. I was finally able to locate a server by the time I was close to being finished for a coffee refill, box, & check. Management was unprepared/understaffed to say the least but the alarming part is that they didn't seem to care or wish to be there themselves and it felt like we were intruding. I'm hoping we were secretly on an episode of Punk'd because that delicious meal took too much effort. Great concept, terrible execution.

<Content> Meun is interesting, food is delicious. All 4 of us very much enjoyed our meals. The only issue we had was service; it seemed like they were understaffed (maybe a few servers called in?) and though our server did ok, it was slower than expected. Bottom line, one of the best restaurants in Champaign and I'm excited to return!

<Content> I really needed to break out and try a new restaurant in Champaign. We are here for football weekends and usually go to the same couple of spots. I was down visiting my daughter and she chose a winner!Escobar's has a very inventive menu with a fusion of many latin tastes with its own Ol added to the mixture. We had the fried calamari for our app, something I would not expect in a Latin restaurant but it was delicious with one heck of a tasty sauce. I had the Cuban sandwich for my main course and it was crunchy with all the distinct flavors you expect in a Cuban sandwich but with their own version of it.My favorite two beverages in the world are freshly brewed iced tea and bottled Mexican coke and they had both. Hard choices that are great either way are part of what makes this such a great place.It's more expensive than your typical Mexican restaurant because it is so much more and quite frankly, aren't you worth it?

<Content> I'm with Pete B. -- doesn't live up to the hype.My parents took us to Escobar's as part of their "see - Champaign has just as good dining as your neck of the woods... promise!!" dining tour. This was near the top of their list of must-go's.The food was good, but not great, and certainly not amazing. At our table, we had:- Hanger steak asada - Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin (got the best reviews, but they still weren't enthusiastic)- Sesame-crusted salmon- Sauted shrimp and scallopsThe service was fine, though we were kept waiting for our food for a LONG time. Plus, all entres but one came out at the same time, and it took more than five minutes for the last to show up. I hate when they do that... everyone who has their food wants to eat it but feels they need to wait, and the one person who doesn't have their food is left feeling guilty and telling everyone to start. No thanks.Also worth noting:18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more, "for our convenience. " Really? I've never seen this for under 6, and usually under 8. This is so they're more sure to get a good-ish tip because they're planning on the party being difficult because of its size. 5 people is not difficult, suck it up.$4 Split plate charge. Really? This is not a hoity-toity enough place to pull this off, even in Champaign. Thanks for putting it on the menu, though, instead of trying to sneak it in... at least you're broadcasting your shortcomings.-Overall, given the weird choices they make, the good-but-not-great food, balanced with the meal prices (most hovering in the $20 entre range), it's solidly a two-star experience. I wouldn't return.

<Content> One of the better restaurants in Chambana. A cozy, open dinning area with a small bar. Warm colors, bright and airy. A very comfortable feel. Service is attentive and knowledgeable. The food here is very fresh, and the kind of Latin American/Mexican that I wish more places would make.Appetizers are great. Ceviche is fresh as can be, and I love the Duck Confit taquitos. Main dishes are large, filling, and always fresh as well. Their seafood is great. Tilapia and salmon are cooked perfectly. Wild mushroom enchilada is awesome. They have some sandwiches for lunch that are great. Tacos for early bird dinner, great. You will not find mounds of gelatinous refried beans and crappy rice that come from a can or bag here. You can taste the fresh flavors. A great mix of Latin America and Mexican. They also have a half way decent beer selection in bottles. I usually enjoy some Founders. A well stocked bar, and good mixed drinks. I keep saying this, but it is true. A great spot with fresh and well prepared food. One of my favorite spots in Champaign/Urbana.

<Content> 3.5 starsFor such a highly-rated restaurant on yelp, I was disappointed.We made a reservation for graduation Sunday at 8:30 pm. I called back a week before we went to make sure they didn't screw up our reservation. They assured me that the reservation was still there.Well, it wasn't. They screwed up our reservation, and we had to wait till 9:10 pm to be seated. The group ahead of us, who DIDN'T make a reservation, got a table before us. I asked if there's a point at all to make a reservation, and the owner stuttered. The owner then attempted to seat 5 of us at a small table meant for 4 at most which I thought was a little ridiculous. Being a server myself, I could've found a better spot ESPECIALLY when there's an empty 2-person table that could easily be joined to my table. FYI, the place was busy, but it was NOT packed since it's 8:30 pm on a Sunday night. The also had a special graduation menu which is almost identical to the regular menu but pricier. Food was good, but not great. We got 2 appetizers and 5 dishes, and we all sampled each other's. I liked the duck and the tilapia entree the most. I don't think anyone liked the chicken with mole sauce at all, but at least it was tenderly cooked. I got the red sangria which I didn't really like, but my dad did.This place didn't blow me away like I hoped it would. I've had better food in Champaign.

<Content> So, so, sooo goooood. I have never had a bad meal here. I've lived in Austin for 5 years now, but every time I come home for Christmas, I have to eat here at least once. My favorite is a shrimp and scallop lemon cream sauce dish. The merlot braised short ribs are also pretty awesome. Their white sangria is pretty tasty but maybe even a bit too sweet for my tastes. This place is a bit more expensive than your standard restaurant in Champaign, but it is definitely worth it, if only for a treat every now and then. This place has excellent food and the amount is usually more than I can eat in one meal anyway. I love the way the inside is decorated - it feels very festive without being too obtrusive.Also, Escobars is just fun to say.

<Content> Actually awesome. My friend and I shared the mushroom enchiladas and paella, so we could get a taste of each. I was nervous about the seafood in the paella not being fresh, but I was wrong. It tasted great, not fishy at all. The mushroom enchiladas were good, nothing special but still quite tasty. The service was nice, too. For a college kid, yeah this is a bit pricey, but go here on a date, for a special occasion, or with your parentals! Loved it.

<Content> Had dinner here on a Friday night, and it wasn't too busy. I know there have been several comments about the service, but I felt like my server Tyler was really attentive. The hostess was MIA when we came in so we stood around for a while waiting, even though there were several empty tables. She came up finally and just said 'have a reservation?' I thought immediately: is this Champaign or Chicago ?! The food was ok, I agree 100% with a previous review saying the seafood paella was not a paella- this is correct. It's more of a risotto with seafood on top, which was not seasoned that much to be honest. It was decent, but it was not paella. I had the calamari for an appetizer and it was good, although the way it was prepared was reminiscent of fish sticks. I had the Escobar's Punch as a cocktail and it was good.I would definitely come back, I liked the atmosphere/ambiance. I had a good server but it seems like they still have some overall service issues to work out.

<Content> The saving grace for Escobar's is the decor/ambiance and the quality of food, but I would not go back given the poor service. My boyfriend and I went here for our belated Valentine's Day dinner on Saturday and I had never been there before. When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised with the warmness of the decor. It was very cute.However, when we were seated, it took a very long time for our waiter to get to us. The busboy also kind of tossed/threw the bread bowl on the table which was weird and definitely made me raise an eyebrow.We ordered the guacamole appetizer and a caesar salad to start; my boyfriend ordered the hanger steak and I got the mushroom enchilada. The guacamole was pretty good and both of us really enjoyed our entrees. However, the salad failed to come and our waiter only noticed it once he brought over the entrees. We still got the salad but it was pretty bland and unexciting, despite the enticing description on the menu.The worst part of the evening was the service. Even though our food was good, we could never find the waiter to refill our water or order dessert. He took so long we ended up deciding not to get dessert at all. Even though the interior of the restaurant is cute, I would not go back. Compared to other places in Chambana, the prices are high and I can also get really good food elsewhere.

<Content> While the owners may be Guatemalan, Escobar is a swanky pan-Latino flavor fiesta. It's on the higher end of the restaurants for Chambana, and it's nicely done without being too overdone. I ordered the tilapia, which came in a delicious mixed sauce with sauteed vegetables. YES. 'Twas wondrous.After a great time chatting with fellow graduate students, professors, and a prospective student, it came time for dessert. And they had bananas flambe. Now two of my favourite things in life are desserts and unnecessary applications of fire. And this bananas flambe was absolutely marvelous. I was filled with happiness. And BANANAS.All in all, the service was extraordinarily friendly, the food was well-plated, nicely prepared, and delicious; and the ambiance was pitch perfect. NICE.

<Content> I was a little disappointed with the food at Escobar's. The place was recommended to me by a friend as being one of the better restaurants in Champaign, and the menu online looked interesting, so I decided to give it a try for dinner. The restaurant is really big and was pretty empty when I went (around 8pm on a Tuesday night). After pigging out on the complimentary bread and drinking a mango margarita (tasty if a bit too sweet maybe), I started with an appetizer of fried calamari. I should better than to order seafood in the middle of Illinois: it was certainly not terrible, but it wasn't great either... a letdown for the calamari lover that I am. I then ordered the duck breast: the duck itself was not very good (not very tender and slightly overcooked), and it came with steamed vegetables (boring), mashed sweet potatoes (not bad but a little plain), fried plantain chips (good), and roasted pears (definitely the highlight of the dish: these were actually quite delicious). Overall... not a terrible entree but still quite disappointing and a little overpriced. To their defense, the portions were very large and I was completely stuffed by the time I left the restaurant. Friendly service.

<Content> Escobar's might be the best restaurant in Champaign. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. The wait staff has always been pleasant and attentive. And the food is almost always impressive. I'll acknowledge other reviewers who gripe about the time it can take to receive your food. Going to a fine restaurant should be an event, not something you rush through. It's an experience. I've never found a meal here to take longer than similar fine restaurants. A typical meal at Escobar's might last roughly 70 - 90 minutes if you get an appetizer, entree and dessert. Not unreasonable at all, but maybe a little longer than a meal at Chili's, for instance. ;-)As for the food, you'll be served a small basket of assorted breads once seated. These are always fresh, delicious and unique. Some sweet, some savory. I never know what kinds we'll get, and I always get a little bit excited to see what will be in there. Please excuse my nerdiness. Below is a rundown of some of the dishes I've had at Escobar's. Appetizers: Coconut crusted shrimp - fantastic. The shrimp are enormous and perfectly fried. Served with a delicious orange-jalapeno dipping sauce.Duck confit taquitos - a taste sensation, but at $10 for just 2 taquitos, it's a bit of a splurge. Almost an amuse-bouche than a true appetizer. If there were 4 in an order, getting this would be a no-brainer every time. House made guacamole - a huge portion of freshly-made guacamole, served with a heaping pile of warm, roasted tortilla chips. This is a favorite when I come here. Entrees:Filet mignon and andouille sausage kebobs - my new favorite dish. I have never had such tender, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon in my life. The andouille sausage was a nice, spicy accompaniment. Huge portion. Absolutely delicious. Phyllo wrapped lamb loin - a bit overrated. The phyllo was a little burnt when I ordered this, and there wasn't much of a sauce. Crab cakes with guajillo cream sauce - O.M.G. The crab cakes are light, flaky, fresh, and this guajillo cream sauce - a bright orange sauce, takes this dish to a whole new level. Spicy, smokey - it's a heaping forkful of warm love going in your mouth every few seconds. Love. Sauteed shrimp and scallops - a forgettable, bland dish - and the scallops were gritty (my worst nightmare whenever eating scallops). One of the few disappointments I had when dining here. They do have a small dessert menu. Mango rum cheesecake, lemon curd pie with berries, flan (I never knew I liked flan until I tried it here!). Dessert portions aren't too big, nor too small. The perfect way to end a fantastic meal. Again, service has always been friendly and attentive. Once, we were not waited on for about 10 minutes after being seated. When our waitress realized her mistake, she offered us free soup to make up for it, and gave us excellent service during the rest of our meal. She went out of her way to make it up to us, and we appreciated her enthusiasm. One of my favorite restaurants in the C-U area!

<Content> Wish I could give two different star ratings.Would give 5 stars to the food and the bartender who greeted us and romantically described the specials. The scallop nachos were innovative;the phyllo-wrapped lamb was divine.Unfortunately our service turned frightening when the sweet bartender was shunned to the dishroom and a wicked witch took over the service. She was just plain mean when she delivered the works of culinary art to our tiny space at the bar, tossed dessert menus at us and rudely swiped the check out from under my arm. Granted it was 830 on a Thursday night in Champaign, but in the reality of niche restaurant management you can't treat guests this way and survive! Sorry Chef...you front of the house staff ruined a fabulous meal!

<Content> Escobars delivers with good food and great drinks. Went there on a Saturday evening without a reservation and got a table for 2 outside right at 7pm. Usually we order wine or beer, but this time got our mixed drink on. She had a super strong sangria that was good once you had a couple of sips and I had a Capirinha (sp?), which tastes like a Mojito w/o the mint, but with tequilla instead of rum (I know its not tequilla, but that is what it tastes like). Anyway, that was really strong, too but was not as tasty as their spicy Bloody Maria that followed.Service was spotty for us. Our server probably should not have been assigned our table, as she was busy with a private party in a special room they have. She did not make it up to us in the al fresco dining section as much as I would have liked. However, she made up for it with a comp on the Bloody Maria, so its all good in this hood.The food was great. We had an app of their stuffed pupusas, a great vegetarian dish that is bready goodness just bursting with latin flavors. I had the enchiladas and she had the pork tenderloin. Both were fantastic and big enough for lunches the day after. Since we were on bikes, they were able to wrap the dishes up extra careful for my backpack, and they made the trip back to Urbana no worse for the wear.BTW- There was an obnoxious 40-something biatch next to us getting all nasty with her server about the (extremely moderate) amount of spice in the food. Its not too spicy. If you are think Escobar's is too spicy, then you will never know the joys you are depriving yourself.

<Content> This is a lovely, if noisy space, a beautiful rehab done on several contiguous buildings in the nascent loft district north of downtown. Service here can be spotty, but I have been happy with the food for what it is. It is not really what I would call Nuevo Latino or Latino fusion, such as a Cuatro in the South Loop in Chicago. It is more Americanized, with some influences of Latino cuisine. That said, I have had good steak and pork here, and the tres leches (three milk) cake is excellent. I suggest eating in the bar area. Quieter, full service, there are tables there as well.

<Content> This place has really good lunch options, with the empanadas being my favorite. The bread that they apparently make in-house is also delicious.Dinners, not so much. The first and last time we came during dinner time, three out of three people were unhappy with their items. This is one-third due to the fact that desirable vegetarian options are few and far between. My friend ended up with a cup of chili. My husband had an open-face tamale that was on special. He was confounded by texture and taste. I had a lamb dish that was probably $8 more expensive than it needed to be. Our server was also not that spectacular.I get that it is very exciting to have "fine dining" in Champaign, other than Radio Maria. But, I am not sure that it is fair to say that just because such places exist mean that they deserve five stars, or even four stars. Honestly, I would give it three stars but I take serious issue with how management perceives customer service. Consequently, I will likely never come back here.

This is the best food I've had in champaign. My strip steak was a fantastic cut of meat, prepared perfectly. I sampled almost everyone else's dish, and there was nothing that I couldn't have eaten a whole plate of. Duck Enchiladas, man.Hit it up now, before word gets out and it gets impossible to get in.

<Content> This was not the best meal I've ever had, but it was really great. And, at the risk of sounding like a snobby jackass (which I suppose I am), it's probably one of the best fine dining experiences you can anticipate having in the middle of Illinois.Personally, I was really pleased with the nice wine selection. I don't remember what we chose anymore (it was a red, though), but it was strong, complemented the food well, and was loaded with delicious, teeth-staining tannins. Mmmm....moderately-priced wine...The food was definitely the best part. It was artistically displayed and delicious. I had southwestern crabcakes. While they were good, the red skin mashed potatoes were even better. I savored them until the very end. Mmmm-mm. The Boy had "sauteed shrimp and scallops with lime butter and cilantro-pepita pesto over ziti pasta." This was also delectable. Oh yeah! And we had an appetizer of "coconut-crusted shrimp with mango jalapeno relish." SO good. The shrimp were of the "super-mega-huge"-variety, the relish was to die for (I could eat it all the time), and there was some awesome dipping sauce that they don't mention, but should.The weird bits were in the service. A waitress came over, introduced herself like, "Hi, my name is ____, I'll be taking care of you tonight. Do you know what you would like to drink? Okay, I'll be right back with that wine for you," and then never came back. We saw her go out to her car and drive away. Someone else took over for her, but it took awhile and the personnel-swap was never mentioned. Secondly, we were only one of two parties when we showed up. By the time we left, there were three other tables that were literally seated all around us. The restaurant is spacious enough to spread four tables of people out instead of cramming everyone in a small area. I wouldn't have minded, but it was an anniversary dinner for us, and it kind of killed the ambience. Oh well. It was still nice.

<Content> this was easily our best meal in champaign. we came here for brunch yesterday, and it was delish. my brother had come for dinner before and wanted to try their brunch menu, but unfortunately, they had a special graduation menu which didn't have their usual brunch items but rather dinner fare. to start, they gave us some warm apple/banana muffins, which were delicious. there was one brunch item, which was the crab cakes benedict, so i ordered that. it was a nice portion and came w/ a side of sweet potato fries and fruit. this wasn't your typical side of fruit either, b/c there were papaya, pineapple, grapes, and watermelon in the fruit salad. yum. everything was delicious, including the sweet potato fries. my dad and bro's entrees came w/ a side of a carrot puree, which was yummy, and fried plantains and veggies. i would definitely come again if i came to champaign again. they even had pupusas on the menu, which i wouldn't expect to find in the middle of illinois.

<Content> Wonderful Champaign Restaurant. We went with a group of 9, and it was delightful. The wait staff was attentive, but not over crowding; the guac was absolutely delicious and the portion was very large. I had a Spanish rioja, which made me very happy as well, libation wise.For dinner I had the phyllo and chevre wrapped lamb; the lamb was a little more cooked than I wanted with a medium rare order, but it was still delicious; the chevre/rosemary/phyllo was an awesome, melt in your mouth combination. Veggies were good, mashes potatoes were awesome as well.Overall, I really liked Escobar; great food, we had great company, and a wonderful celebration to finishing theses :) Definitely a Champaign gem!

<Content> MMM MMM Great. High-end Latin food that makes you think your in Chicago its so good, but not the city pricing. The menu is high brow, and smart, but the look is casual. It's a treat that you can get food this good, but wear jeans!I have only eaten there a few times (okay, more then a few because I hate to cook) and the staff has remembered me from day 2. In a town with a LOT of restaurants, this is a huge stand out. Why go eat crap on North Prospect when you can go here!

<Content> I must admit it is taking a little while for this place to grow on me but mainly because I like simple food without all of the frou-frou fanfare. But I thought it worth mentioning that I had a fantastic hangar steak and garlic mashed potatoes there recently. Very simple, just meat and potatoes. It was great.And the restaurants is very nice inside as well, we like the bar area.

<Content> My mom, sister, husband and I went to Escobar's for my sister's birthday -- it was a Sunday so we had brunch. The restaurant was cute -- nicely decorated and comfortable. The waiter was very personable and helpful with suggestions and descriptions of dishes. I started with a limeade, and my mom and sister had coffee -- a fantastic blend developed at the Columbia Street Roastery (which is next door). We were served cornbread with orange zest mixed into the batter. It was a little bit sweet for my taste (but I tend to prefer more savory cornbread in general). We ordered platanos fritos, which were subtly spiced with cinnamon, and served with black beans on the side -- they went together surprisingly well.For brunch, I ordered the California Benedict -- avocado, asparagus, and a poached egg atop an english muffin, covered with a chile-spiced hollandaise sauce. It was quite good -- I thought the little zip in the sauce complimented the eggs nicely, and helped to engage the palate more. I was told that the crab cake sandwich and the salad with egg were delicious as well. All told, we had a great meal -- the only complaint I have was that they did not serve all of the entrees at the same time (although the delay was not long, it did serve to make the eggs Benedict a little lukewarm by the time we all started eating).Anyway, to sum up, the atmosphere was nice, the prices reasonable, the service generally good (and always pleasant), and the food delicious -- I will definitely return here when I come to Champaign again!

<Content> Disappointing food for the high cost.The ceviche ($10) does not come with raw fish cooked with the acids of a fresh lemon, but rather it is canned, cooked fish sitting in bottled lemon juice. The duck taquitos were dry, like frozen ones that were microwaved a little too long. (And they still sold for around $10 for two taquitos.) And the seafood in the paella ($21) was overcooked, and in a sauce that tasted a lot like Chef Boyardee sauce.My colleagues enjoyed the fish filet dishes, though, so perhaps it may be best to just avoid the dishes mentioned above.Besides that, friendly service and a good beer selection.

<Content> Awesome. Actually, half of the owner team is Guatemalan. They also own Milo's in bufu, Urbana but as Escobar is the chef, Escobar's is his place.I always have a good time with their wine staff, especially the lovely salty gal that has only been tending a short while but swigs wine like a sailor, which is to say she doesn't take a dainty white-glove approach. She's a no-nonsense, straight-up pro that can take in a mouthful of wine and nail the flavor notes without all the swirling and sniffing and sloshing. It's the only time I've been able to say, "this one tastes like a chewy, sweaty S&M jock strap" and have someone know exactly what I mean without further explanation. And despite the fact that she's a beer girl, her vino recommendations (granted the list is not as extensive as other places downtown) are excellent.I've done a few different things on the menu but I always go back to their duck a l'orange. The meat is always cooked to succulent perfection and maybe it's because everything on the plate is a shade of orange but the entire dish tastes juicy, earthy, bright and warm. Like 6pm sunshine! Like it's made from Care Bears! I want to liquify it, put it in an IV and jack the whole tasty lot right into my veins!The mussels are excellent as well and my friend scarfed the ceviche on our last visit (I had my face in the mussels - so much for sharing).The bread is baked in house and they have a bombin' spicy corn focaccia so it's easy to load up on table bread guilt-free because you can't nosh on Escobar bread anywhere else but Escobar's.Most importantly I like this place because the food is so good and the staff is so nice that it doesn't need all the flash and glam of other restaurants to earn five stars on yelp! The closest comparison I have is the cluster of restaurants out in Napa: sun-drenched, family-owned, friendly and in an epic love affair with food. Outdoor seating means gazing into a parking lot as cars zoom by but it is still the only place in Champaign where I am a little saddened at the end of my meal because I don't have four stomachs, four wads of cash and four hours to sit and eat four more servings of Escobar's duck a l'orange.

<Content> Matre d' gratuitously, breathtakingly rude as we walked in. I gave him a chance to simply apologize and he used it to justify his rudeness. Full disclosure: I didn't know whether we'd have 5 or 7 guests (it's ebertfest). Fact is I wasn't rude to him: he treated me like he thought I was an idiot. A basic principle of good resto services is to avoid gratuitous meanness, even during ebertfest. I'm a local, love their food and won't go back. People deserve to be treated with basic civility, esp when they are civil to you. The second waiter's apology later sounded a bit more genuine, but not enough. Goodbye Escobar's. I hardly knew you, but I'm not coming back, and I'll be telling my friends. I recommend not going.

It comes with avocado, cheese, sweet potato fries, and a small but sufficient green salad. They also serve warm muffins to eat while you wait for your food. I love the cornbread muffins with a touch of butter--mmmm. I also really like their fish tacos.I've had various servers and they have all been friendly, without being too eager for tips.

<Content> Going to lunch at 1pm at Escobar's - empty... but why?? Maybe it's the location, but this place should be jampacked with yuppies with elitist tastebuds and students looking for a foodie $$-saving deal. With the quality of the food here, you'd actually expect the service and dress to be a bit more uppity but surprisingly, it's casual and laidback (a good thing). The menu seems to be well-balanced; can't go horribly wrong with any choice.Foods I thought stood out: the Spanish rice (not too dry and nicely spiced) and the Mango-Rum cheesecake (a fluffy cheesecake! tricks you into thinking it's healthier? i'll succumb...).

<Content> This is definitely one of Champaign's nicer dining establishments. I went in with a friend for lunch. It was pretty empty in there, but it was sort of after the lunch rush and it was during the week. We promptly were served ice cold water and some delicious banana bread muffins with butter for free. I ordered a freshly squeezed limeade, a nice twist on lemonade. My friend and I both agreed on getting the Cuban sandwich. So many different flavors playing into this sandwich. Sliced ham, a deliciously marinated shredded pork, Monterey-Jack cheese, pickles and a whole seed mustard topped off the sandwich served on baguette bread. My friend commented on how he doesn't usually enjoy mustard but really enjoyed it on this sandwich. The sandwich was accompanied by a side of mixed greens in a vinaigrette and some sweet potato fries. Sweet potato fries are always an A+ in my book and the mixed greens were a good add too. The fries and salad weren't anything to get super excited about, but definitely yummy and helped fill me up for sure. Left there with a whole other half of my sandwich and one of the muffins. Lunch is extremely reasonably priced and although I understand it to be a little more expensive for dinner, I can't imagine being disappointed from what I saw from this meal.

My only complaint is that the bread and rolls were cold and the service people were confused about who would be helping us at first. I got the hanger steak with fajita veggies and it was amazing! Veggies were cooked perfectly. I could have eaten a whole plate of those.

<Content> They get points for presentation but that's pretty much where it ends. Service: Decent and attentive once we flagged someone down and asked to talk to someone about ordering! It took them about 5 minutes to get to that point.Appetizer: We had the morrocan-style mussels; probably the only well-seasoned dish of the night. Tasty, but not the best I've ever had.Entrees: The seafood paella is not a paella; its a bunch of seafood in a pot, with rice and sauce buried at the bottom. It was a beautiful presentation, and the seafood was cooked well but woefully underseasoned. None of the sauce touched the seafood, and the sauce was sub-par at best. It's Latin American food, right? Seasoning?!The phylo-wrapped lamb is an inventive dish, and beautifully presented. I think their chef went to beauty school, not culinary school. Again, underseasoned and the glaze seemed to be missing something...salt probably. Drinks: The mango margarita tasted like it was laced with lighter fluid or nailpolish remover. Their wine selection was really good.

<Content> WOW!!!!!!A great place for a fine dining evening. A couple friends and I went to Escobar's after reading some rave reviews. We entered the restaurant and the place was packed. It was about 6:30. We didn't have to wait long before they offered us a table in the bar room. The ambience was nice and the food was delicious.Our wait staff was a little slow and it took them a while to come around to refill our water and our bread basket, but the entree and overall experience made up for it.I ordered their white sangria. I must tell you that if you like sweet and fruity drinks, definitely order it it. It was so good that my friends decided to order it as their second drink.For our food, we decided to start off with the Coconut-crusted shrimp with orange-jalapeo dipping sauce. It was pretty good. The best part was the sauce.My entree, I ordered the Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin filled with goat cheese, rosemary, and coriander, served with red-skin mashed potatoes and port reduction. It it a mouthful to say and I must say that it is worth every word. The lamb was cooked perfectly and all the sides were very complimentary. I would definitely order this dish again.Overall, I give this place an A. I would definitely go back to try all the other dishes on their menu.

<Content> Dear Escobars Management -- If you are listening. . . I have been a loyal patron of your restaurant for years. You've been up and down, HOWEVER. . .   Yesterday I came in for brunch with visiting family on Easter, and our waitress was an embarrassment. The food was good, but what strange service.   She was clearly on a diverse mix of prescription meds, because she had a hard time communicating with us. The food was cold, because she brought it out one plate at a time for a group of 6, and proceeded to talk our face off as we were about to leave, despite being cold and indifferent during the rest of the meal. A little training might be in order here. Maybe you had the B-team on staff for Easter - but y'all need to check yourself before you wreck yourself.

<Content> Great choices that are well prepared. I had the ceviche tonight followed by the pheasant and it was delicious. Only complaint (and this is a bit snobbish) would be that there was a little much onion in the ceviche. Besides that the wait was fairly long (25min) for my entree despite the restaurant being almost empty but I have to say it was definitely coming straight out of the oven and the preparation of my pheasant did not leave anything to be desired. Solid 4 stars. If I was back in town I would come here again.

<Content> I wanted to like this place, really. I've been here twice. The first time, I ordered the duck dish, and I was underwhelmed by it. The second time, hoping I'd just had bad luck, I brought a group for my birthday. I had the lamb, which was OK, but not worth the price. One of my friends got a cocktail glass with lipstick still on it, and another friend's entree had a long hair in it. The waiter said that it didn't look like any of their kitchen staff's hair, which was almost worse. The owner came out to apologize, which was nice, but they didn't do anything beyond not charging my friend for the dish with the hair in it. That friend mentioned to the waiter that it was my birthday, and they didn't offer a dessert or anything else to me. I won't be back, and I don't think any of my friends will be, either.

<Content> What took me so long to try this place? I've passed by so many times and thought about it but I finally took the plunge. I'm so glad I did. It's a lovely location. It's nicely done but unpretentious. The wait staff was incredibly friendly. Refills were quick in coming and we got our food very quickly. As you waited you are served a basket of various tasty breads.We started with the coconut shrimp. It was absolutely delicious with huge, perfectly cooked shrimp covered in a tasty coating. The coating was very light and wasn't as sweet as some coconut shrimp can be (I think that was a plus) and it was served with a slightly spicy sauce and and a small bed of greens, onions and mango. The flavors were spot on. You only get four shrimp total but the shrimp are quite large and it was a good size portion for an appetizer.I had the chicken mol for my entree. Finally I have found a good mol in Champaign! I seriously had given up hope of finding a decent version of this sauce here, let alone an excellent version. I've tried just about ever mol sauce in town and it's almost universally bland with little more flavor than the sauce black beans are canned in. But this sauce had a great smokiness, a slight cinnamon undercurrent and the perfect amount of spice. It's served over two large pieces of chicken, still on the bone. The chicken was wonderfully cooked. The presentation was also a plus. It was served with Mexican rice, black beans, cooked fresh vegetables, a fresh salsa and two large plantain chips all on a banana leaf-covered plate. The portion is nicely sized. Every element of this dish was superb. I really cannot find a fault with any of it and everything went so well together. The vegetables were even cut beautifully!My dining companion had the lamb dish and from the bite I had it was phenomenal as well. We finished off the night by sharing the chocolate-covered orange cake with raspberry cream. I would probably be a little afraid of how something like that might turn out if the meal I'd had wasn't so delicious. The desert did not disappoint.It's not a cheap place to eat dinner, although I took a look at their carry out lunch menu and they had some really great options all in the $10 - $11 range. And sometimes you really do get what you pay for.

<Content> Escobar's just opened a few months ago, and it's far enough off the beaten path that I imagine they're missing out on walk-in traffic. I've only had brunch there, so I can't comment on the rest of the menu. The brunch menu isn't too breakfast-y, but the options are tasty, and the portion sizes aren't ridiculous. Our service the first time was excellent, and the second time, despite an almost empty dining room, our service was so-so. The interior is gorgeous, especially the bathrooms. I wish the menu changed more regularly, but they're new - this will improve in time.

<Content> Went Thursday night for a late dinner with my husband. This was my first trip to escobar but middle son, who had been there before, refused to go because he claimed the atmosphere was too uninviting. This was unusual for him to refuse to go out because he is a serious boy-about-town and never misses an opportunity to experience anything.OK, i'm sorry to say the aesthetic sensibilities of my 12 year old are a bit more fine tuned than whoever designed the interior of this restaurant. It's all hard surfaces so the feel is very cold and extremely loud. I asked my husband twice throughout the meal if he would be mad at me if I asked the people at the table next to us to stop laughing in such an annoying pitch. Since he reminded me that i am not Larry David and nobody would find it funny, i refrained. onto the food. we had a spinach salad with mangos, shrimp, cucumbers, and red onions in a citrusy dressing. this was good. definitely fresh. then we had a grouper over rice with veggies...eh, it was ok. very large portions as in enough to feed 2 hungry adults, which worked well since we shared everything. the fish was very fresh though so i give it 4 stars for that. then we ordered coffee and bananas flambe. the coffee had to be sent back because it was so weak and instead we ordered espressos. i rarely ever send anything back probably because i hate wasting anything, but this was reeeeeeeeeeeeeally bad coffee. Our waitress even agreed that she has to doctor her coffee when she drinks it here due to the weakness. But the bananas and the caramel sauce...now that is worth 4 stars. Would i go back? No. Should you try it? Yes. There seemed to be a lot of people there having a good time, laughing loudly.

Also, my boyfriend and I happened to get there a little early for the early-bird special from 5-6pm: fish tacos (or a couple other options), plus soup for only a $1 more. We tried the red pepper gazpacho and some kind of pork stew; both were delicious. Definitely recommend this place!

<Content> Yum! I finally made it to Escobar's, and I was not disappointed. The food was excellent and the portions were the perfect size. As is the case with Milo's, the dressings on the salads were divine. Escobar's is not cheap, so minus one star, but it's a great destination for those special evenings when you are willing to spend some money on a nice meal out. The white sangria was particularly noteworthy.My complaints would be that they were stingy with the bread. They only gave us three slices of bread, a boring white and wheat and then some sort of corn foccicia thing that was really good, but two of us had to split a small piece so I really didn't get to enjoy it. Also, on the jicama orange salad I had, they served the orange in slices rather than segmenting them. This meant chewing on nasty orange membranes instead of simply enjoying the lovely combination of flavors in the salad. I know it's probably more labor intensive for the kitchen, but when a diner pays $7 for a salad, you need to segment the damn oranges. Overall though, these were really small things that really didn't damage my overall enjoyment of the evening. My entree and dessert were absolutely wonderful, and the service couldn't have been better. The food wasn't spicy at all, but was still very flavorful. I personally would like to see a little kick added to some of the dishes, but it would be icing on the cake and they are fine without it.All in all, I really enjoyed my dinner at Escobar's and plan to go back. It's not cheap, so I won't be a regular, but I certainly plan on coming here for birthday dinners and the like.

<Content> Escobar's has a lot going for it: location, friendly service, a chef who is fearless and skilled. What it doesn't have going for it is timing. Spouse and I have been there several times, and each and every time, there has been a timing problem in the kitchen. We've had dinners come out two minutes after our appetizers (and then left to overcook and dry out under heat lamps when we sent them back so we could eat our first course BEFORE our main course.) We've had main courses come out for half the table, with the other half left to wait five + minutes for theirs. Any time we've been there that someone has asked for a deviation from the menu - the last time it was "no potatoes or rice, please" - the kitchen misses the deviation. Spouse and I have had many good meals there, although not great. For us (and I stress this may just be us, having read other reviews), the portions are WAY too large, and the dishes can sometimes be needlessly complicated. The lamb wrapped in phyllo with chevre fell apart so that it was impossible to experience the textures and flavors of the phyllo, lamb, chevre and sauce in the same bite (will say the phyllo and chevre together was really good.) Add in the rice that came with it (the one we tried not to get), and the overall dish was mostly just...starchy, which stepped all over the more subtle flavors of the lamb. Like another reviewer here, we liked the dish, but it was too heavy handed. Too much food and too many competing ingredients. While the kitchen timing issue is annoying, it's not our ultimate problem with Escobar's. Escobar's just doesn't seem to trust how very much it has going for it already, so it keeps piling other stuff on, just in case. The result is a meal that always makes us feel slightly bludgeoned afterwards and we end up returning to other places over and over before venturing to Escobar's again.

<Content> Outside seating however only a few tables. Obvious good service. Great bread started with sangria and a mix of bread some jalepeno some cinnamon. Calamari was fried, large, and excellent. Larger than anything else we have had locally. Dinner was the talapia with a honey glaze and chile sauce. It was also good. The chef poured the corn cream sauce on half of the talapia. A simple and wonderful idea that let us enjoy the dinner in different ways. The side vegetable mix was great too. Obviously cut and cooked right before the meal. The better half had a steak with a port reduction sauce. Same fresh vegetable mix. Note, I mentioned to the waitress I do not like peppers. Without asking she made sure there were none in my dinner vegetables. Good, thoughtful service. Wine menu was OK, but would not stop us from coming back. Easy parking. Outside seating.

I had phyllo wrapped lamb with goat cheese and a red wine reduction one of the last times I was there, it was cooked just right and delicious. The wine list is kind of small but I always find something that suits me. Great date place or with a group of friends...can't wait for the patio to open up!

<Content> Pricey but amazing. Everything I've ever had there is top-notch. And when you're there for brunch, you get bottomless MUFFINS! And they're amazing muffins. Try the pupusa if they still have it on the menu (I think the menu changes a lot). This place TROUNCES Radio Maria. Trounces. I can't believe more people don't go here. I suppose it may be due to its location, which is a bit lonely.

I went late evening with a friend and paid $15+ for some watery mole and burnt beans. Sadly, this is the best Champaign has to offer, but if you want some real high-end Latino food stick to Chicago.

<Content> My girlfriend and I went here for the first time on Easter weekend. We started off with the calamari with aoli and their Moroccan beef soup as the appetizer. The calamari wasn't the traditional type you'd get at mainstream American restaurants but it was thicker pieces of squid with panko breading. This non-traditional set-up was quite good although the sauce that came with it could be a little bit more tangy. The Moroccan beef soup was very good, beefy but not overbearing. For the entrees, I ordered the Phyllo wrapped lamb and she the duck roast. The lamb was excellent, it came wrapped in a flaky Phyllo pastry and a succulent sauce. The sides were also superb, although I could use a little less garlic in the mashed potatoes. The duck was cooked to perfection, although the plantains and mashed sweet potatoes were left a lot to be desired.We shared dessert, which was the banana flambeed with vanilla bean ice cream. It was amazing, although it is quite hard to mess up something so innately satisfying. Overall, the presentation was superb and the waitress courteous. The atmosphere was fine for the occasion, although my girlfriend did complain about the "orangy" walls... haha. In any case, I highly recommend Escobar's for a good meal.

<Content> Great place for a lunch or dinner - with the office or friends. The lunch menu is full of great options. I always get the grilled chicken with guac and it's always good. I can't usually eat it all because they give you so much. The sweet potatoe fries and salad that come with it are my favorite. I think I would be happy with just those two items. Their house salad dressing is different and I love it. I believe they even have their own homemade ketchup if I remember correctly, good! For dinner, I only get the Broiled tilapia with chili-honey glaze, sweet corn-cream sauce, and fried rice - WOW. The spice from the tilapia goes great with the corn. My favorite fish around! Portions and price are perfect.

<Content> A great place to eat without burning too big a crater in your pocket and if you want to impress your date or out-of-town relatives (or both!). The food and service is both great. I usually get their salmon dish (it seems to change a little bit each time) and it is always a winner because it is not dry but not too moist. I also tried the carne asado (medium-well) and it was also a wonderful dish with tortillas, assorted veggies, and rice and beans. Their beer selection has some variety in case wine or sangria is not for you and if you are sick of the usual suspects. I have gone here three times and it still never disappoints. This one is a winner indeed.

<Content> Update:A few of us just went to Escobar's again, and it was awsome! However, the waiter was indifferent, but the food great.These are my wishes for any restaurant:1) A good waitstaff. Notice I didn't say GREAT...because I don't believe they exist anymore. However, this was met.2) I want my water full. I rarely order drinks at restaurants, but I do want my water to be kept full at all times. This too was met.3) I want the food to be at least as good as I could make at home. It's common sense, but I hate paying $20.00 for a plate of something that I could have made better for $5.00.4) I want to leave feeling that I got my money's worth.I found all of these things at Escobars. The food was great, I had NO complaints.Mmmm...

<Content> Great restaurant, but little pricey for what you get, in my opinion.I like that most of the time it's not so busy you can't get a table--usually we're sat pretty quickly. The food is always delicious. Apps I've tried:They also have some of the crunchiest calamari I've ever had, since it's panko-crusted rather than the usual cornmeal treatment. Super crispy, and not at all chewy. The duck taquitos are good, but pretty expensive for the three little taquitos you get. Entrees:Crusted salmon--really good. The corn chip crust gives it a nice texture and the flavors are really well balanced.Fish tacos--some of the best I've had in the area, and you can get a nice deal by going early and getting their early bird deal.Drinks:The mojito I had was good, but not great. It tasted a bit too much like sprite to me, but it didn't seem too weak, thankfullyA few gripes that hold Escobar's short of 5 stars:Most things I've had (even apps) come with what initially seems to be a nice little mixed salad, but I find the lime dressing pretty poorly made. It's just too overpowering, and leaves a bad taste in my mouth.The last time I was in, my date and I decided to order a few appetizers and split an entree. No problem, our waiter said. He brought it out on two separate plates even--awesome! But when we thanked him for that, he informed us that we were being charged an extra $4 mainly because "we give you some extra vegetables." Would have been nice to know when we were deciding/placing our order. On that note, I find most of the menu items a few dollars more than I am expecting, even after dining at similar places in Chicago. They clearly know what they're doing in the kitchen, and I appreciate that, but $10 for four small tequitos seemed a bit much, for example.Despite those issues, I really do like this restaurant a lot. One of my favorites in C-U.

<Content> I was looking for a place to go to for my anniversary with my boyfriend. I read tons of reviews of restaurants on Yelp and decided to go here. It had pretty decent reviews and the menu that I found online looked good as well. It went downhill from the moment we walked inside. We went on a weekday evening during finals week (I'm a student on campus) and there were only a few tables filled (by few, I mean literally 3 tables). We waited 5 minutes before we were even addressed, even though my boyfriend and I were the only people waiting in the front. It took another 7 minutes to seat us in an almost completely empty restaurant. We received our menus and some bread (which was good) and water. The waitress came by to announce the specials, one of which included some udon noodle dish which confused me because they do not fit the cuisine of the restaurant (Latin American-esque vs. japanese), which I thought was odd. Being from Chicago, and having experienced real Latin American/"American" food, as well as actual good food, I would definitely not label this restaurant as it has been.We ended up ordering the phyllo-wrapped lamb and the beef stew. When the food came, I couldn't help but notice how limp the "vegetables" were. They looked like they had been defrosted from a bag of mixed vegetables. The mashed potatoes that came with the meal were also just so-so. It had big chunks in it, like they didn't even take the time to mash them all the way. The lamb was alright. It was cooked well, pink in the middle, but the goat cheese on the outside (between the phyllo and lamb) was overpowering. The beef stew my boyfriend had was accompanied by the same limp vegetables and half mashed potatoes. The stew itself was nothing special either. We didn't order drinks or anything extra, and our bill was still over $45. It was hardly worth the price for the amount or quality of food we got. I definitely will never go back. The food was less than inspiring and the service was horrible.

<Content> To begin I don't pretend to be a restaurant review swank; however, I have a background in customer service and have a knack if not passion for trying new things. I came to Escobar's because it looked interesting and is merely a short jog from my house. Upon arrival my girlfriend slipped and fell due to a slick spot on the floor. This wasn't a great start, but I did enjoy the atmosphere and thought the decorating/ attention to detail might hold true with the food. I ordered an Erdinger beer and the Moraccan salmon, she ordered a white sangria and the filet mignon. The waitress came back shortly with my beer and a red sangria. We let her know that she had ordered the sangria white and she apologized and quickly brought us a white. While waiting on the entree we nibbled on the bread which was good. Our entrees arrived in the expected time and I was rather pleased with the salmon. It was the perfect texture and had a radiant flavor (southwestern/latin), the filet however was a different story... The first comment my girlfriend presented was is this cooked. She had ordered the filet medium and it was rare... as in veiny mushy oozing blood rare. Again we let the waitress know and she agreed and brought the filet back to the cook. To give the cook credit she let us know that the cook had stepped out for a minute and that the guy that had cooked it was a trainee and that the actual cook was making her a new filet as we spoke. To sum it up I work hard for my money and though I'm no posh snob about giving it in trade for a proper service I feel like I got the short end of the stick on this one.  We were offered a free dessert but were ready to leave so we declined. I expected our ticket to reflect the errors they made, however no discount was given.

I basically felt like I was eating straight cumin. However, the sangria is great (although quite strong). My favorite item was the main course. I ordered the scallops and shrimp and thought it was wonderful! Perfectly cooked and a lot of great flavors. It's a little pricey but the main entree was worth it. My husband had the pork tenderloin and thought it was great. Skip the guacamole but get the scallops and shrimp dish!

<Content> Excellent food! First time eating there. We started with the coconut shrimp with orange jalapeo dipping sauce served with salad greens on the side. Although the dipping sauce sounds hot, it wasn't. It was more of a citrus and jalapeo flavor and it complimented the coconut shrimp quite nicely. We tried the hanger steak fajitas for our entree. It's a good thing we were able to split the entree as it would have been way too much for one person. The steak had a wonderful mole sauce with a little kick. And the vegetables were not typical for fajitas. Asparagus, carrots, onions, red & green peppers. Also had a side of black beans and rice with black beans. The regular margarita was one of the best I have had in a restaurant. The menu is seasonal and changes quarterly, so you may or may not be able try something that is suggested in the reviews. Timing is everything! I would definitely go back when I'm visiting Champaign.

<Content> Honestly, just okay. I had red sangria - "house special" - and it really wasn't very good at all. Brought out bread to our table but no bread plates or silverware...we couldn't find anyone to flag down, either. I had the tilapia, which actually was very tasty - the fried rice that came with it was great. Dining companion had a steak special which looked good. We were not offered dessert (or a dessert menu), and it took FOREVER to get our check and pay our bill. I think next time I'm in Champaign I'll stick to bar/grill food and save my "fine dining experiences" for the Chicago area.

<Content> A group of us went in and everyone found a dish suited to their tastes and prefrence. Even though we were all somehow related we represent a diverse group. My daughter was just back from Spain and other countries beyond. She was thick into the land of authentic tapas. My oldest son is just expanding his pate a bit beyond McDonalds and my youngest son is up for most anything these days. My 90 plus year old mother has allergies and is crazy food sensitive and really is not fond of much in the way of anything edible these days. I was wondering if she would turn her plate over and make a face. Thank goodness no childhood flash backs cropped up for her. My brother in law is strictly carnivore. I was impressed that everyone found a dish. Well done Escobar. Oh, and I recommend a mojito if the weather is warm or maybe if you just are wishin warm breezy thoughts. Ha ..If somehow you find they don't have them available..go home and have one ..they make family time much more tolerable.

<Content> Rave reviews from most of my more selectively-palleted friends. However on two attempts, just haven't seen what all the fuss is about. Service has been average to bad. Last time I went with my lady friend on Saturday before Valentines Day. Made a reservation which they screwed up and stuck us in a corner four-top while several other more cozy two person tables sat vacant during our whole meal. Menu was special for valentines day and had several options. I chose tilapia and my girlfriend got the filet. Being a wine couple but not familiar with many wines from outside the U.S. I asked for a rec from the server who admitted to having no idea on wine pairing and left to go ask someone. Even at biaggis their servers are trained in that. Very disappointing at a higher dollar establishment. Remainder of meal not impressive. Tilapia was average and would agree with some of the other posts in that it was too much food and not enough contrast in flavors. I forgot to mention the coconut shrimp app we got that was also disappointing. No coconut flavor at all. Too full for dessert. Filet that I tried nothing special either. For my money- Radio Maria, Milos when it was in Lincoln Square(haven't tried new location), even Jim Goulds. Just so much better service, ambience, and food selection and quality to come back here again.

<Content> ate here a couple weeks ago with my family who was visiting me. my grandma is pretty snooty about restaurant food and she loved her entre, she had the ravioli. my grandpa said his filet was pretty decent. i had the phyllo wrapped lamb loin...it was amazing -- great place to eat, good service.

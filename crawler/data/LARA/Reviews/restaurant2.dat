<Content> Well, this is more of a 2am type place but heck why not try it at 5pm! Well we were the only people in the place but! I ordered a Veggie Burger that was just delightful for a dinner! It was a huge patty pouring out of the bun! Threw some Ketchup on it and was completely satisfied for the evening a head of me! I bet this would have tasted even better at 2 am after some drinks! This place is open 24 hours a day and is set up perfectly like an old dinner from the 50's or 60's! The staff was very polite and took very good care of us! Like I said we were the only ones in there but they could have ignored our empty glasses of water but they did not! They treated us like Dinner KINGS! Probably the cheapest place to eat in downtown Champaign for sure and it was great!

<Content> Arrived in Champaign late on Christmas Eve and the hotel had stopped serving food. We hit the snow-filled road to find some grub...actually I was pining for a piece of pumpkin pie. The Merry-Ann's near our hotel was closed but we spied another one that was open 24 hours.It was as if I'd walked into a time warp -- the menu, the decor, and the pricing was unusual for this California gal. I was thrilled to get a piece of pie and even happier for the $2 price. There's nothing on a menu for $2 in California, not even a sharing charge!My partner had a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich with fries. It may have been the processed American cheese slices...but she was hungry. I'm glad I wasn't too hungry because the vegetarian options were quite limited and if I'd stuck to my veganism, I'd be SOL.

<Content> I came here after an unfulfilling dinner at Big Grove Tavern. We sat down for some fries and a slice of pie. Everything was great, the pie was delicious, the fries were hot, and the service was prompt and friendly. Everything was great, that is, until I start hearing noises behind me. I assume someone is dragging a chair across the floor.  I don't turn around, because it stopped soon enough. Time passes and the sound starts up again. My S.O. starts looking a bit uncomfortable. I turn around, and no one is dragging a chair, but there is a man 2 booths away. It was him. Farting. Having a fart-attack. A super-extended fart-attack.Having quickly lost my appetite, we asked for the check, left the server a hefty tip, and skedaddled. I can't really blame Merry-Ann's for this. This is a place for everyone, farters included! So if you want a cheap diner, this is your place, but be aware that this is a big world, and flatulence happens.

<Content> What a travesty that this is the only place to get late night food around downtown Champaign!!! Even when I've stumbled in hammered at 2 am I thought the food sucked... now that's saying something! Unfortunately, this is the only place to get some sober-me-up food after a long night of drinking at dt Champaign so I'm going to undoubtedly return at some point. But I do have to say that I will never get that nasty corned beef hash again...

<Content> I'm going to be completely honest here: the food at Merry Ann's really isn't that great at all... Nothing terrible, just mediocre diner food.So why four stars? - It's dirt cheap. Seriously. They have a fairly long menu and almost every item is under $5. Try to beat that.- It's open 24/7. Now that's unheard in downtown Champaign, where every other restaurant closes at around 11pm. So yeah... the chances are that I'll be back.

<Content> I can't help but feel that the foodies who love this place only do so with a kind of hipster irony. When ordering at Merry-Ann's, "Occam's razor" applies: go with the simple choices. See a particular dish on the menu that you'd consider ordering? First, imagine yourself cooking it at home...now count all of the potential steps where poor decision-making or lack of skill could result in disaster. Choose the dish where there is little room for error and you're set.On my first, misguided visit to Merry-Ann's, my youthful enthusiasm (and naivete) led me to order the Mexican omelet. What was I expecting? Maybe an egg-licious concoction with chorizo and peppers. Instead I got something akin to a burrito with scoops of taco meat, where the thin skin of egg acted as a wrap. I openly and unashamedly admit that I am a snob in this regard--due to early childhood trauma involving Taco Bell, I simply refuse to consume oily ground beef cooked with packets of "Mexican-flavored" seasonings. The meal didn't make it far past "Go" before it had to take a few steps back... Err.With that experience behind me, I still gladly stop by Merry-Ann's, but now I stick with those simple dishes, like eggs, breakfast meat, and hash browns. All the breakfast combination plates are pretty reasonably priced and the serving sizes are more than adequate. I don't recommend the dinner items (remember Occam's razor?).The overall ambiance of the place is above average. Compared to campus-town's IHOP, Merry-Ann's is bright and clean. The kitchen isn't in a separate room, which allows you to observe that a good deal of the food items are microwaved. Maybe those people who have food industry experience wouldn't be surprised or bothered, but most places aren't quite so brazen about the nature of food preparation.For standard breakfasts, Merry-Ann's is a solid choice, especially as it's the only real 24-hour game in town and within easy walking distance of all the downtown bars. Still, I'd recommend keeping your expectations low.

<Content> The food is clearly average generic diner fare, but the staff are super friendly. Especially Maria from Zacatecas. I go here to practice my Spanish, get a great cup of coffee and pretend I'm in California on occasion.And don't tell anyone else--but I sometimes get hashbrowns with country gravy, transfats be damned. :)

<Content> Merry-Ann's is one of my Champaign memories. We used to drive to Champaign to visit some of the bars. One occasion, I was taken to Merry-Ann's afterwords. Very busy when the bars closed, but oh so yummy. They have a haystack with: hash browns, sausage, gravy, eggs and other stuff I believe. Ad a chocolate milk on the side and it is a drunk boys heaven.

<Content> I'll admit that food-wise, Merry-Ann's certainly isn't worthy of four stars, but for me it's more about nostalgia. We always used to go to the one on Kirby and Neil back during my U of I days, but now when my husband and I go to C-U we'll occasionally go here for breakfast. Their breakfast fare is actually pretty decent and insanely cheap. Everything else is pretty much meh. Typical diner fare. Milkshakes are super yummy, though.There can often be a wait on the weekends particularly during home football game weekends, but it's never very long at all (and I suspect there's probably a wait at most other places, too). There's a parking lot adjacent to the building which is convenient--and there's easy access to 74.

<Content> Merry-Anns is best in the wee hours of the night, (or morning) when your judgement is down and a huge greasy plate of fries, a burger, and milkshake no longer sounds like a bad idea. Or just when it's 11PM and you decide you need an omelet and pancakes. Or when you are out on the town and simply no where else is left open to feed your poor, wandering, hungry soul.  It's 24/7 diners like this, that while never your first pick when deciding where to eat, you realize are vitally important to life when the above conditions arise. The food is super greasy, comes out super quick, and costs the right price. The food tastes good, but really people, most things that are greasy are going to taste delicious. You definitely get enough for the price you pay as well. Service is hit or miss. The restaurant is set up so you can actually grab your own extra silverware, condiments, or napkins if needed. Despite the closeness of the waitress, she pretty much takes your order, brings food and drinks, and then throws your check on the table and that's the end of that. You don't go here for the service though. It is midnight on a Tuesday night and you want scrambled eggs and waffles damnit.

<Content> Honestly, this place probably deserves just one star. However, I experienced Merry Ann's tonight with a delightful mixture of old and new friends. Some of my friends were drunk, others were not. All I had was a milkshake, which was decent. One guy ordered some eggs, which looked and tasted like rubber. The atmosphere is mediocre, with no music and just the buzz of fluorescent lamps. The seats are hard and uncomfortable. Despite all this, I enjoyed my time at Merry Ann's today, so I'll give it 3 stars.

<Content> If I may be so bold as to say this, Merry Ann's is a celebration of everything that is good about life. The only downside is that in this case, too much of a good thing could possibly lead to atherosclerosis or some equally undesirable cholesterol condition. Who can not honestly say they don't harbor a soft spot for those 24 hour diners, whose men and women work tirelessly throughout the night in order to provide us, the host inebriated, with industrial strength coffee and omelets at two in the morning?The food at Merry Ann's, if you've never been, is pretty standard for diners. Breakfast served all day, so you can get pancakes with the folks on Sunday morning, or pancakes at 4:47 in the morning after your friends push you in a shopping cart to the front door of this imperial majesty. I was originally planning on giving them three stars, but Merry Ann's got an extra star from me for their bacon preparation technique. Most places hand you burnt, crispy bacon-- Merry Ann's gives you greasy bacon still glistening with fat, fresh off the fryer. The only way to eat bacon. The aforementioned pancakes are a tasty deal too. They're fluffy enough, and the taste can be drown in one of the three fine syrup offerings located at your booth. Service is fast, friendly, and always ready to fill up your coffee. And if you're at Merry Ann's, you will probably appreciate that.So overall, Merry Ann's is cheap, delicious, and convenient. Located in proximity to the downtown Champaign bars, you will always have a place to sober up for a few hours. Champaign suffers from a dearth of 24 hour diners in my opinion. I refuse, out of principle, to go to the Campustown IHOP. Even if the stories I've heard about the place aren't true, drunk undergrads still sounds pretty terrible to me. I miss the spots like Denny's and Norm's... but I feel like Merry Ann's does its duty, and does it well.Keep on keeping on, Merry Ann's Diner.

<Content> I don't get the hype. The food isn't anything special. The price is a little high for the food you get. The ambient, well it's a diner. Somehow, my friends seem to love it. I feel like I only go here either after the bars or in the morning after a night out at the bars.

<Content> Cute little diner, open when you need it to be open (after the bars close). The food was pretty cheap in my opinion (burger and fries for $5.15). And if you order one of the breakfast combos, you can switch regular toast for french toast! If I hadn't already been set on ordering a burger, I would have been all over that, since french toast is my favorite breakfast food. And they were quick with the food- like under 10 minutes from the time we ordered to the food being put on the table, and we had 5 people in our group. And you can see the cooks, and how they handle your food- it's all out in the open.I will definitely be back.

<Content> This Merry Ann's is MUCH better than the one on Neil. It is cleaner, nicer, and the staff is way friendlier. They let you study as long as you want here, and even offer to plug in your computer behind the counter! The guy that works here at night is super nice and very attentive, and I just love that he wears those cheesy shirts with whales on them. I have been here to study and get some late-night food several times. It just gets difficult once the post-bar crowd comes in around 2am.The chicken fingers and fries are good, especially because their honey mustard is delicious. I've also had the hamburger with fries, which was fine also. The prices are cheap so it's nothing fancy. I've never been here post-night of drinking, but I'm sure it would be amazing at 3am after 6 PBRs.

<Content> After having a horrible experience at the other Merry-Ann's Diner during the winter we decided to try our luck at the downtown Merry-Ann's a couple of weeks ago...and wish that we wouldn't have because we were again disappointed. We walked into the diner to find that we were the only customers, which should mean that we would have great customer service...our waitress was one of the worst we have ever had. We only saw two people working in the diner and one of them spent the majority of our meal time scrubbing the floor...mind you just scrubbing it and bringing up all of the dirt and scum, not actually mopping it off (that part of the process must have happened after we left)...the entire floor area behind the counter and by the cooking area was covered in a black/brown mud/scum/dirt mixture which made for a very unappetizing eating experience. My husband ordered a double cheese burger with bacon and fries....he was brought two single cheese burgers with no bacon to be found. The waitress placed our food on the table and then disappeared to the back, so we were unable to complain or get the order corrected. I ordered a plain malted waffle....it was a waffle, waffles are good and pretty hard to mess-up...so, overall, my food was good, but I would never be able to refer to it as great. Prices are reasonable, but the lack of customer service and waitresses who are unable to take orders correctly ensures that we will never be going to Merry-Ann's Diner again. We have tried both of them and were deeply disappointed with our experiences.

<Content> Merry Ann's is a great place to go after a long night of drinking. Some of my favorite memories are from here: most recently, my friend announced to the entire diner that my fiancee had re-proposed which caused hysteria (but no free items, unfortunately). The Diner Stack is G-d's most amazing gift to drunk and desperate vegetarians wanting to break free for one night.

Ordered the Cheese and Mushroom Omelet. Good portion but the cheese tasted processed and the mushrooms tasted canned. The hash browns were good and the side of bacon was done to perfection.

<Content> Garish lighting, hard plastic seats, and mediocre diner fare. On the other hand, open 24/7, fast service, cheap, and very very tolerant of loud, obnoxious, uncooperative, and drunken clientele (which, admittedly, my friends and I were last Friday. Correction: my friends were; I, as DD, unfortunately (?) was not). Final assessment: Excellent place to sober up (or not) after a prolonged night of drunken debauchery in downtown Champaign. Probably wouldn't go there otherwise, because being the lone sober one at an otherwise mediocre diner sucks =P

<Content> Between 6 hungry people, we ordered:1) Indonesian Fried Rice2) Crispy Beef3) Crispy Tofu4) Chicken Lo Mein5) MaPo TofuPlatters are around $7 each and everything is cooked fresh to order. The flavors are amazing here and the service is amazing, the food comes out quickly. It's feel-good, home-away-from-home cooking. It's no wonder there's always a lot of international students and a few home-grown midwesterners eating here - they've discovered one of the best spots for Asian food in Champaign. (And the engineering quad is also right across the street!)It's not a fancy place. You'll clean your own plates when you're finished and when you order, you'll be given a number which they will call out from the counter. You can grab your own silverware, napkins and cups of water/tea from the big kettles near the cash register and clear your own dishes when you're finished. But what they lack in pomp and panache they make up for with good food and cheerful service. Simple as that.If I had to choose to order one thing consistenlty, it would be their crispy tofu. Hefty wedges of soft tofu are lightly breaded and fried. It's served topped with strings of fresh green onion and this incredible thick garlic dipping sauce, which I would eat with plain rice. It's that good! And it's my favorite.The Indonesian Fried Rice comes with a fried egg on top and their MaPo Tofu comes spicy (chilis bring it on), in a very sharable portion. Our dishes also came with the soup of the day, something along the lines of egg drop soup with tomotoes. Here you will get an affordable meal with amazing Taiwanese-Indonesian-Chinese flavors.When i was a student here, I would mostly order take-out and the portions would last me at least two meals. Come here if you want a filling, hearty meal that will nourish your heart and soul. Dining in is great to eat family style since the dishes are shareable. If you come consistently enough, I think you'll find your favorite dish that you'll want to order every time. The owners are incredible people who take great pride in their restaurant. They know they are a beloved spot on campus and treat their patrons in the same way.

<Content> My second take-out Chinese experience in Chabana while here at school, and it wasn't much better than the first. My roommates and I decided to order from Cravings after realizing the Golden Harbor might be too expensive. This was probably a bad decision as we had moved from probably middle tier Chinese to low tier Chinese food in terms of price and quality.The General Tso's chicken was just OK, I've had better and it honestly more resembled orange chicken in both taste and looks.Others got a beef dish and a seafood combination which was on the Chinese menu. I had no clue many of these restaurants have Chinese menus that are often more authentic and probably better quality and tasting than the regular menus. I need to order off those menus and not the Americanized ones for future reference.The fried rice was pretty bland as well. Eggrolls not very good, either.They forgot to include a side order of crab Rangoon and when we called back they said next time we are in the Rangoon will be free. I wasn't impressed with the food but in all fairness it was like $6.50 for a large portion so at least I wasn't hungry afterwards.I still want to try some of the other Chinese places in Champaign as well as ordering off the non-Americanized menus. I think the cuisine is interesting but the quality just hasn't been there at the last couple places I've tried.

<Content> First time in Champaign, IL and I went to my trusty Yelp app to find a tasty place for dinner. After reading the reviews for Craving, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, the summer hours aren't updated on Yelp and the place was closed early on Sunday night. Oh well, Monday night, I returned and boy, was I glad I did.This place is about as dive as you can get. But we all know, good Chinese restaurants are all about the food...so I dove into the menu. I was happy to see they had a "Chinese" menu for the real authentic dishes. I ordered the mushroom and tofu curry. It came with a small bowl of seaweed soup and rice. Extra rice was free (which is always should be!) as was the hot tea and ice cold water. The curry and the soup were both delicious.I returned the next time to try their famous hot and spicy chicken. WOW! The servings are enormous. There is a reason why this is the most popular dish...it was amazing.Cravings is a must try for Asian food lovers. I highly recommend it.

<Content> Generous portions and cheap price. A college student's dream. I got the chicken with vegetables for a lunch one day. They give a wide array of vegetables and the sauce was good but the chicken was okay. They give you soup along your lunch so that was nice (though I didn't really like the soup). The dish was yummy but I'm sure the other choices are a lot better. Such big portions so this could also be split between two people or saved for later.Decent food but I do prefer Golden Harbor.

<Content> Well, almost exactly one year later, I've revisited Cravings as my first lunch after coming back to CU. While the points I made last time about the interior still stand, I did try the Jakarta fried rice, and it was quite good! Good enough to bump this up to 4 stars, but alas, I had some bad service this time around. A mistake was made when putting in my order, so I ended up having to wait 20 minutes for my food. I couldn't even sit down to wait since all the tables were full. Ack! Just 3 stars then...P.S. Excessive use of styrofoam - cups, takeaway boxes, and bowls for small soups, all in styrofoam.

<Content> More Authentic, cheaper prices. I'd have to say this place is a better priced for portion Chinese place while still maintaining a high quality sense of food. I've been here multiple times and my friends extremely love this place (their favorite being the Jakarta fried rice). I've tried a plethora of their menu and enjoyed every single one. Don't think you will be disappointed if you come here, the only complaint is that, it is quite small during busy hours, it might be difficult finding a spot to eat in the restaurant with a group

<Content> Cravings used to be our go-to lunch spot for Chinese food on campus. Food are not exactly authentic nor delicate, but there are some nice choices (e.g., eggplant beef stew, fish fillets with spicy tofu sauce); portions are big and price is cheap; and the owner is super funny. However, their food is not always fresh, and like another reviewer said, they had failed food safety inspections so many times that they were close to being shut down.One star because my husband went there again this evening and got food poisoning and got VERY SICK. Lesson learned and just wanted to caution everybody. Would be three stars for the good memories...

<Content> This is one of my favorite places to get Chinese food on campus! They are really fast and the food is delicious. The owners are extremely nice and accommodating and best of all, the food is very inexpensive. Every time family comes into town or I have friends over, we make our way to cravings for a great meal. You order at the counter and they call your number when you food is ready and all you do is go and pick it up yourself. No fuss dining. There is also free water, hot tea and plastic utensils in the front - server yourself.Here are some dishes I love:-spicy fried chili chicken: fried chicken pieces that are stir fried with scallions, spicy chili and sweet yellow onions (spicy and delicious! - all time fav!)-salt an pepper squid: fried strips of squid stir fried with green peppers and onions (crispy and irresistible)-masala fish: battered fish stir fried with masala spice and veggies-eggplant with ground pork: the eggplant is soft and tender, which is well balanced with the rice ground pork-pork belly-clams with black bean sauce-mapo tofuThe staff is super friendly and have great recommendations if you're not sure what to get. Overall, great food! This place gets packed pretty quickly so make sure you snag a table!

So usually when I walk in here I just ask him whats good today and I just take what he recommends.For fans of uber spicy dishes, try the chilli chicken.Yes the place is dingy, but its really cheap, especially if you split family style. You can call ahead to order.

It had every kind of Asian dish on the menu, and while I'm usually weary of places that have more than one kind of cuisine offered, this one delivered.I ordered the sweet and spicy udon soup with chicken and it was amaaazing! My boyfriend also really loved his beef curry. The portions were also huge and everything was really cheap. I don't know how I've been a townie and not known about this place. Gem!

Table was dirty, started to wipe it down as I noticed the manager was standing there watching me and not offering to help.All the other reviews rave about the bang for the buck on tasty food and I'm willing to bet they're right.

<Content> Cravings is one of the best cheap authentic Chinese restaurant on campus. Their location, price, and portions are unbeatable in all of CU. My favorite dishes are:-Pork belly with preserved veggie-Fish with Shanghainese bokchoy-Fish Marsala-Mapo Tofu-Jakarta fried rice-Chicken and veggie (or chicken lo mein)-Crispy chicken/beefThe one thing I don't like is the smell inside so I usually get take out and it's always crowded so it's good to call ahead and pay with cash when you get there for that discount. However, make sure you pay the meter because I went in to pick up take out and when I got out there was a ticket :(The only other comparable place is Golden Wok but it's a bit far on University so you'll need a car to get there (they have free parking)

<Content> Living at the corner of Green and Wright, I should have seen my addiction to Cravings as inevitable. There is a huge menu with a lot of great items. My favorites are the General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Jakarta Fried Rice, and the Hot and Spicy chicken. The food is delicious. The prices are great. You always get more than enough meat and a side of rice. That said, the place is kind of sketchy. There are rumors that it was closed for a few days in Spring 2013 due to health violations. And I'll admit, I have seen a bug or two crawl around right on the menu. But with the delicious, greasy food that comes out of here, I'm willing to eat a couple bugs. Definitely worth it. Pro Tip: Call in your order for pick up and start walking there. By the time you get there, your order will be ready to go and all you have to do is pay. Boom.

<Content> Man. I was wary about this place, because it looks like every other Chinese food place ever and I don't like most takeout restaurants. But it's really really good. Sure, it's not the swankiest of places, but if that bothers you so much take your food to go!First of all, the guy running the place is so cool. I told him I wasn't feeling well and wanted some soup. He was like, I have JUST the thing. Not long after, I picked up a huge bowl of soup with big ol' chunks of fish cakes, squid and shrimp. It was a hot and sour seafood soup with noodles, and it was nice and spicy. At most places, when they talk about spicy food, it's not really that hot. Not so at Cravings. I am used to eating spicy food and I was wiping my nose.Gross, I know.Anyway, the ingredients taste fresh and the portions are huge. They provide water and tea for free, which is great when it's cold outside. And they give great takeout containers for soups. I know, it's the little things. I'll definitely be back to try more on the extensive menu. Hm, I wonder if they deliver...

<Content> A little bit of home away from home. A wide selection, healthy portions, cheap prices, and consistently yummy Chinese food is why I really like it here. Cravings reminds me of my mom's cooking which is always a great treat when I'm feeling homesick or just get ridiculously sick of dorm food (which is often). They have a very extensive menu with something for everyone, they have lunch specials for even cheaper chow, and the owner is very friendly (yay for discounts, especially if you go often). I would recommend any of their noodle or rice dishes (I frequently go with Ma Po Tofu or anything with chicken ^^) and they cater all people from those on special diets, vegetarians, Americanized Chinese food (think orange chicken), to the more traditional dishes.You can take-out as with most Chinese restaurants, but I've always sat down with friends when I eat here. Good eats.

<Content> I am hesitant to give out 5 stars on Yelp, but Cravings earns mine without a doubt.This is not only the best Chinese food in Champaign-Urbana, but also some of the best Chinese fast food I've had anywhere. I'm from Los Angeles, where we claim Monterrey Park and Alhambra as the official China Town of America, at least cuisine-wise, but I find that Cravings beats out most of the places I've eaten at out here.During the year I spent living in Urbana, I frequented Cravings almost every week, and during that time I have tasted almost half the items on the menu.Most students coming grab a lunch-sized dish for $5 or $6, but ordering the $8 or $9 full dishes pays off if you plan to be out studying all day. You get so much food that you can easily take half of it with you to go, so you can finish it later while studying at the library or wherever.Menu highlights include the Mongolian Beef, the Marsala Fish (careful, very spicy!), the spicy crunch chicken, or if you want healthy, the seaweed seafood dishes.If you're just a beginner, you might want to just stick with the Mongolian Beef, General Tso's chicken, or Kung Pao just to experience how they do the classics so well and full of flavor, then move on to other items in subsequent visits.My biggest regret in leaving Urbana is being able to taste the food that this wonderful Malaysian family has brought to corn-field country!

<Content> There are really better options, both in Champaign and on campus.I don't really want to say that, because I used to love Cravings. Like many of the people writing 5 star reviews, I was impressed by the large menu, the frequently cheerful staff, and the mostly reasonable prices. But as I went to other Chinese places in town, my opinion began to change. I noticed that most of the dishes at Cravings were really heavy and oily. And that most of the specials were very similar to one another. And that some of the menu options .. didn't really match what was being described. I don't mind some innovation, and I know you can't really get a Japanese style bowl of Ramen anywhere in Champaign, but Cravings' offering is nowhere close.The last three times I went I ended up throwing out my leftovers. I absolutely hate wasting food, but I couldn't finish them. One was a squid special; the squid was extremely chewy and seemed overcooked. The plate was mostly green peppers in a salty sauce, in any case. Another was a "coconut shrimp" plate. This translated to fried shrimp with (very sweet) uncooked coconut milk simply poured over them. Unhealthy and not even tasty. The last was Gado Gado Fish, which I remembered getting and enjoying in the past. It was still really heavy - lots of breading with an oily, thick sauce. If you want to spend a little more money, I highly recommend Golden Harbor instead. But the food is much better.If you want to spend about the same or just a little more, I'd check out Lai Lai Wok instead - which I think is overrated, too, but is a bit better than Cravings. Or you could get take-out from Rainbow Garden, which is pretty solid. If you want to spend less, you could try out Empire or Bo Bo China. (Bo Bo China is all you can eat if you really want to maximize your calories/dollar.)

<Content> Having spent 5 years at the University of Illinois, Cravings was far and away the hot spot for the college of engineering (across the street from the engineering campus) students for lunch or dinner. I must have been to this place over 50 times. The staff is extremely friendly. Every time I go there I ask G' Tao (owner) for a new dish based on my preferences, he never disappoints. Only knock on this place the food is a little oily and I wouldn't consider it healthy eating haha. But when the food is this good who cares!Long Story Short: There have been several times where I was bashing my head at the computer lab working on an engineering project and just said "Screw this, I'm going to Cravings". Nothing saved the day like food from Cravings. Shop Notes: Pretty small shop and gets packed pretty quickly around lunch and dinner. Service is very quick and efficient, take out is always a good option. Very reasonably priced with pretty large portions.Sentence Summary: Is the food entirely healthy? Not really. Is it delicious and authentic? Absolutely.

<Content> This is the tastiest Chinese food on campus (note, Golden Harbor is not on campus). It is also the cheapest, and they give large portions -- for me, easily enough for 2 meals usually. Most dishes are $6-8. Some more special ones are $9-12. The more American orange/General Tso's/sweet and sour/etc. chicken dishes are $5.25. The owner guy behind the counter most of the time is one of the friendliest restaurant workers I have ever met. Tips:-They make Chinese food the best. If you're unsure of what to get, your best bet is to get something Chinese instead of Japanese/Thai/etc. -Be sure to look at the white board on the floor to the left of the counter! -Explore the Chinese menu sitting on the counter (it has English translations) These are some of my favorites: Basil pork egg rice, Jakarta fried rice, Pork with preserved vegetables, Crispy beef, Fried fish fillets with bok choy, Beef stew eggplant pot, Spicy fried chicken, Mapo tofu, Sizzling chicken pot.

Additionally, it wasn't sweet, and there were a lot of onions in the dish. A lot!The ingredients (rice, beef and onions) were fine, but I can't eat something that has been sitting around for awhile and isn't fresh and hot.I'll try this place again because the owner is a nice guy, but my first experience wasn't a good one.

<Content> Cravings definitely has the best Chinese food I've had in the area, and probably ever. I highly recommend the Sweet and Sour Chicken (an American favorite); it's perfectly crispy and delicious. Also great are the noodle soups, and the red curry. The guy who runs the place is awesome, and even though it's usually packed, I've never not found a place to sit down. I wish I could give Cravings 5 stars, but I can't. Their menu is too big, and, as a result, you can find some serious misses if you order incorrectly. I've had some of the best Asian food at Cravings, but also some of the worst. They should record everything everyone orders for a couple months, and only keep the top 20% of all items sold (which would result in a menu that's still too big).If you haven't been, go with someone, someone who you trust, who can help you to order correctly, and you won't be disappointed.

I'd recommend not getting tofu from this place, although I still love the chicken lo mein and hot and spicy chicken.

<Content> I ordered takeout with a friend, after he said this place was really good. I got a vegetable - udon noodle dish, since my spot in line came up before I was ready and I had to make a snap decision. I also got fried rice and crab rangoon. I wish I had more time to decide, but we were in a hurry. The menu was much larger than I was expecting, divided into different regions, and I would love to come back and try something else.Total, including tax, came to around $13, which is pretty good for the amount of food I got. Even though I was warned to be ready for a wait, and it was the dinner rush, we got out in probably about 15 minutes. My udon ended up being good, if a bit plain. The crab rangoon was good, and I wish I had more of it, but it was not spectacular. I was told the fried rice was very good, though a bit on the salty side. Looking at the other reviews, I suspect I will have to give this place another try and order something different. Maybe it will blow me away next time.

<Content> OK.First I need to say that I'm not a Chinese food fan. But, I like some kinds of it.Ambient of this restaurant is very bad. There is always a smell and smoke inside. Because of that you may start coughing. This is a very bad thing!Food is OK. But I had better experiences about Chinese restaurants, so this is not my first option in C-U.And, price is reasonable, actually cheap. However, service is so slow. So many people order by phone before they're coming to this restaurant. To sum up, if you wanna have a Chinese food, Cravings wouldn't be your first option, as long as you're not specifically try the food of "South China". I recommend Evo, in C-U area.

<Content> Ah, Cravings. My old stand-by Chinese place. Good food at a good price. They have both the typical Chinese fare that most Americans are used to and a pretty full true Chinese menu. Orange chicken is really good, so is the Mongolian beef. The only thing I've been disappointed in there is the veggie egg rolls.

<Content> I've been coming to Cravings every couple weeks for the last two years or so.It is the best Asian restaurant in Champaign County, bar none. Golden Harbor is a close second.The two workers who deal with customers are the friendliest restaurant workers I think I have ever encountered. After fifty visits here, I have never seen either one in an apparent bad mood. They're just happy people, and happy people make great food.FYI: Whilst observing the magic behind the curtain one day, I did see them cooking the vegetables by blanching them in a deep fat fryer along with the egg rolls. -- And that's why Chinese food tastes good, folks!

<Content> Yes, yes, yes! These people aren't goofing around! Although this restaurant is lacking in atmosphere, this is fully made up for in quality and quantity of food. It is by far the best tasting Chinese I have had on campus, for a bargain deal too! Bang for your buck, get some takeout and give it a try.

<Content> What is this concept of paying cash and not having to pay tax? Hrm...Takeaways:- Crispy sesame chicken covered in just the right amount of sauce (as in, not doused)- Good size- Incredible price- Free hot tea- Bus your own plates and garbage- If you need a takeout container, just grab it from behind the counter. No fuss.No wonder Cravings is crowded and busy all of the time. Warning though, expect takeout and not to eat in. There's also no delivery.

<Content> When I brought my sesame chicken in to the lab today, it was met with a chorus of "where did you get that," and "oh, yeah, love cravings!" It's that rare kind of place that has both nasty, american, super fried chinese food, and real, actually eaten by some asian people somewhere in asia food. And it's dead cheap!

<Content> Outstanding....i usually get the american "chinese" like general tsos, sesame chicken, etc. The jakarta fried rice with tofu and veggies is also amazing. Really cheap (about 6 bucks) for a d-lish hot meal. I usually try not to eat the whole plate because it is definitely more than one healthy person should eat, but i usually can't stop myself. couple of types of tea for free while you eat in...gets packed during peak times around noon and dinner time, so seating can get hard to find, but getting it to go and eating at home or outside somewhere works just as well.cravings is the go to place for us ae students in the area...someone always has it in the lab, and always makes me want some...actually, in all honesty, after writing all of this, i am walking straight there.

<Content> I've been going to Cravings for lunch about 2-3 times a month for the last 1.5 years, and have had a whole bunch of items on their menu. Most items on their American menu and Chinese menu are just fine (wouldn't get more than a 3-star ranking), but their ma la fish and Singapore chow fun are absolutely amazing!!! And the best part is that you get a lot of food for ~$8!

<Content> I LOVE this place and if I had a million hours to waste I would walk my lazy self across campus and pick up some sweet and sour chicken and have a free Styrofoam cup of green tea every day of my life. Unfortunately they do not deliver and I don't even think they know how to use a phone. The last time I was there the man was so busy he picked up the phone and put them on hold and never picked it back up. I found it funny, but I'm sure that customer did not. And, you know, if they opt out of delivery they should really clean the place up a bit. I get worried what the kitchen looks like and have peeked back there a few times to see complete chaos (mostly because there's 8 or 9 women cooking for too many customers to handle). I love the food, but this place is great to go to maybe a few times per semester. It's just too crowded for my liking.

<Content> Holy Mapo Tofu! I ordered this the first time going and I was blown away. There was no fuss in "holding the meat", so I think this place is pretty veg-friendly. It was packed when I went to pick up my food, but it was ready in the short walk it took me to get there (less than 15 min).I will sample much more from the menu but based on their Mapo tofu alone I will easily award 5 stars.

<Content> Ok, Cravings is an interesting experience. There is no atmosphere. The food is sketchy. The line is usually long, it's crowded, and the huge menu is scattered in about 5 different places, making it a little weird the first time you go. But you will be back. I don't know what they put in their food here, but everything is just really, really tasty. It's not going to win any culinary awards any time soon, but for the cheap price, you get a lot of downright delicious chinese food. I've probably been here at least a hundred times over my years on campus, so I'll try to keep this review condensed. Go to Cravings. Order the hot and spicy diced chicken. And never look back.

<Content> I will admit that I am not the most adventurous eater. I am especially wary of Chinese restaurants. Good Chinese food is awesome; bad Chinese food is one of the nastiest things on earth. So I rarely go to a new Chinese place without someone telling me that it's worth trying.A couple of my husband's co-workers (who were very in-the-know about Chinese food) told him that Cravings was one of the best in town. We tried it, and it became one of our mainstays. We usually order the crispy beef, which is lightly breaded and fried (I think) and then tossed in this incredible sweet-spicy sauce. One order is enough for both of us, and unlike other places that do not use the best part of the cow when they are breading and frying it and tossing it in a delicious sauce, the beef is usually really good--not tough and stringy and fatty and gross.The man who owns Cravings is very nice, and I'm always happy to see crowds eating there. They seem to have authentic dishes along with the Americanized stuff, so if you want a steamed whole fish, you can get one here. I would try other things, but I am too addicted to the crispy beef to move on.

<Content> I've been living off Cravings these past 2 years, literally.They have a big menu so the tip is you know what to order. Don't just try something randomly as you might have a negative experience.The owner is very nice and every time I ran into him in Champaign, he always remembered me and said hi to me.Dishes that I recommend include -hot & spicy chicken (my go-to dish. I had this like everyday last spring); -mapo tofu (really good, spicy, and only 6.50 for a very generous portion); -gado gado chicken (nutty and sweet);-masala fish (crispy and spicy fish fillet); -beef pan fried chow fun (stir-fried beef with large noodle, really good);-Sizzling chicken pot (I have to stress it. it's SIZZLING chicken cooked with basil and onion);-Pepper and Salt Squid (apparently everything starts with "Pepper and Salt ___" is really good. Try pepper and salt fish also).Some more Chinese dishes that I like:-black mush room & tofu w/ groundpork;-basil pork with rice;-bean noodles with ground pork (a lot of people asked me what I had when I ordered this dish);-hot & sour seafood noodle soup (tom yum based, with LOTS of seafood, perfectly for a cold day);(these 4 dishes above can be found on the white board near the counter).The Mongolian beef is good but it's not consistent. I like it to be a bit overcooked, but sometimes it's still a little rare to my liking, especially during peak hours.These dishes are all from the Chinese menu since i'm not a big fan of Americanized dishes in general.

<Content> Cravings is one of those restaurants that you would just find reasons to go back to. This place is really for what it offers inexpensive. There is no real service, and I don't seem to mind that one little bit. You order at the counter, and for your order you are given a card with a number on it. And a few minutes later, your food/number is called out which you can take back from the counter to your table. Oh yeah, you are expected to bus your own plates once you are done eating. Now the food: they have a wide range of Chinese and adapted Chinese cuisines from Malaysia, India and Indonesia. Their menu is super long but surprisingly this doesn't seem to effect the consistency of the food made. Unfortunately, my food recommendations might not work for you as I am vegetarian. But anyway, Green bean or vegetables stir fry in Hunan sauce seem to my usual picks. Jakarta fried rice with tofu is also something that I really like. They have some soup and Chinese tea for free, which you can ask the owner about. The owner is real friendly and always indulges in the occasional chat if he happens to be unoccupied. I did take a star out though, because sometimes the tables are left dirty. Because of the absence or regular cleaning staff, the tables are left dirty sometimes by inconsiderate customers. Be warned, the tables are packed if you go during the rush hours. All in all, you have to love cravings!

To put that into perspective I am 260 lbs and yes, there servings feed me for two meals, so if you're a 120 lb female you could probably get a weeks worth of food from one meal here. Large portions are one thing, but the food is also amazing. I have ordered countless authentic and Americanized items off of their menu and all of it was great. As far as campus Chinese restaurants are concerned this is the place to go. Golden Harbor might be a bit better as far as quality, but it isn't on campus and isn't nearly as cheap.

<Content> The reviews looked good, and a Chinese friend of mine recommended it, so I tried it. I went in during the lunch hour, and it was jammed, mostly with Asian students and staff. The owner was very friendly, and even with a packed house he offered me complimentary Chinese or chrysanthemum tea. My test of a good Chinese restaurant is to first order some Americanized dish, and if they make that well, then the authentic dishes have to be good. I ordered sesame chicken to go. The aroma driving back to the office told me something good was in the styrofoam container. I opened it, and there was the delicious smell of toasted sesame. The flavor was quite nice, but the dish was ruined by too heavy a coating of cornstarch and overcooking.Most of the pieces were very dry and hard to chew. I'll go there again, but next time it will be noodle soup or fried tofu.

Everything else is also amazing. I've made it a goal to try everything they offer by the time I leave Champaign and so far of the dozens and dozens of things I've tried the only thing I didn't love is their Gado Gado. The man behind the counter is super friendly and recognizes me everytime I go. They give you as much rice as you like when you eat in. The only downside is as far as I know they don't have any duck on the menu.

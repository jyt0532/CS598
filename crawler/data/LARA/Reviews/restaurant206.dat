<Content> In a town where most of India restaurants are below average. This place is reasonable. Decent taste, well priced.BTW buffet is below average. I always get takeaways which are much better. Don't judge this place by buffet.

<Content> I personally love this place. It's so tasty and you get a bunch of food for only $8 if you order the buffet option. All of the workers are really friendly too and are really responsive waiters. I crave it every now and then so I'll stop by 2-3 times a month. They have some really good rice pudding and a bunch of awesome Indian dishes that i don't even know the name of but will shove my mouth anyways. I always leave happy and tired from eating too much.

<Content> My review applies to the lunch buffet only, I may (or may not) try the dinner menu. I found it average at best, the kind of Indian food that is good for people who don't like Indian food. Boringly mild, and lacking the range of flavors that is so appealing about subcontinental cuisine. I may return, but it will likely require some kind of sedative, or grand deception.The establishment itself is clean, and the people friendly. As far as restaurants go, it's fairly good (except for the food).

<Content> We were craving Indian food while on the road about two hours from home returning from vacation. I assumed there might be some good places near UIUC. And while this joint is nothing to write home about on the outside, it is the inside that matters.And boy, is that inside good! My party of six all had the buffet, and everyone loved it. It might have been the best meal we had on vacation, and the price was right to boot. The food was spicy enough to please my heat-loving palate, but there were mild entrees for the less adventurous. Service was, in a word, good! And you can't always say that.All in all, I'm glad this restaurant is far enough from home that I cannot just hop in the car and go there any time, because if I could, I'd be there twice a week.

<Content> I went here recently on an almuni trip with some friends and were recommended to go here for lunch. The restaurant was very clean and had nice decor and lighting. We were pleasantly pleased by the lunch buffet selection, there was a good variety of different foods. Prices were very reasonable for lunch. And for a weekend during summer break, there was a respectable crowd in the restaurant (showing the popularity of such a new restaurant).While the food was not as spectacular as Bombay Grill, the pricing and variety will mean we will probably be back here on the next campus visit.

<Content> I have eaten here over 10 times and I can't believe that I haven't written a review yet. I don't know where to start in this review. The two factors in regards to me liking a place are 1) the food and 2) the service 3) if much of its clientele hails from the region in which they represent/serve (only important to ethnic establishments). I could care less about the ambiance or anything else like that. The Food- They have a buffet and a menu. I have eaten a lot of Indian food, but I haven't even scratched the surface of everything that is out there. If you're like me an occasional (or in my case 3X in one week) trip to their buffet will help you discover new Indian dishes. They serve different items everyday. The buffet menu of the day is posted on their FB page.  Through this buffet I have discovered my love for paneer and Indo-Chinese. In addition, they occasionally put out items not in their normal menu, such as the amazing Chicken 65. I have ordered out on their regular menu on three or four occasions based off of amazing items I discovered from their buffet. They have an extensive menu of roughly 100 items.The service- I have never had an issue with the service here. I am as white and as pale as can be, but I love my spicy food even though it doesn't love me. Due to my genetic flaw I may drink a lot of water when eating spicy food. They are usually quick to refill my water, which is extremely important to me. Tonight I officially met the owner even though I had spoken with him there on several occasions. He is an extremely nice guy and has helped me navigate the menu when I have had questions. He seems to genuinely enjoy his business and being there.The other stuff- Yes, a lot of Indians eat here, which means a lot when it comes to ethnic establishments. If they are eating it then it must be good. The other stuff including the ambiance and prices are unimportant to me if the two previously mentioned requirements are great. I guess they are of some importance as I prefer to eat in clean places and don't have endless funds. Moving along...the restaurant isn't big. There is limited seating and it can be packed (a good sign). It is clean, but there is nothing special about the ambiance (again, unimportant to me). The prices hear are a cheap. The buffet runs under $9 regardless of it being lunch or dinner. Most of the menu items also run less than $9. in fact, I can't recall anything running more than $9. I think you should easily conclude that I recommend this place if you like good Indian food.

<Content> This is my go place on campus lately- close to my department, reasonably priced, and the food is great. My only complaint is that the naan could be a bit crispier. Their saag paneer and chicken tikka masala is very good. I'm not one to get too hung up on service, but theirs is excellent as well. The only downfall is limited seating- But, if the place is full, as it usually is around 12-1, you can get take out buffet by the lb.

<Content> I was so excited when Ambar opened up! My husband and I LOVE Indian food. So much so, that we had it catered at our wedding! The food here is delicious. The lamb korma is PERFECT to my liking. Trust me, I get it everywhere... The naan is huge and fresh. The portions are decent. Sometimes I get my own dish, sometimes I split one with my husband.I prefer the menu to the buffet, but I feel that way just about anywhere I go. However, a lot of people do get the buffet.It can get really busy being next to campus, so if you don't like crowds, avoid this place on a Friday night. The prices are decent. The staff is friendly. If you're on campus and want Indian food, go to Ambar and not Bombay. Seriously.

<Content> Just went here today, was less than impressed. I ordered the Vegetable Biryani (wanted to try something that the cooks would be least likely to mess up -- kinda apprehensive about trying this place initially, haven't heard too many great things about it on campus, but I was craving Indian). It was just okay. Maybe even a little less than okay considering this dish was $8.99 for RICE. Whatever, they gave me a huge mass of rice BUT I am 100% certain they use frozen vegetables in the rice, which was my main disappointment. They absolutely used the frozen mix of ridge cut carrots, lima beans, and peas. Come on! What happened to fresh vegetables??? If you're going to be charging almost $10 for RICE, I wouldn't expect my meal to be anything less than fresh.Beyond this meal, can't really rate this place on their other options. Probably won't be going back when I need to satisfy my Indian food craving.

<Content> When I heard that a new Indian restaurant was opening up right next to campus, I could hardly contain my joy. Campustown badly needed another budget Indian restaurant, and Ambar India fills the void perfectly. By no means am I an Indian food connoisseur, but the dishes that comes from both menu and buffet service taste phenomenal. I have been there several times, and I can't exactly recall the names of the things I ate, but trust me, they're great. And if one particular dish doesn't satisfy your palate, there are plenty more that will. The buffet changes daily, so there's no shortage of new flavors to try. Best of all, the lunch buffet is only $8, probably one of the cheapest and most fulfilling meals you can get for your money.Vegetarian options are limited for the buffet, but as a meat-eater, it isn't much of a concern. If you're looking for something with more flavor and spice, try ordering a dish off the menu, but be aware that the portion sizes are a bit on the small side.

<Content> I went there for lunch. Honestly I have had better indian food than this but what made me give one star was an incident there. As I was standing in line for buffet, a guy came out and started putting dishes (I guess he was a dish washer) First he stepped on my foot and no apology. WTH. Then he went inside, came out and hit my head. Srsly? I didn't want to make a hassle since I went with my friends but I am never going to go back to this restaurant nor recommend this place to anyone. Owner should train his employees.

<Content> So this place suffers the same issue that all buffets do: average quality food for $10. If you want some Indian food, then it's fairly good. The choices don't seem many compared with other buffets. The coconut soup had a piquant spicy taste to it that I suggest anyone try.

<Content> Tried the lunch buffet (takeout). Cheaper than other Indian places in the area but due to the small location size less variety of food as well (half the buffet table is salad bar/dessert/sauces), so it evens out. Nice touch: they weigh the buffet takeout, so you don't have to pay the full price if you don't load up.Naan: just ok, but I did get takeout so it might've suffered a bit in transit. Naan is best fresh and hot.veggie korma: very good, nicely spicy, good flavor, vegetables were good quality.pekora: nicely crunchy even after sitting in a styrofoam box for a few minutes, little salty.palak chana: good, nicely spicy and flavorful, right thickness of saucekidney bean chickpea thing I forget the name of: kind of bland, I usually expect more fire in this dish.tandoori chicken: not great, surprisingly. It was dry and surprisingly hot (spice wise) while being less flavorful than I'm used to. Maybe it'd just been sitting around for awhile (its hard to make dark meat dry!)lemon rice: yellow rice with fried peanuts in it. I liked the peanuts, gave it a nice crunch, but didn't really taste anything else flavor wise; could've just been plain old basmati rice.chicken curry: ok, this is why this place dropped a full star. The chicken curry is bone in, which would be fine if it were whole bone, but the bone is cleaver-chopped, which leaves tiny shards of barely-detectable bone EVERYWHERE. Seriously I was picking through this thing like I was dissecting in a lab to make sure I didn't kill myself with every bite. I don't even remember how it tasted. I realize this is 'authentic' but so is using a cow-dung oven to make naan and I'm betting they don't do that. Debone your chicken curry, you're gonna get sued.The interior decor is really quite nice (a huge change from when it was Wonderdogs, you won't recognize the place), the music wasn't too loud, there was a refreshing lack of tv blaring in the corner, the proprietors are very nice and conscientious, and things were moving along well in such a tight space (you're not going to like it at lunch rush if you're claustrophobic/have a phobia of strange people bumping up against/brushing by you). The vegetarian dishes are better than the meat dishes, and I didn't try everything available on the lunch buffet (two or three more items, a lentil soup, desserts (mango custard sounds really good but I didn't want to mingle flavors).Feels like the vegetarian dishes were better than the meat-based ones, and there is plenty of vegetarian on offer. Wish they'd add samosas to the buffet. Overall I'd recommend it if you want Indian buffet but don't want/don't have time to leave campus, just avoid the chicken curry, especially if you're feeding kids or something.

<Content> I really wanted to like this place. Even though it's cramped and the crowd control is usually a disaster. Even though there are people milling around your table while you're trying to eat. But the nail in the coffin was the fact that I've gotten sick (digestive system upset) every single time I've been here. I love Indian food and I haven't had this problem at any of the other area restaurants. The nan tastes good but not good enough to spend a night in the bathroom.

<Content> I was first excited about a new Indian restaurant. However, after going here twice, I was pretty disappointed with the food and service here. There aren't many selections in the buffet. Also, many of the dishes are slightly bland and taste the same. I guess that is to be expected in a buffet. Also, the service here was horrendous to almost non-existent. If you want authentic Indian food, I suggest finding an alternative place.

<Content> Offensively bad. I have never had worse Indian food. The rice tasted gross and was not basmati. Everything else was flavorless and not recognizable as Indian food. The naan was stale. My boyfriend and I went for the buffet today and left after fifteen minutes, unable to find something remotely good. I've had better and fresher tasting Indian food from the Whole Foods food bar or from a box. If you want delicious authentic Indian food that go to Bombay or Curry House. Avoid this place at all costs.

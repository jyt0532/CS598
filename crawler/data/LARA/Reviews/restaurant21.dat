<Content> If you like super, super sweet pizza sauce then this is the place for you. It is way too sweet for my tastes.I had been waiting for this place to open. I ordered a take out individual Delight pizza and I had a 10% off coupon. If you go to their website and sign up for their rewards program you get the coupon. The pizza was a thin crust and had plenty of ingeidients on it. I liked the crust and the fresh mushrooms. The sausage had a good flavor too but I just can't get past the sauce. Unfortunately it is not my thing. I think if you love sweet sauces then you will love this pizza.They serve wine and beer too but they also do not have any outside seating. Another negative in my book. If I go back for some reason I would order something other than the pizza. But that is just me.

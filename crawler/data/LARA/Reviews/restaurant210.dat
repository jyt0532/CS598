<Content> It is one of the nicest looking McDonald's I have gone to. They are able to handle masses of customers smoothly. The best part is that it is open 24 hours. Their fries are always hot.

<Content> Messed up my order 3/4 times I've been there. I've never, ever, had an order messed up from McDonalds until this location(I'm 21, and I've been eating there a long time).I ordered a McChicken, McDouble got 2 McChickens. Ordered a black coffee, got 2 extra cream and sugar added for no reason. Ordered a Bacon Haberno Quarter Pounder, got a regular one instead.I mean, how does that happen. It's McDonalds, and in case you think I suck at ordering, the receipt had my correct order at least the first time because it was 2.69(McDouble's 1.30 or something)

<Content> Service is kind of rude, the mobile app specials they advertise everywhere are only available weird hours (they're invalid noon to midnight), drink/ketchup dispensers are sometimes down/empty, and to top it off I saw bugs crawling around on the tables on two separate occasions (a fly once, a ladybug another time). The food itself is fine. It's still McDonalds, cheap and open all day and all night, but they really need to step up their game maintaining this place.

<Content> As far as I know, this is the only food place open 24 hours on Green St. Pretty fast considering how busy they get on weekend nights. Aside from that they're like any other McDonald's.

<Content> What people have been waiting for: a 24-hour McDonalds on Green St. This is now open (in place of the old GameStop) as of Fall 2014. The new haven of late night drunk college students, this is a little above your typical McDonalds. Being a new facility, much of it is very nice and clean. It may not stay that way, but as of now it's very nice. The store is also well run in my experience and even late at night when it gets busy, they seem to stay on top of things. You may not want to, but you know you'll end up here eventually.

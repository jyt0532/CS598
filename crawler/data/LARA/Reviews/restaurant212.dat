<Content> The menu is pretty small. Only has pulled pork, sausage, and chicken meals.I got the pulled pork sandwich with no toppings and it was good, but for $6 it was not enough food (doesn't come with a drink or a side, only a piece of pickle and 2 of the smallest cornbread muffins I've ever seen). The guy said he would bring out my piece of pickle after he fried them up but he forgot until I reminded him.If you really like pulled pork, I recommend this place. If you're not a huge fan, I think there are better and more affordable options nearby.

<Content> Ok I ordered the "Nacho's" which consists of French fries, topped with pulled pork, topped with cheese sauce, topped with mild bbq sauce. I'm gonna make this short, sweet and to the point.It's nasty! The pulled pork was burned and dry as hell! (of course when I think of pulled pork I think of Hickory River, which is a pretty high standard) Just an all around disappointment! :(I guess if you're on campus and your tired of the usual suspects (subs, burgers and pizza) and you don't particularly care about quality bbq, then this is the spot for you. I won't be going back! blah!

<Content> This place is alright. I've ordered sushi, udon, and takoyaki from here. It's a bit pricey, but not very remarkable. This is one of those trendy Asian food places that pop up here and there, but they might be pushed out of business with places like Sakanaya or Sushi Kame. Sushi Rock has a nice, clean environment with hip decorations and a kpop/jpop mix going on in the background.The sushi is alright, but nothing really special. It's better than Sushi Ichiban no doubt, but compared to other sushi joints, the price isn't worth it. The udon is nice and the broth is warming, so I would recommend that. Mine came with vegetable and shrimp tempura, which were delicious! My only complaint with dining in is that the service, while friendly, can be a bit forgetful and you have to remind them you need water or your bill so they know you're there.The takoyaki was awful and a total ripoff though. I was picking up a snack between classes and paid a little over $4 for four lukewarm, shriveled up ping pong balls covered in sauce and a little bit of green onion. They were soggy and the little octopus bit was chewy like a wad of gum and tasted bland. I'm pretty sure they're the frozen kind you buy at Asian markets and you can buy a large bag to microwave at home for a better price.Of course, it's conveniently located on Green Street so it's close to campus and convenient for hungry students who would rather forego the even more overpriced and poor quality of Sushi San in the Union basement.

<Content> The Good: The wait staff is friendly. The bad: -The fish is butchered. It's not high quality and it's just treated very poorly. -The soy sauce dispensers were stuck to the tables and dirty! -The rice is so sticky (or this could be the fault of the plates) that we had to pry the rolls and nigiri off of the plates. -It was expensive. Significantly more expensive than its value. $14.99 for a rainbow roll would be steep if it were a good rainbow roll. Overall, I would never return here. I've gotten better quality and prices with delivery sushi.

<Content> This is your average sushi place. Sushi rolls can go anywhere from $4 to $9 and they're of fairly average quality. I ended up getting a lunch special with two rolls of sushi with miso soup. The pre-made miso soup is poured into a bowl, and then they take tofu squares from some sort of refrigerator and drop them into the soup; I found that odd. The service was pretty friendly too.The bento boxes can be underwhelming at times. For instance, I ordered a bulgogi bento box and I got more onions than bulgogi in it.

<Content> I liked it. I don't think I would order takeout from here again but dining in is fine. It's not a luxurious sushi place, but you knew that. The rolls and udon are yummy. I didn't get the "bad sushi taste" that accompanies the food at some other places, but I also haven't tried their nigiri for a full, uncluttered tasting. I'd go back. Their lunch specials are a nice deal.

<Content> I consider Sushi Rock as my go to place for sushi on campus. Its got nice decor and attentive wait staff. The rolls are expensive, but ordering 3 and splitting it two ways usually fills me. It isn't really a japanese restaurant though, as can be seen by the massive amount of korean items on the menu. That said, I'd recommend this place over Sushi Ichiban, which I consider to be a blight on the local food scene.

<Content> I went to this place with 2 Sushi Ichiban loyals. The first few things that really catch your attention are the slick decor (which makes Ichiban look like a hospital waiting room) and the bar located in the center of the restaurant stoked with Japanese beers and sodas (Ramune!!!). This place blows Ichiban out of the water in terms of service, sushi selection and aesthetics. The only drawback, in my mind, is that they serve tea in bags as oppose to a more traditional loose leaf variety.Bottom line: if you want sushi, come here. If you want a ton of chicken teriyaki for cheap and don't care about the crap service/experience at Ichiban, go there.

<Content> My friends rave about this place all the time. The first week of school my friends and I gathered here to have a nice dinner. The atmosphere was pretty nice and it wasn't too busy.Sushi Rock is on a great location on Green Street near the bars and other ethnic restaurants. However, I found the sushi very disappointing. Sushi Rock was wayyy too americanized with the crunchy fried food and the limited menu. The menu consist of some of the usual Japanese dish such as rolls, gyoza, and udon, but c'mon... no sashimi and no nigiri sushi?!? What kind of Japanese Restaurant does not sell nigiri and sashimi? Sashimi is a Japanese delicacy, and California Rolls and Crunch rolls are so not Japanese cuisine. It's like saying taco bell is authentic Mexican food, sorry. =/I really wanted to like you, Sushi Rock, but it wasn't working out. I felt like I wasn't eating real sushi even though the presentation of each dish was pretty eye-appealing. The taste wasn't right. Maybe because I'm eating raw "fish" in the Midwest, but I've been to a couple of good sushi restaurants in the Midwest and sushi rock did not cut it for me.Also, our server seemed very forgetful and clueless. She took forever to pick up our checks and close our checks when the restaurant was not busy at all. Maybe she was a new server but I'll give her a star for being nice. Overall, I enjoyed my time with my friends but I did not enjoy the food.

<Content> Well, we tried to come here. Yelp said they were open. We drove there, and it was closed. They have new summer hours. I forget what they are though.Anyways, call to see if it's open before you go.I guess we'll try it next time.I'm intrigued by the menu, some of the rolls sound like stuff I can't find anywhere else (if you know a place, let me know!)! The lava roll sounds great, so does the cali crunch. Can't wait to try it.

<Content> Sushi Rock just opened yesterday, and I wanted to love it. It's just...for now, okay. The servers are friendly and are trying really hard, but my tempura udon was only okay. The soup was a bit lukewarm and the tempura was a little uneven. In all fairness, they're trying and they're working out some of the kinks in the system, I'm sure, but I was a little underwhelmed. Still, I feel this is a bit more of a Midwestern attempt at what sushi is *supposed* to be like....I might give you another try, but you were entirely medium in my book, Sushi Rock.

<Content> This restaurant just opened yesterday and is owned by the people who run Green Onion (Korean Grocery store on Neil). The place has a modern feel with a pretty good layout but they seemed to be lacking in decorations, probably because they just opened. The menu for lunch is pretty basic and has your usual dragon rolls, spicy tuna and california rolls, along with some interesting twists like the "911 roll" (spicy spicy tuna), Mango roll and Sunset roll (All moderately priced). I went with a bunch of people and we all got the Udon + Spicy Tuna + California roll lunch special, for a cheap price of $8!! California rolls were surprisingly yummy with some tempura crunches on it along with some sweet sauce, and the spicy tunas weren't bad either. Udon was pretty good too, though it's still your basic udon. I didn't try their bento boxes, but they seemed to give you a decent amount for the price. I'll probably try that the next time I come.If you're going to go for lunch, try to order before 12 because that's when it starts to get busy and your orders will take a lot longer to come in.Overall the place is not bad. Not your best place, but not bad. If you're looking for a fairly cheap, simple japanese meal for lunch on Green Street, this place would be a good choice.PS. The also have some Korean dishes in the menu which I haven't seen or tried but I'd guess they weren't too bad since they own a Korean grocery store as well.

<Content> Came here to have lunch with a few friends. They are kinda pricey, but their lunch deals are definitely worth it! You can mix and match different items, including bento boxes, noodle soups, sushi, teriyaki, etc. I payed about $10 and my meal came with a large bowl of udon noodle soup and a side of 4 pieces of spicy tuna sushi and 4 more pieces of California roll. I left feeling full and satisfied!

<Content> In my two weeks in Champaign, I have been here twice and am dreaming about my third visit. Why? For their beef udon. I swear, since I haven't found a good pho place, this is the best alternative ever. On a whim I ordered it, and found myself faced with a monster bowl of delicious broth, silky beef, cabbage, and a mound of cooked-just-right noodles. Toss in some tofu or something, and it'd be yummmy sukiyaki.My friends (after I left my happy udon haze) informed me that the seaweed salad, spicy tuna roll, and chicken teriyaki were pretty good.

<Content> Small, dark, crowded, meh.They're just trying too hard here, and it's just not working. My friend was in town so we decided to get some sushi. As we were closer to Sushi Rock than Sushi Avenue, we thought, "what the hell, we're too lazy to walk back down Green".With the space being as small as it is, having a waitress bustling up and down the narrow aisles, hovering over your table waiting to take your order and/or refill your water was just annoying. And the super dim lighting I guess is their attempt at creating a romantic ambiance? But the fact you're sitting right on top of the brightly lit kitchen and/or right next to the constantly opening/closing front door makes it aggravating more than anything.$10 for a spider roll? Gimme a break. I can get two rolls, and a bowl of miso soup from Sushi Avenue for the same price! Plus, you don't have to tip at Sushi Avenue.So what does Sushi Rock have to offer that you can't get just a few blocks down Green at Sushi Avenue? Mmm... maybe the fact they serve alcohol? Even then.. meh.Don't get me wrong, the sushi here isn't bad, but it's nothing special either. I just prefer the hands-off approach of Sushi Avenue.

<Content> I've noticed that a lot of people are disappointed with SR so I should note that I ordered take out and did not dine in so my review is based on that (very good) experience. In short, I think Sushi Rock is great for those that love sushi that has a lot of raw fish in or on the roll. I was very impressed by how great Sushi Rock's sushi was. I ordered a rainbow roll and 2 other rolls that were similar (rolls with assorted raw fish on top) and I was shocked at how great the rolls were. They were fresh, a little creamy inside--simply incredible. I feel like the prices here are slightly lower than Kofusion and they also have a wider selection of sushi rolls. Again, as someone who loves the rainbow type rolls, Sushi Rock offers a lot of that variety at prices around $10-$13. They also have a very decently priced sashimi platter at just $10-11. That is CHEAP for any sushi place and I absolutely would have ordered this if I hadn't already had my eye on 3 other rolls. I'm not sure what their dine in service is like, but at least when I was getting take out, the hostess was great, offering me some tea, and when I declined ginger but mentioned I love wasabi, she made sure to give me extra wasabi at no additional cost. Also, some reviewers have questioned the restaurant for serving Korean food and not being authentic Japanese food. In short, sushi is not strictly Japanese fare and Sushi Rock is not trying to be a Japanese restaurant. *A lot* of sushi places are owned by Koreans and they really are a unique niche. One of my favorite dishes, hwe dup bap, is only served in Korean-owned sushi restaurants because it is specifically a Korean-sushi dish. So, don't expect authentic Japanese food here and don't be surprised by the Korean entrees. This is all part of the culture and cuisine of the place itself. CU has a lot of restaurants that are like this (in fact, I believe Sushi Kame is the ONLY Japanese-owned sushi place in town) so for those wondering, this is why you'll see a mix of ethnic cuisines.

<Content> Wow, I am really surprised by the reviews. The critics are right-- SR is not authentic Japanese, rather Korean. However, I don't feel the vague cultural distinction of the restaurant should detract from the quality food.FOOD:I usually get two items: 1) korokke and 2) sushi. I typically get the korroke, which is a japanese croquette. Living in northern Japan for 11 years, I can say that this korroke is EXACTLY like the korroke I've had in Japan (don't let the korokke websites fool you...the one I had in Japan had no meat in it). It's simply authentic and divine. The sushi is great, though I never get out of my comfort zone-- not because of taste but because of the price. Hey, I'm a college student with bills to pay, alright?SERVICE: I've dined in and have taken out and the service has been great. The people are friendly and warm If you are taking out and stay there while hey make your food, they offer you water, which is sweet! :)Overall, I have no complaints. I am a fan and will be dining there again!

<Content> I came here on one of my first days in Champaign, and I've been back several times since. The service has always been pretty good. I've only eaten there for lunch, and I like the deal with two rolls and a bowl of udon. To me, it's a lot of food for 8.99. I'm no sushi or udon expert, but I do think they taste really good, especially the udon. Nothing better than to slurp up the noodles on a cold winter's day. The main reason this place didn't get four stars was that I don't like the atmosphere. It's a little cramped. I don't like to feel like I'm sitting on top of my fellow diners. Also, they play Top 40 stuff, which isn't all that appealing to me. I guess they're going for a young feel, but I don't wanna hear that stuff all the time when I'm eating. I guess that makes me old and crotchety.

<Content> Sushi rock does not rock. I went for dinner and lunch and both times, it was overpriced for the portion and the quality. I love salmon so I got their sunrise roll and their salmon avocado roll. I barely finished half of what I ordered because it was just unappetizing. Their salmon was sort of tasteless... and I was really looking for that salmon-y flavor. Isn't anyone else outraged that they charge $0.99 for miso soup? When I went to sushi places this summer soup and salad were usually given for free. Actually, I can't recall a sushi place that ever charged for miso soup... One star for their cheeseballs.

<Content> My friends and I decided on this place after a long day of shopping. We were all in the mood for some good sushi and accidentally ran into this place. The food was awesome. My brother got the Kalbi and it was wonderful. The short ribs were cooked just right. I got the seaweed salad and they made it perfectly with the right amount of vinegar and sesame oil. The sushi was also great!The inside of the restuarant is dimly lit so those of you who need glasses to read, make sure you bring them. It is also set up to have this contemporary feel. However, the restaurant is a bit small but hey, its on Green St.Parking was a little difficult. If you can't find street parking, there is a lot you can park in across the street. However you do have to pay for it, except on weekends.

<Content> I went to this place wanting some close-by Japanese food and some sushi. I still don't understand why all sushi places in Campustown offer Korean food too. It seems a little funny to me... Anyways, to the review!The atmosphere at lunch time was busy but there was plenty of space available for a party of two. We were promptly served and the food came to us relatively quickly. I ordered the spicy tuna, california rolls, and udon noodle combo, and the veggie yakisoba (enough food for two hungry people). I was not too impressed with the sushi so I do think the better quality sushi can be found elsewhere. However, for the price and it being U of I campustown, I cannot complain. The sushi ingredients were fine but the wrapping job could have been better. I enjoyed the udon noodles which was warm when I received it. It had enough noodles but the best part was the broth. The yakisoba noodles were comparable to noodles that I have had elsewhere like Sushi Kame (but Kame still has better quality). The dish had a great selection of veggies and a proper ratio of noodles and sauce met my high expectations. I am glad that it is closer than some of the other alternatives like Sushi Avenue which may be a stretch for a one-hour lunch. I gave it a three out of five because of its distance relative to campus and the quality-to-price ratio. If you have more time and are interested in better dining at a higher price, consider some of the other Japanese restaurants in town.

<Content> Been there once to check it out (2 months ago?) and probably won't return due to location, quality and service.LOCATION: Campustown. The only places worth going are Jon's Pipeshop, Rentertainment, Bombay, New Life, Evo (sometimes), and Murphy's (rare, since I live closer to downtown Champaign).QUALITY: We had a few different types of sushi, and they were all greasy and most, if not all on the menu were fried or fusion-y. Overpriced for mediocre sushi, and I also found hair on my plate (not THAT big a deal if it hadn't happened right after my appalling service experience). Maybe their non-sushi entrees are better but I'm not willing to find out since I've been to other places I like more (Sushi Kame, Yellowfin and Kamakura).SERVICE: I actually don't like reviewing for service (too subjective and I've worked retail so I know what it's like) but this was too much. We were greeted by our server with "hey guys" (not very professional but given the location...), and when he saw the back of my head, switched to "hey guy and girl" (trying to be witty?). He didn't apologize when he realized he made a mistake (we're both female). I'll give the place credit that they switched servers (the 2nd one made an excuse that the 1st one suddenly became busy with other tables), but maybe only because they heard me say that I wasn't going to leave a tip.I did tip 20%--however, I probably won't ever go back.

<Content> Their sushi is good, however limited in selection. I really enjoy the dragon roll and that's about it. I have had their lunch boxes and they are ok, not particular better than Sarku Japan's and yet they are pricier.The atmosphere in this place is modern and hip and therefore the booths are rigid and painful to sit in. The chairs I believe are also without padding.Overall I would give it 3 1/2 but I can't take half of a star off.

<Content> We went for lunch one day last week, and we will probably try a lot of other sushi places in Champaign before we come back here.We had the veggie gyoza, and 2 vegetable sushi rolls. Yes, this review is based on a vegetarian meal! The gyoza were deep fried with almost no fililng, and while the cucumber avocado roll was par for the course, the "Vegi 911" roll was gross -- filled with a spicy pepper that added no flavor, only heat.Along with 2 cokes, that racked our bill up to $26.

<Content> Ive been here two times both times the place was not impressive. First time the sushi tasted bad and bland and they didnt fill my water up the whole time. The second time I ordered chicken teriyaki, I thought this would be a cant go wrong dish. Wrong, it had fillers in the chicken plate such as onions and carrots. The chicken didnt even taste like teriyaki. The bento boxes are reasonable but the food is subpar. I think you should stay away from this place because of bad food, subpar waitressing and expensive pricing for what you get. I hope they improve because the food is not great nor even appetizing.

<Content> Went here at 2:57 p.m. on a Saturday following Dad's Day football game. Green street sidewalks were packed with the crowd following a football game at which 60,000 people were present. First words out of our server's mouth were "You need to order right away because the kitchen closes at 3:00"Are you kidding me? On so many levels that was wrong. Stupid not to adjust kitchen hours to match circumstances, and stupid to greet us that way. Its not like we were going to linger long in this semi-fast-food campus restaurant before we ordered, but now we really felt rushed.The food is usually good, I've been there several times, but this time the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box was not great; the tempura veggies were a clump of greasy onions. The Miso soup is a good addition and the spicy tuna and California sushi rolls we also ordered were decent but nothing special.The advantage to this place was the speed and value, yet it was clear the waiter was in a hurry. He was pleasant, but brought the food out as soon as everything came ready despite the fact that we were still having our soup when he set the bento boxes on the table. An additional ten minutes might have been nice. And he delivered the check without us asking while we were still eating. There is a time and a place for that speed, like at an interstate truck stop.It gets three stars because of value, but it has a schizophrenic atmosphere. Is it trying to be a nice place or is it the McDonalds of Bento Boxes?

<Content> I got the sunset roll $8.99 (salmon and crab) and the tuna avocado roll (w/ spicy tuna) $7.50. Both were pretty good, each roll was 6 small pieces. The place is pretty trendy, all the servers and chefs were pretty young. I ordered it to go, so I can't really say how the waiter service was, but the bartender was nice and they made my sushi pretty quickly. For most of the places i've eaten around here, I rather like this place, since the prices are reasonable and the food was really good (and I eat sushi ALOT). I'll definitely be returning again.

<Content> If I could give this place 3 and a half stars, I would. Sushi Rock is one of two or three places on Green Street where you can find sushi; unfortunately, I've never been to the other ones so I can't tell you which one is better. However, the only reason I go to Sushi Rock over Sushi Kame is that the location is more convenient. Sushi Rock's menu has changed for the better since I've been here, but their sushi rolls are, while delicious, rather Americanized and very expensive. Be warned, sushi takeout is not great here; you're better off eating at the restaurant. Sushi Rock also offers other Japanese fare such as bento boxes, which are very much worth the money in terms of the amount of food you get (they also give you miso soup with it). The service here is quite good as the waiters are friendly and attentive. I've seen the owner come out and do sake bombs with the customers once in a while too.

<Content> This place was cool when it first opened. Very integrated staff, cheese ball appetizers was amazing (had a cream sauce and sprinkled green onions on top), but that doesn't happen any more. The rolls were served with wasabi mayo sauce but that is lacking these days as well. Sushi Rock has fell off considerably since its opening. Took my roommate here and actually felt bad about it when I discovered how everything had changed, and that was within a year or so.

<Content> The location is good, but the food is far from authentic Japanese food. The teriyaki sauce seems fake. Better choices for Japanese food in town would be Yellowfin or Kamakura. I thought the prices were too high for what you got. College kids might enjoy the large portions of food however.

<Content> For a place with Sushi in it's name, the sushi was disappointing. Rolls only, no nigiri, no sashimi, no custom orders. The noodle dishes were OK.

<Content> Although I like the food here and the atomosphere I doubt I will be coming back because of the service. The past two times I've been here I've had to wait much too long for your basic sushi rolls. This past time was the worst my friend and I both ordered two different rolls each, we both received one roll first after about a 25 minute wait and were told the others were coming. About 45 minutes later the server told us someone else has taken our rolls and that is why he had had to wait so long. We finally got our second rolls a few minutes later. As soon as we were done eating we got our checks and the minute we had paid the host came up to us and asked us if we could please leave because they needed the table...after making us wait over an hour for a basic California roll they have the nerve to kick us out the minute they get their money, we still had to pay full price for everything even after all that hassle. I won't be returning because there are a few other alternatives that are just as good close by.

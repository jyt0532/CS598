<Content> The best gyros I've had anywhere, which is saying something since I was born and raised in Europe, and live in Los Angeles. The meat isn't dried up and charred like I've hat at so many other places - it's fresh, juicy, and flavorful. No bland, thin pita or cucumber sauce here. The only downside is that there aren't any Zorba's in LA, because now I'm addicted.

<Content> After my horrendous experience with Niro's I was optimistic that Zorba's might have a better gyro.The store is right on Green street and impossible to miss walking by. Inside is pretty cool, open style kitchen and lots of indoor seating. The menu is on the counter where you order, which could be problematic if you are like me and take 5 minutes to look at a menu and there are people behind you!I decided on a 4oz gyro and mac and cheese bites. My name was taken and I was called when it was ready. Interestingly enough, you also pay right when your food is ready, which was different, but I liked it!I dashed home and unwrapped everything, anxious to try it. My gyro was actually pretty small and almost resembled a taco in size and shape. I did think that this gyro was really on point though. The meat was thicker, flavorful, not too greasy and of a good consistency. The tzatziki was really good, too! Kind of creamy but not too yogurt-y or watered down like some places. The mac and cheese bites were also surprisingly good. Usually these are just dry pieces of mush but on the inside they were warm, gooey and tasty! Overall I would definitely say the Zorba's has the best gyro in the CU area, but I still need to try more places.The only thing I did not like was the portion/price. My gyro was not very big, I probably could have ate 2-3 of them. However, quality over quantity any day of the week and this was one tasty gyro that would really give my suburban favorites a run for their money.I'll be back to try more!

<Content> 2.5 stars. I have a feeling that at some point in the 1970s this place was serving amazing family recipe homemade gyros and built some kind of mystique. Well, now it's clearly just Kronos fast food, and they misfire on all cylinders.The meat is barely roasted and heated through, it's supposed to be super charred. Cucumber sauce is just some yogurt. The pita isn't olive oil crispy, it's microwaved or something. You can get a sandwich like this anywhere in Chicago, prepared a lot better.Prices are good, portions are fine for the cost, flavor is substandard to most gyros I've had elsewhere. I'd still eat junk food here over Chipotle, which is fresher but a heartless corporation, but this place is a big disappointment considering the lore that comes with it. Find that old family recipe and get back to doing things the old fashioned way!

<Content> Yep, it lived up to the hype. Great gyro sandwiches with a cool local feel. The pita is soft and the gyro meat is some of the most tender I've found. Brilliantly seasoned too, the meat is definitely what sets these gyros apart. I also liked that there are multiple size options for the sandwiches. The place has a nice, local college hotspot feel. Not wild and crazy, but more the kind of place students stop by on their way to and from class.

<Content> Not a gyro expert but this was the most tender gyro I've ever had. Didn't know a gyro could achieve the melt in your mouth consistency. I usually am hungover when i eat gyros, but I was not hung over when I ate this. I almost want to binge drink so I can eat here the next day. Good stuff.

<Content> This is simply one of my favorite spots in town. They say that consistency is the hallmark of excellence. Well I've been stuffing my face with their delicious gyros and assorted fried side dishes since high school, and I've yet to eat one that wasn't just totally fulfilling and delicious. Actually, the hallmark of excellence is probably just making really fantastic gyros, which is a thing that Zorba's is all about. The staff is always friendly, and even at their busiest you're going to get your order quickly.My go to order has generally been the large chicken, however you can't go wrong with the classic. You can take either and pick a size to fit your small-large appetite, and then customize it from there, which is a little different, and better, than most other gyro joints I've visited. I also prefer subbing in onion rings or fried mushrooms for fries.The location is a little small, so it can get packed during the lunch hour, but even so there is usually a table open, or you can easily get your meal to go.If you find yourself on campus and don't check this place out, you're doing yourself an enormous disservice.

<Content> They sell their gyros in 4 sizes: 2 oz, 4 oz, 6 oz, and 8 oz. This is pretty neat as a large or medium gyro should be enough to suffice a hungry person. However, I have to say that their gyro meat isn't as succulent as I thought it'd be. The Greek salad wasn't anything special either. I gotta say that I prefer Niro's Gyros more.

<Content> Came to Zorba's on the suggestion by a cousin who has, and I quote, "never given a bad food recommendation".And it was another hit! Chicken gyros and fried mushrooms for dinner hit the spot. At other Greek spots, I'm used to having a humongous foil wrapped hunk of a mess of gyro served to me that I inevitably finish... and end up feeling like a blob because I didn't want to waste food. But Zorba's is here to help you with portion control! I like how they offer their gyros in 4 different sizes. Oh, and try the cucumber sauce. You know you're in for a treat when it takes 9.8 seconds for the grease in your meal to seep through the bottom of the paper bag.

<Content> My favorite restaurant right around the university. Phenomenal gyros. I'd say I still hold Zorba's as the golden standard of gyros. I was there every Tuesday in college for Groovy Tuesday - $1 off gyros - and i was probably there at least one other meal each week. Quick, cheap, delicious. Can't get better than that.I have a gyro or two every time I'm back in Champaign. Everyone should eat more Zorba's!!

<Content> Great restaurant! Being that I was hanging out in Everitt for most of my stay in Chambana - I got very familiar with Zorba's!What to say about it... Service is always great. The people that work there always seem happy and treat you well. Prices are totally reasonable. I went almost every Tuesday as it was cheaper on Tuesday. Their gyros are great - though if you get a normal gyro you will be left smelling, well, like a gyro. The chicken gyro never had that effect for whatever reason. So good.I went almost every Tuesday and I'd get a large normal gyro with a side of fries. I'd bring a textbook and study for an hour or two while enjoying my amazing food. Great place to study ( at least for me) as there was always enough noise to keep my mind from wandering - but little enough noise so that I could concentrate.Never eat here before a test. You'll go into a food coma and not do well on your test. I learned this the hard way. The very, very hard way.

<Content> I only went to Zorba's a couple times before it closed, and I remember being disappointed with it because I could get much better gyros back home. I had given up on gyros on campus (until I went to niro's but that's another review) but I was willing to give Zorba's another chance when it reopened. Many of my friends thought I was crazy for preferring niro's, so maybe I just remembered wrong?Well, it was pretty much the same as I remembered. The meat is mediocre, and I feel like you definitely get more for your money at niro's. I do like that they have different sizes so you don't have to get a giant gyro if you're not particularly hungry.Had I rated Zorba's before coming back, I would have given them four stars. The food isn't bad; I've just had better. But my favorite part of a gyro is the cucumber sauce, and it just wasn't right here. Correct me if I'm mistaken, but isn't it supposed to be thick, white, and yogurty? And nice and cold so you get that contrast between the cold sauce and the warm gyro meat? Well, the sauce here was runny, warm, and almost clear. I don't know, maybe something was just weird when I went, but with Niro's in my backyard (where I know they have the right sauce) and graduation in a month, I doubt I'll be back.

<Content> One of the regular spots on Green street, every time I make the painful decision not to eat at Antonio's and instead eat here, I'm a little surprised as how much I like Zorba's. I see a review saying Niro's is better and cheaper - Zorba's isn't that expensive - but I've never been to Niro's, so I can't compare. I will say that Zorba's has great fries - crinkle cut. Not much else to say - it's standard gyro stuff, for a pretty reasonable price (huge portion, fries and drink for like $7), and it's definitely one of the few places on that first block of Green that hasn't changes in I think 35+ years.

<Content> Currently closed due a fire above them. :( I always look forward to eating here and was so sad when I came home in May and couldn't have any. I wish them a speedy recovery. I'll be back for the holidays and hope they have re-opened by then.My parents used to come here when they were dating back in the day. They started taking me and my brother as kids. The whole family enjoy the food. It's the only place my dad will eat fries. I, on the other hand, love fries, and while their fries are good, they aren't THAT good.  The gyros on the other hand are! We get the lamb ones. It's always a tough decision trying to figure out what size to get- sometimes your eyes are bigger than your stomach. The food is consistent good and served quickly. And I love the Illini memorabilia. Hopefully, they will still have some to post when they re-open.Parking is an issue as they have no dedicated lot. The best plan for when school is in session (if you don't live on campus) is to drop off someone, let the other person circle around to find parking, and take it with you. Otherwise, be very patient with finding parking- especially during lunch time.

<Content> I am going to be the dissenting voice on this place, but I don't think it isn very good. Everything it does, Niro's Gyros does both better and cheaper. I honestly think Zorba's has kind of a privileged place due to nostalgia - it is an institution and one of the few places on Green Street that hasn't changed in the last decade (and beyond).So maybe I am not the target audience. But the thing is, I love gyros! They're greasy enough that I don't get them too often, but I do love them. This brings us to the main problem: Zorba's gyros are not very good. I have been used to the gyros in my hometown (gigantic), the ones in Naperville (huge), and the ones from Niro's (also huge). The ones at Zorba's are comparatively small. This is not a deal-breaker - I don't need the mountains of meat all the time. The problem is that the meat is not very good. It has kind of a gritty texture and an off flavor. It reminds me of the frozen gyro meat you can get at grocery stores. They offer an array of sauces, but the tzatziki is key and it's not very good either. I see rave reviews of the fries, and while they are good, they aren't exceptional. Even on a discount day, the fry and gyro meal is more than other places in town and I just did not like it as much. I thought the first time might've been an unfair representation, but on the next visit I could not finish the gyro - the texture of the meat got to me. Decor is old-fashioned as fits a local institution. There is sort of a grease-haze that hangs in the air.

The fact that you can order a small, medium. or large gyro and customize it however you want make it good for any size appetite.

<Content> Hands down the most underrated place on campus. Everything they offer is at least good, while their gyros are nothing short of amazing (for Chambana, at least). The jazz shows are a nice touch, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff is always friendly. One of my favorite places to spend a break, whether it's between classes or during work.It doesn't offer enough food on the level of their gyros to warrant a five-star rating, but it deserves a strong four.

The only "problem" is that you'll smell like gyro, onion, and grease when you leave.

<Content> I usually eat healthy, well-balanced meals. However, I occasionally indulge with something less health-friendly. When I indulge, I go to Zorba's. I order an enormous gyro with mountains of onion, tomato, cucumber sauce, and feta cheese. A Zorba's gyro is heaven for the tastebuds. Unfortunately, I usually get massive amounts of heartburn after eating at Zorba's, but it's totally worth it.I've been told that Zorba's has live music some nights, but I've never actually seen it.

<Content> I think it says something that my friend has searched far and wide throughout all of Chicago and failed at finding another gyro place as good as Zorba's in Champaign.Throughout my 4.5 years in Chambana, never once did I have a less than spectacular meal here. Both their chicken and original (I believe it is a mix between beef and lamb) gyros are mouth-watering. I was afraid that the lamb would have that weird gamey taste, but it only made for a more complex flavor, which I totally didn't expect. They have a great selection of sauces that I am guilty of drowning my gyros in. Their fries are made to order and come out piping hot and are even more delectable with a dipping sauce concoction of my own (made by combining their honey mustard and cucumber sauces - must try). What I found surprising is that no one knew about their unlimited and FREE toppings list. You can get a whole assortment of other toppings on your gyro all at no charge!Two years ago, they started catering to the drunk, after-bars crowd on Fridays and Saturdays. However, those gyros are a fraction of the size and a fraction of the goodness of their regular ones. So I'd stick to One World to fulfill that drunken craving if I were you...*Also, I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but I always come out of the restaurant smelling like I've dipped myself in frying oil. I'm thinking that their made to order fries has something to do with it.

<Content> Welcome back Zorbas! Green Street didn't feel the same without you since you burned down.Zorba's new space is much more roomy with the cashier on the right and near the back, directly opposite from where it was located before. Although the ambiance is much improved, my gyro lacked taste. Sure it had all of the fixings without me asking: yogurt sauce, cucumber, tomato, onion...but the meat was bland.My expectations for food quality are high even though this restaurant is located in the midst of collegiate-drunken-food-ville where food in this area is generally bland.

<Content> This was my favorite place to get Gyros in town. Despite the heated debate over who had the best gyros (Zorba's vs. Niro's Gyros), I always sided with Zorba's, the 'fixins' added to the gyro (tomato, onions and whatever else you wanted) were always fresh and great quality, something that NIro's seemed to lack on more than one occasion.Zorba's had daily specials (like Groovy Tuesdays: one dollar off classic gyro meals) which kept me coming back every Tuesday I attended classes at the University of Illinois. However, on Wednesday March 23, 2011 Zorba's was affected by the fire that started in the apartments above the business. As of now, I don't know when, if ever they'll re-open their shop on Green St. But here's to hoping!

<Content> Ah Zorba's, makes me feel young again. I frequented this place all the time when I was a student at UofI. YUM their gyros are some of the best. I like that they have different sizes of gyros. Definitely get the fried mushrooms, you won't be disapointed. Pass on the spinach pie though, it's not very good. They aren't the cheapest if you're a poor student, it can add up if you get fries and mushrooms and everything. Cheap beers. They used to have free jazz on Tuesdays, I think, not sure if they still do.YUM their cucumber sauce is awesome. They also have a wonderful honey dijon for the chicken gyros. My bf sometimes has to go down to UofI for career fairs, I always make him to go Zorbas and get me a gyro with extra cucumber sauce. I will eat it 3 hours later and cold, and it's still delicious.They call out your name when your order is ready, my friends and I would give them funny names like Shaft and one time I was Captain, and my friend was Tennille, but they called Tennille first, that blew.

Zorba's has spits of chicken and lamb, as well as sauces to complement them. I've been happy with both kinds of gyros. Now, I only wish there were a Zorba's in my college town.

<Content> It's pretty good. Nothing too special; I normally get the grilled chicken sandwich, which has been dry a few too many times for my taste. It's also a bit expensive compared to some of the other Campustown locations, but a nice change of pace every once in a while. I'm never unhappy at Zorba's. I will say that I wish the place hadn't caught fire- the memorabilia collection they have is nice, and I would have loved to see the old one.

<Content> Zorba's is still my favorite gyro place of all time. The food is delicious and they have some pretty unique sauces. The meat is always tender and flavorful, never dry or bland. Definitely check out the Groovy Tuesday deal = $1 off original gyros (lamb + beef mix) and half off fries. The fries are the best I've ever had--crispy yet not too skinny, and always piping hot. Check them out! I always stop by for a bite when I'm back in town.

<Content> I was trying to think of places I would miss when I finish my Master's program here in Champaign-Urbana and the top three are Murphy's, Canopy Club and Zorba's. I've always been a fan of gyros and I have to say that these are right up there with the ones I get in Chicago. In fact, Zorba's is better than some of the gyros I've gotten in Chicago before. This is my favorite place to eat on Green Street. Besides Antonio's, it's probably the only one that not a chain and I unequivocally love the Large Gyro combo plain with a Cherry Pepsi.

<Content> Fine times i have had here the fries sometimes are subpar and thats why three stars because how can you mess up frozen fries but they manage to so maybe take a look at your product or prep, gyros taste great to me.

<Content> Cool place for lunch on campus... It's right next door to Za's, where I've going a bit too often, so I'm glad I finally gave it a try. They're specialty is gyros sandwiches (on pita bread): pick your meat (lamb or chicken), size (small, medium, large), and sides (get the combo which comes with fries and a drink). I tried the chicken, and it was good, although I wish the meat had been a little more grilled (it wasn't crispy at all). Their fries are great! They also have a few other things on the menu (regular sandwiches etc), and they're open late most nights. I'll be back for sure.

<Content> Back in the day, this is the place where I would go on campus if I wanted "ethnic" food. Yes, having a gyro is ethnic enough when your main options are otherwise pizza and burgers. Still, even after my exposure to other places, I still had my Zorba's craving. They were one of the few places I found that served chicken gyros with shaved chicken as opposed to chunks. I also ordered fries and, as they always have, they freshly fried them up for my order.

<Content> This past weekend, my bf and I did a quick trip to Champaign, because we just needed to get out of Chicago for a couple of days. When we parked our car and walked down Green St., there were a whole bunch of NEW restaurants compared to when I went to college years ago. One familiar restaurant was Zorba's. Got two med. gyros, fries, and drinks to go. When we sat outside on the quad, we upwrapped a tightly rolled gyro. So eating it outside on a windy day was not a problem at all! Really good and the pita seemed fresh and light, not super greasy like the joints here in Chicago. Don't think I'll go back to Champaign for a long time, but it's a great lunch/dinner option.

<Content> Based solely on their gyros: 5 stars. Absolutely delicious. Not too much sauce, succulent meat, crisp onions, tomatoes, all on fluffy, chewa pita bread. I am wowed by the fact that you can choose your size of gyro. I think a medium gyro (4oz) is perfect for filling you up without overwhelming your stomach. AND, it's under $5. Yum, yum, yum.

<Content> This is where I spend 20 minutes every Tuesday night. Good gyros, cucumber sauce, etc., and thanks to Groovy Tuesdays you can get a kickass feta (+hummus, if you like) veggie pita for a little over $2. Service is fast and it's not usually too crowded. Nice, tall tables too.

<Content> Gyros, tzatziki, fries, and friendly cooks and cashiers make this place a must-go. My parents graduated from the U of I in 1981, and Zorba's was there back then! Considering the relatively high turnover rate of Campustown restaurants, I think that's pretty impressive.

<Content> I can't believe I walked past this place for three years. What is more sad is that many of those times were likely while I walked into Subway across the street on a Tuesday afternoon to drop $5 on a Veggie Delight. Little did I know I could get a delicious, warm, and fresh vegetable hummus pita across the street for a little over a dollar. At least I have many more Tuesdays ahead to take advantage!

The food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. On top of it, the atmosphere gives you a feel to what our culture at U of I is like. Pass up the chains and go to Zorba's. Take it from an ILLINI - you won't be disappointed.

<Content> One word. Disappointed.Good looking interior, and even had some of the old tables from the original Zorbas.I ordered my food and waited to pay. The cashier left to take orders, and the line started backing up. The fifteen minute wait time would be forgivable if the fries weren't old, overcooked, and the portions of meat, small. There was literally 30-40 people crammed into this place ordering food and still got bad french fries...Green St. never really had good quality food, but there is a disturbing trend of places like Beef Stand and Sliders charging EXPENSIVE prices for college students and making subpar food.  Nero's on university charges about the same price for what I got, and their fries are fresh and hot, give you huge portions on gyro meat and have it cooked well. The only thing I paid for was the convenience of eating on Green St. As a college student, and someone who works summers and breaks to pay for food during the year, I'm looking for a DEAL or at the very least, willing to pay the price for good food. All I got was something overpriced and meh.

<Content> I am incredibly sad that I did not discover this place until my fourth semester at the University of Illinois. I made something of a ritual out of going there every Tuesday for their reduced vegee gyros and fries, and always left satisfied. They have incredibly fast service, the place is always clean, and I *love* all the sauce choices! The salad always came fresh and crisp with the dressing automatically on the side, which was great too. I think the world could definitely use more Zorba's locations..until then, I'll have to make sure to swing by every time I head back to the U-C.

<Content> Mmmm... gyro. I know that Zorba's isn't authentic Greek food-- I go to Chicago for that, but for what it is, it's excellent. The service is always very friendly and speedy, and they have a fairly large menu and is inexpensive. They also have Killians on tap and a fairly large bottle selection. Zorba's is probably my favorite green street eatery.

<Content> I never was really bold enough to try gyros until I landed in Chambana and was told Zorbas was worth a go. I do like their classic gyro and the price is good and it always goes well with the crinkle fries. The location is great for students on campus but often you need to work around the busy lunch hour or wait until summer when all the undergrads are gone. Watching the sports on television or listening to jazz on Thursday is also a draw in case you decide to come alone for lunch/dinner.

<Content> Restaurant reviewI am glad that I am back by Za's after moving back to Champaign. This was my favorite place to eat at on campus when I was a medical student. Now that I am back I have found out that there are multiple locations which works out well. The prices are actually cheaper than when I was here for college due to a modification in the menu. For the pasta you get to select from multiple types and sauces with 4 toppings for 5 dollars. The premium protein items i.e shrimp, meatballs, chicken will run you a dollar more each. The food is prepared quickly, however I don't know if they changed it now to use a convection oven/microwave to nuke your toppings which is one down side. This is then added to a pan with the sauce and served quickly. You also get a nice piece of garlic bread. All and all this is better than McD and for the same price. There are also other options such as pizza, salads, sandwiches etc. I have never strayed from the pastaPro: inexpensive, quick, large portionsCons: microwaved toppings (i guess you get what you pay for)Hidden gem:Sign up for the perka app. You need to check in and tell the cashier so they can give you the punch to earn free food. I did not realize this and ended up not getting my first check-in. You can't just check-in which makes sense or people would abuse the system

<Content> Eh this place is really a hit or miss. The first time I came I got a panini and it was pretty good. I got 4 toppings yet there was still barely anything on the bread. They were extremely skimpy on the toppings. My friends who got the pasta and pizza were very happy though. The second time I got a Caesar salad and tomato basil soup. Pretty simple order. My Caesar salad was incredibly soggy yet didn't really taste like anything. It tasted like they watered down their dressing..? My soup came lukewarm and wasn't anything special. This place is alright but really nothing special.

<Content> Ugh, what happened to Mia Za's? It used to be a great place to go to for a quick, customized lunch. Now the pasta is obviously frozen, portions are small, Alfredo sauce almost flaky. The amount of meat they give you is lackluster and the salad dressing is weirdly fake-tasting. Some pros are: big and roomy. Convenient location. Very customizable. I used to go often. Now I go never. Even with their price tag, it's not worth it. If you want cheap, quick food, do Chinese. Do McDonalds.

<Content> Went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Walking into the restaurant is information overload - flashing signs with complicated juice ordering methods (I'll have 3-F?) and a menu with hundreds of lines of text. The entire process of ordering is time consuming and a bit confusing, in my opinion. The food itself is pretty unappetizing. I ordered the "Asian" menu item which was rotini noodles doused in a prepackaged ginger sauce. I added "grilled" chicken that was obviously anything but grilled; if I would have to guess I would say boiled. It also came with a cold and soggy piece of overly buttered garlic bread. I really love eating food and always finish my plate but this time I left half of the dish.I'm leaving a 2 star rating because I think 1 star is reserved for when something horrible happens. However, I will not likely ever eat at this restaurant again.

<Content> Besides my own personal anxiety at places where I have to fill out a paper about what I want to eat I am glad I picked Mia Za's for lunch. $5 Whole Wheat Wednesdays (pizzas or paninis) I ordered a whole wheat margherita pizza upon the recommendation of a co-worker. Normally stay away from margherita pizzas because they can be very bland. This one was not it was bursting with flavor! It was so good. Writing this review makes me want another one. The smoothies are also very tasty.

<Content> As an alumnus of the University of Illinois, I often get a little teary-eyed when I visit the campus and think of both good and bad experiences I encountered there when I was a student in the mid-1960s.I also got teary-eyed with joy when I saw Mia Za listed under the local chamber of commerce's list of "Dining on a Dime" restaurants near the campus. i.e., I assumed it was cheap (and it was).My youthful bride of 34 years (Mrs. B) and I were checking out the restaurants in the Campus town area just northwest of the Alma Mater statue. While looking at the bill of fare at this establishment, the owner came out and gave us a sales pitch for having our dinner there.This is a very small "hole in the wall" place that probably seats no more than 20 diners. Tables are on the first floor and also on a second floor.The gimmick here is that you are provided with a ballot-like menu to order your food. We both decided to order a pasta meal. So, we filled out a paper form that allows you to select the type of noodles, sauce, toppings, and other items you want to eat. Then you hand the form to the counter attendant, and they call you when your meal is ready: usually in less than ten minutes.The same procedure is used to choose salads, paninis, and pizza.We were there at about 5:45 on a Monday during the summer session, so the place was not busy. But given the lack of space at Mia Za, it could look like Groucho's stateroom in "A Night at the Opera" during the fall and spring semesters.

<Content> This place is okay only if you're really hungry between classes and don't have a lot of time to eat. However it's way too overpriced and they barely give you any food. I wouldn't eat here if I was able to just go home and make the food myself since they basically give you crappier versions of food you can make at home.

<Content> I've been here a couple of times, and the food is tasty, but the portions are small. It's by no means expensive, but I feel like you get less pizza, for example, than you should for the price.There are tables and a few booths upstairs, big enough to hold about 6 people each, so it's good to go with a small group of friends. If you want Italian food that isn't too fancy and close to the quad, this is a pretty good choice.

<Content> This place is a favorite among U of I students! I came here for the first time yeeears ago on my violin teacher's recommendation (she is a U of I graduate and had many fond memories of the place). I have been here several times since; I always try to stop by when I'm in the neighborhood. Za's has an excellent location near campus and a lot of other restaurants, apparel shops, ice cream/froyo places, etc. Eating here can be a bit overwhelming at first because there are SO many options! You fill out a sheet of paper to describe exactly what you want with options from salads, paninis, soups, pizzas, smoothies, and more. The big selling point of Za's is that you can customize your order to exactly how you want it with any toppings, sauces, or flavors--any way you want it! After ordering, you scoot on over to the pick-up counter and wait for your food to be ready. There are tables both upstairs and downstairs, so don't fret if every table is taken on the first floor. The stairs are kind of steep, so be careful as you walk up there with your food! I usually order the "pick two" option. My favorite is the broccoli cheddar soup with the "lite panini," which can be customized exactly how you want it. The broccoli cheddar here is one of my favorites and has grated cheddar cheese on top. Yum. The food is by no means mind-blowing. Overall, this is your standard Italian lunch food with a few very above average options, like the soup. I also highly recommend trying the smoothies here (my drink of choice is the mango). They use real fruit and fruit juice!Honestly, if you're in the area, you really can't miss a stop at Za's. Note: I last ate here before it burned down, so I can't speak to the quality of the original's replacement.

<Content> A word to the wise, don't get their salads. 2/2 on the times I have ordered salads, I got that green squishy stuff that you typically reject when making your own salads at home. Throwing vegetables (and sometimes fruit) in a bowl doesn't constitute a salad, folks. The pizza and pasta are ok though.I am still giving it 3 stars because they have a good selection of iced tea and the extraordinarily eclectic ambiance. There is wall art of unique silhouettes like a cat dangling from a power line and a ninja on a bike upstairs which are modestly entertaining. But there is also a great little function where you can text in a song request and a monitor will play the song and video.My choice?Birthday Song - 2 Chainz ft. Kanye West.3 stars.

<Content> Za's is average, and it fascinates me as it's basically a pseudo-Italian factory of food. The server could barely hide her snarl when I asked a question, but that's because they were serving about 3,000 people at once. Honestly, it felt like Henry Ford was making a Model T-ortelini.I do like that you can customize salads and sandwiches and pasta--and that lemon cream sauce is DELICIOUS.However, it has all the personality of a computer science grad student, and the old-style Italian movie poster lend very little charm.Yet I know I'm going to be hungry at some point in the middle of the day and forget to bring my lunch.And then Henry Ford's Italian Motor Cafe will be there for me.

<Content> Za's took me back to the days of Radical Rye in Madison, WI. Yes, one is a pizza/toasted sandwich place and the other was a sandwich place, but the binding tie is that you can customize your order on a little sheet of paper. For someone who gets anxious at Starbucks trying to remember all the components that she has to say in the right order (lest she look like a dumbass), an uncomplicated, fill-in-the-bubbles order form is a god-send.After wading through the many, MANY options for customizing my 'panini,' I handed in my order. While the girl behind the counter was not particularly pleasant, it was lunch time on Green St., so I guess I can't fault her too much. My sandwich came out pretty quickly, so no complaints there. Now, the sandwich.....heaven. It's possible that I'm just really good at looking at ingredients and creating a delicious sandwich. I'm not above tooting my own horn there. But I think it's also possible that Za's just makes a mean toasted sandwich. Since they serve it open-faced, I can't really go along with their calling it a 'panini.' And it needs to be eaten with a knife and fork. But it was delicious. In case you're curious (and I know you are), the tasty sandwich I had went like this: Veggie (no meat) panini with pesto mayo, mushrooms, red onions, artichokes, red peppers, spinach, and roma tomatoes, smothered with their gouda/mozzarella cheese. I'm going to call it the Heather's Vegetarian Fake-Healthy Heart Attack Express. That's going to catch on, just watch.*P.S. A safety warning: I'm 95% sure my wallet was stolen out of my shoulder bag while upstairs at Za's. So....practice good sense, which I didn't, and don't leave your bag unattended while you get utensils and napkins.

<Content> "Mia Za's"? The hell? I'm pretty sure that when I was in college ('03-'07), this place was just plain old "Za's." But that was back in the DAY, back when shit was REAL.It's true, this place has no personality, but the food is serviceable and I like building my own pizza/salad/sandwich/pasta dish. The pizza crust is super-thin and crispy, and I like that the salads are ENORMOUS. The pasta...I could live without. I don't know why, but it kind of reminded me of pasta they might serve in the dorms. GOOD dorm pasta, yes, but still dorm pasta. Maybe that makes sense only in my head?

<Content> Mia Za's here on Green Street is the original. The other places of similar name (just, "Za's") in Champaign have disbanded from the franchise and are their own entities. Mia Za's is located in a cozy little row of businesses in the heart of Campus Town conveniently adjacent to the University of illinois' main Quad. Parking can be a bit difficult, but there are usually spaces available a block or two from the location, bring money as Parking Enforcement is serious business in and around Campus.Depending on the time of day you may be hard-pressed to find ample seating for you and your dining companion as this place is very popular with the student population. If there isn't enough room on the main floor you can head upstairs to find more tables, and a warm atmosphere with a very beautiful copper ceiling, and Italian inspired artwork on the walls.Their menu is full of incredibly tasty and healthy ingredients, and everything is cooked to order. It'll probably take longer for you to decide on what to order with the custom Pizza, Pasta, Panini, and Salad options. But never fear for those you that are indecisive; Mia Za's offers more traditional favorites as well.Prices vary on what kind of sauce or items you get, and if you get extra items. With that said you can get a "Pick 2" where you get half an order of pasta, salad, or panini served with another half order of salad, soup, or panini for just shy of 7 dollars (without drink).

<Content> if you order a combo here, one out of the two items they bring out will have something odd about it. the buffalo chicken salad that i ordered came topped with this frighteningly chewy, wiry fried chicken that I did not want to put in my mouth. My friend's apple gorgonzola salad was unappetizing with a plethora of iceberg lettuce. what does redeem za's is their selection of cheesecake factory goodies. good to keep in mind when you've had a bad day and you need something sinful to wash away the pain.

<Content> I love the soup here. Tomato Basil and whatever special of the day is on the menu. That, and the garlic bread, even though it's 80 cents.I tried a pizza once. It was wet in the middle and pretty unencumbered by flavor.I tried a smoothie once. It was aiight. Never been compelled to try another.I tried a salad once. It was pretty boring, and it made me miss Pluto's back in Palo Alto.But the tomato basil soup, I love. It's divine with its small sprinkling of grated parmesan (?) cheese that melts only halfway even though you stir it. One thing I don't appreciate is the impatient guy who calls out my name. He was pretty obnoxious this one time when I didn't respond on the first call. But rudeness and some small confusion about not having a form to just order soup won't keep me away from good soup on Green Street.Under 4 bucks for a bowl of soup that comes with a small piece of french bread is good eatz. And fast, too.

<Content> Oh Za's, how I love thee.It's changed a bit since I graduated, but it's always been one of my favorite places to get fresh-tasting, delicious food on Green Street. Seriously, where else would you go? I've been a fan for years.I have always loved their pastas the best, and they've really expanded the options. Last time I went, I got multigrain rotini with pesto and veggies. It felt really healthy and light, even though it was a sizable portion. The huge and delicious piece of garlic bread did kind of counteract the "light" feeling, however... I also had one of their delicious smoothies, and I have never gone wrong by ordering any of their infinite combos. Anything with mango in it is an automatic favorite of mine!Yeah, it's not gourmet, but for an inexpensive lunch that isn't fast food or a chain place, it's definitely the best you can get in Champaign. And oh, the nostalgia factor...

<Content> A couple people have said it best, this place has no personality. But does that mean it doesn't have yummy food? Nope! Totally delightful. Went here last night before the dinner rush at around 4 pm. It's one of those places where they give you a sheet of paper with predetermined options on it OR the option to create your own pizza, pasta, salad, or sandwich. Most of the people working the counter are just college students and therefore not necessarily skilled in helping you create awesome meals. After staring at the overwhelming menu for a little while I ended up creating my own pizza. I had garlic marinara sauce with a feta/mozzarella mix topped with red onions, olives, and sun dried tomatoes. It was kick-ass! I ate (most) of the whole thing. I did give away some of it because it was too good not to share. I had been to this place a few years ago (before it burnt down and was rebuilt) and I remember having something delicious then, too! I believe I created a pasta that time.I really had minimal interaction with staff, but everyone seemed pleasant when I did need them to place the order. They don't really "wait" on you because it's seat yourself, leave your dishes at the table. Really all you're doing is ordering at a counter; kind of like a more fancy, involved, delicious subway concept.

<Content> Za's is the first place that I ever ate in Chambana when coming to visit for the first time (summer 2003). And yes, I do have tremendous loyalty to places of my past, so maybe I'm biased.But Za's is awesome. The food isn't going to change the world, but they're well controlled portions, and highly customizable dishes bringa very "it's for me" feel to Za's. The workers (mostly college kids) have always been nice, and I've never had a thing to complain about. The upstairs seating is good enough for big crowds, and it's never been too crowded.

<Content> So disappointed in Za's! I went through the drive through to get a combo soup and salad for $6.69 which is clearly advertised on the menu. I placed my order and the total came to $8.59! I was like "what?? Did Champaign vote in another tax hike while I was asleep?" No, apparently the Caesar salad is a "premium" salad. What's in a Caesar salad that makes it a "premium"? Cheese, lettuce & dressing. They can keep their cheese, lettuce and dressing. That is way too much to pay for what it is.

<Content> This place serves the tastiest spaghetti and marinara I've ever had: the noodles and sauce form a perfect combination and exude a strong yet comfortable flavor. While it's not gourmet, it's a step way, way above ordinary red-sauce Italian, and it'll satisfy even the strongest cravings for something zesty. The price is great, too.Pretty much everything else on the menu---whether you customize it or not---will also be well prepared, well presented, and well received by your taste buds. Back in sophomore year of high school I had lunch here almost daily, and the only bad experience I can remember involved an unbearably spicy sauce that even my high-spice-tolerating Chinese friends agreed was over the top. (The chef may have just screwed up my particular order that day, but just to be safe, I'd stay away from any spicy option.)On a final note, I've always been surprised at how quickly my order is ready, regardless of how crowded the restaurant is.

<Content> I like Mia Za's, even though it's not exactly my first stop in Campustown. Lines tend to be long, and the meal I normally order is a bit steep for lunch. But it's good food and cheap Italian if you need a fix. I'm fond of the thin-crust pizza, and I normally get half with a spinach salad. But the menu is so diverse as to be overwhelming. Come prepared to fill out a scantron of deliciousness; it's totally worth it every once in a while, but the vast array of options slow the place down to no end.

<Content> This place is pretty good for fast Italian. I would place it somewhere between Fazoli's and Biaggi's. I've had their pizza, pasta, salad, and paninis, and all were flavorful and satisfying. And, since it's become "Mia Za's" (instead of just Za's), everything comes on a slightly fancier plate!Regarding my visit today, I went with a co-worker who, upon seeing the line stretching out the door, said, "...Did you want to go here, or...?" Despite the frightening line, everyone was soon inside and peering at the papers. I definitely found the ordering papers overwhelming the first time I visited a Za's, but I didn't have to wait on my co-worker, who picked out a delicious meal pretty quick. While we were waiting in line, there was a guy standing next to it checking papers and passing out cups to make sure they were clear before we got to the checkout. This proved to be genius, because we were through the line in about five minutes. In another 5-10, we had our food. And it was good. My only complaints were that my rotini wasn't exactly al dente and there were lots of onions and garlic in everything (but this is only bad for me personally).The prices vary, but if you get a lunch-sized serving and a drink, you can get out for $7-10. If it's a little bigger, or you decide you want a slice of their delicious tiramisu, it's gonna be more like $12-15.Quick, (seemingly) fresh, 'licious.

<Content> Za's is back!!!! OK, maybe it's been back for a while, but this was my first time back in Champaign since they reopened post-fire. I was so pleased to see that they still function the same way - design your own pasta, salad, panini, or pizza. This place was a major staple in my college-kid diet. The pasta sauces are all really tasty, and there are plenty of healthy veggie toppings. Let's not forget the amazing garlic bread, which is one of the best parts of any Za's trip. Can we please talk about the fact that Za's really needs to open a location in the Chicago area? Until then, I'll just have to wait and get my fix next time I'm down in CU. Sigh.

<Content> Pretty standard fare here, you can customize everything, mix and match whatever crazy combination you can come up with. My absolute faaavorite pasta sauces are the cajun alfredo and cajun pesto. I think they just add some kind of spice to make their normal sauces spicy but you should definitely try them if you like spicy food. I wish they could sell me just the sauces... that's all I would ever need in life. I'd add it to everything I eat.I always mean to try their desserts from the Cheesecake Factory but am always too full so either plan ahead to save room or get some to go!

<Content> Za's is a pretty good lunch option on Campustown. They serve salads, pasta, sandwiches and pizza, all made to order. You can select from their suggested dishes or order your own by choosing ingredients. It's all very reasonable ($4 to $7), not great cuisine but very tasty nonetheless. To boot, the employees are all very friendly. It's just a three minute walk from my office, so I suspect I'll be going there a lot to eat.

<Content> I was so sad when I found out that Za's had burned down, but I'm glad that they have rebuilt. I love coming here because the service is friendly and the food is good. I come here when I need a quick bite to eat and they never fail to deliver. The ordering system is pretty straightforward. There are slips of paper with the menu items and you fill out what you want, such as proteins, veggies, etc. and give it to the cashier and voila...that's it. Quick and simple.

<Content> This food is very delicious. I have only bought the pizza from there which is delicious, however after an hour or two you'd be hungry again due to it being a thin crust pizza. I don't think there is an option for thicker crust though. The cash register lady is also very kind and friendly as well. Food only takes a couple minutes to be finished as well.

<Content> This place is a nice place to grab lunch and has a very clean and comfortable atmosphere. You can basically pick/make anything to be a pasta, salad, panini. However, the quality control needs to be improved. Once I got frozen lettuce on my sandwich that had freezer burns. I can order the same exact custom thing twice, and it will taste quite different. Also, the cheesecake I got should have been better refrigerated. All in all, an okay restaurant to grab lunch at with friends with a good atmosphere. Control quality can be improved.

<Content> Za's (or Mia Za's or whatever they are calling it now) is one of those places that my fiancee and I always eat at when we visit U of I. It is definitely a solid eatery and one of the better options for food near campus. Personally, I am quite found of their white pizza, but honestly, any of the pizza or pasta dishes will do a good job of satiating your hunger. I recommend going on the weekends too. For some reason everyone goes there during the week for lunch, but then forgets about it on the weekends and there is no line at all.

<Content> Wait, what did you say? You can custom make your own pasta dish? I'm in. Za's delicious italian selections have definitely made a name for themselves. Everyone love's Za's. It's inexpensive and it's good. The meals are made in a speedy process, so don't worry if it's crowded, it usually moves along just fine.

<Content> Another establishment I frequented quite a bit while @ the U of I. I loved creating my own pasta dish with fresh veggies and delicious sauces, fresh parmesan and a HUGE piece of garlic bread. It was very reasonably priced and the upstairs dining area is very nice. I took my parents here many times during moms and dads weekends and they also fell in love with Za's...you cannot go wrong! It does get SUPER crowded during lunchtime, so go at an off time if you want to just waltz right in...I need to go back and visit just to get me some Za's!

<Content> Better than the Mia Za's in Ann Arbor (though that's not saying much). I am tempted to give this place on two stars though, because the slice of cheesecake I ordered was FROZEN and ICY and took too long to thaw out.

<Content> nommmmmmmmmm. This place is awesome. I have to admit, the first time I came in, I was slightly overwhelmed by the menu cards that you have to fill out.. only because there's so many options and I wanted them all. The girl at the register must have known I was clueless/overwhelmed/starved bc she offered a few suggestions. I ultimately went with chicken alfredo with broccoli. It was delicious. I suck at trying new things when I find something I like, so I have yet to order anything else. Well except the broccoli cheddar soup. That's also really good. I'm pretty picky when it comes to my soup too.. it's not too watery or salty. Good job Zas. My friends have all been pretty satisfied too and they tend to branch out a lot more than I do.Overall, I'd say this place is pretty underrated. I'm kind of bummed I discovered how awesome it is towards the end of my college career because it would have fixed a lot of those "ugh its saturday i'm too lazy to make food" kinds of days.

<Content> A Green St staple that doesn't deserve the hype. The food is greasy, the cheese is plastic-y, dishes oversalted etc. Nonetheless you can get a lot of food (calories) for a pretty low price, so starving students have an excuse.

<Content> My favourite place on campus, Za's is always the place to go when we can't decide where to go, because ultimately everyone says yes to Za's! Their paninis, pizzas, sandwiches, and pasta, everything's great. I was very sad when this place burned down, it took an year, but its back and as good as ever. Upstairs is great to sit and eat.

<Content> Great pasta dishes here. The sandwiches are also good. Their "make your own" options are nice, everyone can find something they like. The atmosphere is nice, I prefer to eat upstairs as there is more room, and I have never had a problem with the people who work there. The price is rather high though, $6-$8 for a pasta dish, most of which is the pasta itself? Give me a break.

<Content> I had high hopes for this place. The menu looks great, lots of options and fresh choices. But I've given it a couple of tries, and the food just isn't anything special. I've had the pear and goat cheese salad, and the portobello pizza. The ingredients didn't seem fresh, and both dishes seemed hastily thrown together. There are better places to eat.

<Content> The last few times I was there Mia Za's almost always messed something up in our order. The last straw was when they included nuts in my wife's salad -- I explained to them that she was allergic, they took the salad back and I watched them just pick the nuts off in the back when they thought I couldn't see them. When they gave it back to me I explained to them that was not sufficient as she is highly allergic. They very rudely took the salad back and made a fresh one.

<Content> i agree with michelle K's review - who's Mia? this used to be just Za's! ('02-'05). the menu used to be simple b/w, and now it's all technicolored and double sided. they had plenty of options before, but now it's just overwhelming. i found myself hovering over the counter for way too long to fill out the order sheet, and afterwards, i wasn't sure if i'd missed anything...but yes, the food is about the same. it still tastes like dorm pasta, but good dorm pasta. although, the garlic bread isn't as tasty as before..hmmm?

<Content> The food at this quick restaurant is a hearty meal. I'm VERY full after eating here. I order penne in creamy marinara with spinach. The food is delicious, especially the garlic bread that comes with the pasta. I give Za's 4 out of 5 stars because the food quality is inconsistent. Some days that food is warm and some days it is cold. Sometimes my plate is filled with food, other times there isn't enough food to get full. Some days the sauce to pasta ratio is perfect and sometimes I cannot even see the sauce on my pasta.

<Content> First of all, free chips and salsa as soon as you sit down. There's TV's plastered every where so most seats will give you a good view of any sports game you'd like to watch. The burgers are absolutely packed full of goodness while still maintaining a reasonable price. I got a California Burger with fries and shared a pitcher of Long Island with one other friend for just $12.00. The service was amiable as well. This place also features some dance nights, but I'm not sure when those happen.

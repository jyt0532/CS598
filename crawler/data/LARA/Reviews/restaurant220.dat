<Content> one of my favorite restaurants on campus. However quality varies. On weekdays when storeowners are here, foods usually better. But on weekends when staff (I guess they are students who work there part-time) prepares the food.. it sometimes lack the flavor and quality.I recommend crawfish ettoufle. it's served with nachos. I like to eat it with tons of spice. It's cheesy and flavourful.

<Content> We made our first visit to J Gumbos on a whim. We hadn't heard anything about it, but we love Cajun food. We both ordered the Lafitte bowl (portions come in half or full bowl sizes). The full bowl is a generous-enough amount of food, even for $8. The bowl came with a choice of bread; we both took the garlic bread.The Jean Lafitte bowl is half corn stew (sweet, cream-based) and half chicken stew (spicy, tomato-based). The corn stew was far too sweet for either of our palates (aka Bumblebee Stew, per the menu). The staff warned us that the chicken stew was extremely hot (aka Voodoo Chicken), but we found it only edging toward spicy. Fortunately, there was hot sauce on the table. We had a choice of adding toppings of cheese, sour cream, jalepeno slices, green onions, and seasoning.We also had a choice of white or brown rice as the base (corn chips are another option). The rice was a decent texture in each case (with the brown cut to a finer grain), but the rice-to-stew ratio was off: way too much rice. The chicken in the chicken stew was finely shredded and there wasn't enough meat to make it very substantial. However, the ingredients were fresh (something that can be hard to find in campustown, where many places serve pre-frozen and re-heated fare) and the recipes not far off the mark -- if modified to reduce the protein for costs and appeal to a public not comfortable with more authentic, stronger Cajun flavors. The bread was nothing special: commercial and lacking in texture or flavor.Overall: The food was decent, but not good or great. For the quality of the food, we each agreed we'd give it a 5 out of 10.J Gumbos in a national chain, with franchiser-owners, with the next closest located in Bloomington, IL. At the Urbana location, the staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean and comfortable: a step up from a crowded fast food environment.

<Content> I can't believe I didn't come here sooner. Several of my friends recommended that I come here earlier. I had an opportunity to sample several of the gumbo dishes before I selected my choice. Unfortunately, I forgot the name of my dish however it has a perfect amount of sweetness to complement the rest of the gumbo. I will definitely come here again.

<Content> Mmm. Take me back to Louisiana. I love this place. Everything is mushy and flavorful and mushy. I have soft spot for soft food. I am willing to embrace that my favorite meals could be considered by some to be a gross and desperate college rendition of Gerber's, and while I enjoy decadent, gourmet meals, J Gumbo's belongs to the former class and it's fucking fantastic. I give J Gumbo's five stars not because it's "as good as it gets" (we can surely all agree that this isn't a master chef-endorsed bistro), but because the food is delicious for its niche, a nice, fast, yummy gumbo place. Additionally, the staff is great. J Gumbo's outshines campus restaurants.

<Content> I am extremely sad and disappointed in the fact that I only discovered this place in my last year in UIUC. The staffs are all friendly and are willing to let you sample pretty much everything before you make your purchase upon request. I am usually not that big on southern cuisine, but this place is the bomb! Not only do they serve gumbos over white or brown rice, they also serve it over nachos! The portions are huge for what you are paying for! I usually eat a lot so I can single handedly finish a full size serving, but my roommates who eat like a normal human split one serving into two meals. My personal favorite is the drunken chicken for those that are looking for some spicy kicks on your tongue. They are extremely fast as well. All the food are ready to serve. Simply have to walk in , order, and enjoy yourself! They also have a punch card available for those that plans to visit regularly ( which you should! )

<Content> Surprising find in Urbana, extended hours (10pm) for late night takeout.Food is not cooked to order, and is served from the steam table at the counter, but for the dishes they offer this really helps develop the flavor.On our first visit we had the red beans and rice (a little bland, not quite as smoky as I like RB&R to be), drunken chicken (very good), and bourbon chicken (sweet, and thankfully not that nasty teriyaki style bourbon sauce). The "heat" ratings on the board are pretty accurate for a mid-western palate, and but I think the food could use a touch more heat (yes, i could add some tabasco, but cooked in heat has different flavor than a couple of drops of hot sauce).Price was right, it was fast, and food was flavorful. Its a keeper ... hope it stays.

<Content> Although I appreciate Cajun food, I found the food to be tasteless even though the portions were great for the price (under $8 for two dishes).I ordered the red beans and rice and bourbon chicken. I was expecting chunks of bourbon chicken but it was shredded. I believe the red beans and rice came with some andouille sausage, but the sausage lacked kick. Perhaps this is what J Gumbo's meant by how neither of these dishes were spicy since J Gumbos has a spice rating on their menu.If/when I go back, I plan to go for the very spicy stuff in hopes of more flavor.

<Content> I initially went here because a friend of mine had tried their food at a charity event. This place motivated me to create a yelp account so that I could right a review.I am so glad they were at that event because I am in love! Right off the bat they offer you a sample of any item on the menu. This allows you to actually know if you are going to like what you are ordering. I tried the bumblebee stew and said I wanted more spice. The very helpful waiter recommended the Jean Lafitte. It was a delicious mix of Voodoo Chicken and bumble stew. My friend had their Drunken Chicken. This one is delicious for someone who maybe doesn't want a lot of spice. We did not realize how huge the portions were and everything sounded so good that we ordered the Crawfish Cheese dip as well. It was fabulous!I am already planning on going again this week. Food can draw me in, but as a college student, what really brings me back is a great price as well. You can get a huge bowl that will give you left overs or leave you really full for only 7 dollars. They also offer and half portion or 4.50. I recommend also grabbing a piece of cornbread. You will not regret eating here.

<Content> Red hot chicken and drunken chicken are both really impressive. Spicy and flavorful. I've been twice and I need to get back more often: I forget this place exists.The counter-staff were noticeably friendly. Definitely worth checking out.

<Content> First time visit but it certainly will not be my last. What is so great about this place is that they allow you to sample all the dishes first. They have a variety like voodoo chicken, ratatouille, gumbo, white chili chicken red hot, other dishes all served over your choice of white or brown rice and you get a piece of garlic bread. I sampled the white Chili which was pretty delicious and then sampled the chicken red hot. Between the two chicken red hot was the winner especially since I love spicy food. The meal was super delicious and the portions are great. I didn't get the big bowl but the small that I got was more than enough. The prices are nice for the portions sizes. I will definitely be coming back to try the rest!! The atmosphere was great as well.

<Content> This fast-food restaurant chain serves red beans and rice, jambalaya, Bourbon Street chicken, creole ratatouille, gumbo, crawfish etouffee, white chili and other chicken dishes. They are located in the building just south of Krannert Center for the Performing Arts. We ate there on a Friday at noon and it was packed. My Voodoo Chicken was delish. They were refilling the steam table because it was busy and the manager pulled out a plastic bag filled with an entree and squeezed the contents into the bin on the steam table. This kind of procedure might be easiest and most efficient but the optics are all wrong.He should have carried the stainless steel tub into the back room, filled it from the plastic bag out of view of the customers, then returning to the front of the house with a piping hot tub of food.But it is quick, reasonably priced and the food was good. The member of our group who got the Crawfish Etouffee was not as impressed with the taste.For no apparent reason they feel compelled to have two flat screen TVs which no one was watching, playing CNN as background entertainment while folks attempted to enjoy their lunch.

<Content> The Voodoo Chicken was so good that I ordered a second helping to-go for tomorrow. Set up a little like a deli, it's not super-fancy (which means no waiter to tip). The staff was super friendly, explained the spicy and non-spicy options, and offered samples right away. There was not a single marginal or overpriced menu item that I saw or tried. It was all excellent. Very unique for this area. All-in-all, it was a legit experience.

<Content> I finally got to try this place yesterday after allowing my curiosity to linger for nearly a whole Spring semester. I love cajun spices/flavors, but this was only okay for me. I ordered the Drunken Chicken bowl, and while the flavors were pretty good, I think I was looking for a little more heat. However, the portions were generous, and if you're looking for something quick & dirty, this is a satisfying alternative to your typical fast-food chains. I'll be coming back to try some of the other items on the menu.

<Content> I've been here twice for lunch now. I really liked that they let you try samples of all of the different entrees before you place your order, so you don't end up getting something you don't like. I really liked the drunk chicken. They give you a ton of food for the price too.

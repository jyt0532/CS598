<Content> Very slow service. 20 minutes to get drinks, well over 30 minutes to get food after that. They didnt have heat on today and all customers werr complaining how cold it was. First impressions last ... and sadly this one fell far short of acceptable.

<Content> Absolutely the worst service I've ever had anywhere in Champaign-Urbana. After waiting 45 minutes for our food( with no drink refills) we inquired what was taking so long. A server( not ours) came back and said they were just getting ready to start our ticket. There were literally 5 other tables in the entire place. This was on a Wednesday night at 7pm. We left after my husband paid for the drinks. I just wanted to scream. Awful awful awful!

<Content> My wife and I went to Denny's for breakfast about 3 weeks ago ..... let me say that service was terrible, we were seated and was told that someone will be over to take our order , we waited for 20 min and no one came over to check our table, here is the interesting part, it was almost empty in there, and after 25 min of waiting we left. not going back anytime soon.

<Content> It is what it is. First, the food never comes out like the pictures on the menu. Second, you are really getting service more than the food. We were traveling and provided a better experience that fast food for not much more money, especially when you factor in the free refills on pop.

<Content> Went there today for late breakfast and the place was kind of dead. Food was decent but service was slow especially considering that they weren't busy. But prices are reasonable.

<Content> What can you say about Denny's - the food is what it is, its breakfast food. As long its not completely messed up, you cant really have any complaints. Service is what determines the customer satisfaction at places like Denny's. We had pretty good experiences with Denny's, in general, at various locations. So we were excited to see a location open up in Champaign. We have been there many times by now. The service was acceptable. Depends heavily on who is attending to you and what mood they are in. But overall, we didnt have many complaints. There was one instance when we ordered the milkshake, she gave us just the serving glass and did not give the mixing glass with the "extra" which they claim to be part of the order. The overall experience on that day was below par. The wait staff definitely needs more training in doing their work and keeping customers happy. They come in knowing what the food is going to be like, make them come back and keep the place running with a good customer service. Not sure why it is so hard to understand this simple logic.

<Content> Went there for breakfast last week. Perhaps they read the other three reviews and learned from them because my experience was different. The hostess seated me promptly and the waitress took my coffee order immediately. I looked over the menu and as soon as I put it down, she came over for my order. She was friendly and courteous. I ordered their Red, White, and Blue special and it was quite good. Everything was done as I requested. My coffee cup was kept filled, too. Someone may have pointed out to them the dissatisfaction of the other reviewers and changes were made or I may have just caught them on a good day. Having three different people on three different dates all give negative reviews leads me to believe that I was just lucky. I guess the best advice I can give is "Caveat Emptor."

<Content> If I could I'd give zeros stars, trust me when I say I wasn't expecting much from this place and they performed below my already low expectation. This place is the worst restaurant experience you can get in Illinois. My girlfriend and I arrived at 11:20pm and didn't get drinks until 11:45 the servers were all lazy and one in particular made the experience terrible. The food arrived at 12:20 and wasn't anything close to what we expected. Our drinks never got refilled, no one asked how our food was, and our server seemed to have a tantrum every five minutes. I can't honestly fully express how bad this place is. I would advise not going here. Save your money. I left a well deserved 0 for a tip and when talking to the manager one server stood behind her giggling and the other interrupted saying he did his job. Stay away from the heavy set African American server and the red eyed Caucasian server.

<Content> The food at Dennys is always just okay to me anyways but this location is horrible. When we walked in I noticed an exchange between a manager and an angry customer and right away that sent up a red flag. Our waitress was TERRIBLE she had to be reminded what our drink orders were, reminded to bring us silverware and even when the food came out, not only did it take forever (at least 45 minutes) it was wrong and she forgot to bring half the order. Even after asking about our missing food twice it never came. She was not friendly and acted like we were annoying her bc our order was wrong. Of course the food that we ordered but never received was on the bill and had to be changed. The manager said they were going to take an additional 20% off but in the end they couldn't figure out how to do it and charged us full price anyway. As we were walking out we over heard another unhappy customer complaining to management so I guess they just really suck all around. Never going back.

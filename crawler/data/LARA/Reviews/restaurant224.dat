<Content> We were attracted by the gyro advert on the side of the shop. We mentioned wanting Mediterranean food and it appeared for us. The proprietor was running the whole place. He took a moment to get to us, but because he was obviously finishing making others food. He makes sure all of the food is fresh. Between the gyro and the fish sandwich, and our piles of fries, my friend and I were totally satisfied with our food.The place was clean. The proprietor obviously takes pride in his work. Highly recommend. Will return if in Champaign again.

<Content> This Subway is fine, I used to get sandwiches here most days when I worked at nearby Sam's Club which gave me good pay but no benefits or opportunities for career growth.-1 for too small a parking lot for the "lunch rush", during which I and other over-qualified, under-employed folks crowded into this Subway because it takes credit card, and none of us had real liquidity

<Content> This place is dirty & I found a long hair in my sandwich.....Needless to say, it took me awhile to eat Subway again.I haven't had any issues with the Subway in the mall or the Subway on Staley & Springfield.

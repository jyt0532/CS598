<Content> I've given this place a wide berth due to the two star rating they have as an average. Circumstances took me there about 10 days ago; I've been back twice since. It's been solid all three times, and for around 6 bucks a pop. While I agree with a few things that previous reviewers have said -- the mac & cheese is pretty much straight out of the box --the meat has always been really moist and smokey. I've had brisket, pulled pork, and rib tips. The last one is definitely not for the squeamish by the way; it's a visceral experience, but well worth it. The only sides I've had are the mac and cheese, and the fries. As I mentioned, the mac and cheese is pretty generic, but the fries! That's where it's at. Obviously, knocking off THE barbecue place in town is a tall order. While Bobo's doesn't do it, it does what it does well. If you're not in the mood to wait for over an hour or pay 20 bucks for a meal (or both) on the other side of town, give Bobo's a shot.

<Content> We've been driving by this place for months as we head home from Champaign. Today we were heading home and decided to pick up some to take home. While we waited for the order we noticed that the place is clean and the staff very friendly. My wife and I both ordered burnt ends, a special, for about eight dollars each, and it came with two sides, a drink, and three sauces. We took it home-- about nine miles-- and it was still hot when we got home even though it is packaged just in styrofoam containers. The burnt ends were perfect. Each of us got four nice sized pieces-- about 1 inch by 2 inches. They were sitting inside a toasted hamburger bun. They were perfectly done. Nice char and very tender, with great flavor. The barbeque sauces were fine. I am not a fan of bbq sauces, especially the sweet tomato based ones, so I was glad they put them on the side. My wife said they were tasty; the hot was too hot for her taste and the cherry-chipotle too sweet for her taste, but she thought the flavor was good, though BoBo's will never compete with Black Dog in Urbana.The sides, however, were a little problematic. My wife ordered broccoli casserole and chipotle macaroni and cheese. I ordered cole slaw and greens for my sides. When we got home, however, we found four tubs of macaroni and cheese. While I have little doubt that, had we driven back, they would have corrected the order, we weren't going to make the 18 mile round trip to do that. It is noteworthy that they have a nice selection of sides to go along with the meals. Unfortunately I cannot say anything about them. My wife liked the mac and cheese well enough. She says "it's mac and cheese, with a little chipotle flavor added." If you can't make acceptable mac and cheese in Kraft's hometown, you shouldn't be in business. And this was acceptable. Too much of it for us, especially since I won't eat Mac and Cheese, but it was good enough. She was sad that she didn't get her broccoli casserole, and I was sorry I didn't get to try the greens and cole slaw slides. Maybe some other day.Not sure if we'll go back or not. It is probably unfair not to try again. The meat was good, and while screwing up the order the first time left a "bad taste in my mouth" it probably shouldn't put them on my avoid-list.

<Content> The food is absolutely fantastic. Especially the Smoked Turkey. Don't be so cheap with the BBQ cups. Come on you offer 8 different sauces. Let the customer try then all. It makes you look like a cheap skate.

<Content> So far I have tried the pulled chicken and the pulled pork sandwiches, the fries, and a selection of the different sauces. The meat itself is okay in terms of texture. It doesn't have a particularly smokey flavor or anything. The thing that makes the meat "BBQ" is the sauce that you put on it. Otherwise, it's just tender, slow-cooked meat. Some may say it's not fair to just order and sandwich and then review a BBQ joint, but hey; there are a lot of people like me who don't want to spend $15 on ribs every time we want BBQ. In terms of the sandwich, the bun is the biggest weakness. It's just a generic, slightly stale, un-toasted bun. At least it's better than plain white bread. The fries are prepared fresh when you order. They're the sort that are clearly potatoes (which is nice), but they're not crispy at all. They're kind of soggy and chewy. Not really my thing. They're also quite bland. I've tried the mild and hot sauces and they're both fine. The hot isn't overpowering and the mild is pretty average. I also tried the Dr. Pepper sauce, which is intriguing. It's very sweet and works well with chicken.The lemon shakeups are pretty decent. They cost a bit more than a fountain drink, but they do taste like what you get at the state fair. Overall, BoBo's BBQ is pretty forgettable. It's adequate, but with places like Black Dog around, it's just too generic. The prices are lower than Black Dog (which just gets higher and higher every year), but I'm not sure they're low enough to justify the mediocrity of the food. I would be shocked if this place is here in a year.

<Content> I'm a sucker for pulled chicken and wanted to love this place. While I prefer white meat pulled chicken, I've come around to the fact that most places use dark meat. BoBo's is no exception. But the dark meat was tasty. Moist, cooked well. Unfortunately there was a bone in my sandwich and some gummy joint meat. I know bones happen occasionally, but the place was dead when I got there, so there was no excuse. And if a place is going to have pulled chicken, they should use chewable pieces and make sure not to include any of the nasty joint stuff that doesn't chew. Yuck.The fries were good, well salted, fresh cut, the right amount. And the sauces were enjoyable. I had the hot, mild, and chipotle peach. All were delicious in different ways. I won't write this place off just yet, but I will NOT be getting the chicken again. I'll stick to beef (no pork as I don't eat pig products).The service was great, though. Very friendly, and the cashier alerted me to a great deal they have.

<Content> The pulled pork sandwich meat was tender and juicy, but had no sort of special appeal at all and was quite bland. What about the spices? The plain white bread was soggy.I actually liked the home fries a lot. They were fresh and tasty.The mac and cheese was soggy and stale and tasted like the stuff I can easily make at home out of the box.The worst criticism you can give a barbecue joint is that the food is bland. The food here is super bland. I predict they won't be open long. Sad.

<Content> I love BBQ foods and its nearly impossible for me to hate it but this place is horrible. I'd rather go to Lil Porgy's down the street. They are a little bit better than Q smokehouse on campus but jeez.

<Content> I had the beef brisket platter w/ 2 sides (mac n cheese and the broccoli cheese casserole) but didn't have cornbread because they ran out, so they gave me sliced bun. I also got the one pound of rib tips and that came with fries. The barbecue sauce I chose for the whole order was mild. I ordered the lemon shake up. Overall the meat is cooked to a perfect tenderness and the meat falls off the rib tips, on the other hand, the seasonings were just not there for me. I thought it could have definitely been seasoned much better. The sides also were not very good, they did not seem fresh, even the fries. The barbecue sauce I choose was not good either. I've had better lemon shake ups too.So in the end, I think this place has to get better or I don't see it being open for long. I may give it another chance down the road to see if they make any improvements. With Lil' Porgy's down the street I think they need to figure out something. We shall see.

<Content> I was visiting the Champaign area with my family who just recently moved there. And they suggested that I try this buffet. When I got there was amazed how good their food is. It is far better than my regular buffet in Lansing. If I ever return back to Champaign I will be going back, even though it is a little pricy.

<Content> I was tricked in to going here for lunch by one co-worker who said to another 'we should go to that great Chinese place you like'. Then we arrive and damn... it's a GD buffet!Requisite deep-fried things, Mongolian BBQ (didn't try, but no scary smells and co-worker #1 didn't get sick after eating his) and sushi section (run of the mill buffet sushi, but I didn't touch anything raw). Rows and rows of hot food plus a row just for salad bar (with OK veggies). I loaded up on the sauteed green beans and pulled other cooked veggies out of various trays. Not all of the chicken was breaded mystery meat - I liked the Black Pepper Chicken.All in all, this was a decent Chinese buffet. Don't get me wrong, I still felt like crap afterwards and needed a nap...

<Content> In general, I am not a fan of Chinese buffets. They start out amazing, but then as time goes on, they become a mess and the quality of their food turns sour. However, this is not the case with Chinatown Buffet. No, they are not amazing, but their food quality has been pretty consistent. You can get a good selection of Chinese foods and be a patron of their mediocre sushi bar. You can also create your own stir fry or ask for a steak to be grilled for you. There's plenty of seating here and you generally know what you're coming here for -- quantity, not quality. If you have that as your mindset, you won't necessarily be disappointed.Overall, Chinatown Buffet isn't bad. It's cheap and you get your fill.

<Content> This place stinks! The service was lousy and food was below par. The floors seemed to be sticky in some areas and wet in others which might cause an injury. We went for dinner service and made a reservation for this place and was charge a reservation fee (not disclosed). We had hot tea at our table and yet we were charged per cup. If a single person orders tea, the customer would get a pot and a cup. But we were charged 7 teas for only 2 pots and 7 cups. A huge markup on tea! Also, we were told that they ran out of hot tea (which was found to be untrue later on). How hard is it to have boiling water and tea leaves? We were told that the tea was made in a large pot made in the morning to be served throughout the day. So not fresh tea is served to customers.When we complained and ask for the manager, a manager was not brought to our table and instead the staff was deciding who wanted to be "the manager."Large selection of food, ranging from sushi to stir fry. The food was some warm at best and some of the sushi was not fresh. I suggest doing the stir fry if you want a hot meal.Finally, what was disgusting is the employees were wrapping napkins to the eating utensils after servicing guests and touching the fork and spoons heads without washing their hands. This is unhygienic and extreme unprofessional. If you want clean utensils, I suggest the disposable chopsticks or bring your own fork and spoon.The only reason why this only given one star was that the ice cream machine misspelled "swirl" with "swril". I had the "swril" =)Please look elsewhere for Chinese food. Your stomach will thank you and you will definitely have better service than this dump.

<Content> I am not sure what to think about this place. It is big. The food is mostly fried. I much preferred the slightly more expensive Crazy Buffet, but since it went out of business a couple times I must have been one of the only ones. What this place has to offer:Make your own stir-fry, steaks, ice-cream machines, dessert table, many typical American Chinese staples. Also pizza, salmon, crab legs, chicken wings, soups, sometimes duck, and crab legs. (The crab legs tend to go quick!)The problem is that not all of it is that good. You'll get full, of course, but you might feel a bit guilty afterwards. Salad bar? Not really, it's not that kind of place.Sometimes they have fried shrimp balls, greasy little nuggets of compressed shrimp meat. They are the best thing here in my opinion. Terrible for you, like everything else, but delicious. I am also partial to the fried dough with sesame seeds on the outside and red bean paste on the inside. They're on the dessert table.The "fried meat + syrupy sauce + maybe a vegetable or two" dishes aren't really to my taste, but they have a lot of them. There's sweet and sour chicken as well, and dumplings. The stir-fry options aren't as involved as, say, Flat Top but this place is generally cheaper. You can get meat mixed in with the veggies at the fry-grill. The sushi has improved a lot in the time since I started going there. It is still, definitely, buffet sushi but it's not bad and they seem to make more fairly often.We go here about once a year, which seems about right to me.

<Content> Wills right this place is disgusting. The food is not kept hot. This not only does not taste good it can also be potentially life threatening, and I will never understand why you need a waitress at a buffet. The dining room is ran down. The one thing I cannot tolerate in a restaurant is a dirty restroom and this place has one of the dirtiest restrooms I've ever seen. If what you can see is dirty just imagine how dirty that kitchen is. There's no way I will ever go there again.

<Content> I give it three stars for size alone. IMHO, the bigger the Chinese buffet, the better. You know what the food is gonna taste like (meh), you know how much you will eat (too much), and you know how it will make you feel afterward (like a meat turtle: thisiswhyyourefat.com/po). So, this place is huge. It has lots and lots of choices of crap Chinese fast food to eat. The food is not at all bad when compared to most crap Chinese fast food, but a fried turd is still a turd. Also, and this is the biggest highlight of the restaurant, they have a station where you can select ingredients for them to cook you in a wok, like at Flattop Grill. Their crab rangoons are pretty good. There is also a gift shop (WTF?) in case you want to relish your trip here forever. They will let you take some with you, though I never have. Expect to spend about $10 with a drink, a little less for lunch.

<Content> I am somewhat of a Chinese buffet connoisseur. It's a family staple to find a Chinese buffet on every vacation that we go on. It's both a blessing and a curse, but one of my favorites is Chinatown. They have a huge selection and unlike most places they keep the food fresh. I have been told it's a good sign when an Asian restaurant is packed with Asians, and this is true here. They also have a plethora of fresh sushi that is on par with a lot of the sushi places in the area. I don't get the bad reviews with this place, but my only complaint is the plethora of townies.

<Content> As far as a buffet goes, Chinatown is one of the larger ones I've been to. As I recall they had 6 buffet bars, with maybe 40 things to choose from. They have your standard fare of various deep fried mystery meats, hidden in thick sauces to cover their low quality. Finally, as you'd expect, they have a large desert and ice cream bar.Interestingly though, they had a whole section where you could make your own bowl of food and have them cook it for you. There were lots of veggies, meats, and various sauces to choose from. Simply put everything in a bowl and the staff tosses it onto a huge grill, similar to places like Mongolian BBQ. This might be your safest bet, as you know exactly what your eating.I'll admit it, I'm not a huge buffet fan, so I'm a little biased. I give it 3 stars based on size alone.

<Content> I've gone to Chinatown buffet more time than I'd like to admit -- This is your run-of-the-mill Chinese buffet, with lots of Americanized Chinese food and dishes containing Krab (with a K). The food isn't very good, but the only redeeming quality is the all-you-can-eat snow crab legs and Chinese-style crayfish you get on weekend nights. I've been there for lunch once and the quality of food was very different from what you'd see around dinner-time... The worst part was the clams, which were full of sand.

<Content> Almost everything there was awful, and it was pretty overpriced. We went on a Sunday for lunch, and they charged us 11.99 because their was duck and crab legs on the bar. I didn't see the crab legs or duck refilled at all the whole time we were there. Their General Tso's chicken was deep fried chicken rolled in that red, syrupy, sticky sweet and sour sauce most places have. It didn't even taste like General Tso's: it was like eating candy. Their crab ragoon was mostly soggy wanton with a penny-sized dollop of cream cheese and crab, and it was really cold. Their sushi was very small with barely any filling.I did give it two stars instead of one because of the stir fry bar. You fill up a bowl full of veggies and they will make it fresh for you. It was really good -maybe because it was hot and fresh - but not 11.99 good. I've bought those frozen kits that you make at home in a skillet, and it was just as good. They do give you a lot of meat, but who pays that much at a buffet just to eat one thing? If you want GOOD Chinese food, I suggest you go somewhere else,

<Content> I am surprised to see that more yelp reviewers do not enjoy Chinatown Buffet as much as I do. The food is consistently tasty -- the standard Chinese dishes, the sushi, and the Mongolian barbeque, which I sampled for the first time on Christmas. Some of my favorites include General's Chicken, Pepper Chicken, and Mongolian Pork (or beef or chicken).Although I love the food here in general, there are a couple of negatives: the desserts and the chairs. The desserts are the general unappealing desserts that seem to be standard at several Chinese buffets. Many of the chairs are in dire need of repair -- torn plastic covering and wobbly.So ... if you can live with chairs that are in a state of disrepair, his just might be the place to scratch your itch for a variety of Chinese dishes.

<Content> It was just ok. It was so close to my hotel, and I didn't feel like driving around. The sushi was eh, the food was eh. It's a huge ass buffet, almost too big. If they made it smaller, they could focus on making everything better. It's just your average Chinese buffet. You get what you pay for. I don't think I would go again.

<Content> Nasty. First time I've ever felt DIZZY from eating something. I discovered that the crab rangoon was acceptable, and the red-bean filled donuts were actually kinda good. Otherwise, nothing else even tastes much like food. And that's my opinion after trying one plate of the least unappetizing things I saw. Both my partner and I had seriously uncomfortable stomachs afterwards.If I had to go here again, I'd just eat a million red bean donuts. But I'm pretty sure we won't have the misfortune of being invited here by someone again.

<Content> As I expected--greasy, fried, quasi-Chinese-but-mostly-American food. Egg tarts good. Not worth experimenting though if you've never been here. I think there was seriously only one vegetable dish, and Chinese eat a lot of vegetables. So, it's that kind of "chinese" buffet.

<Content> Not the best Chinese in town, but I think my perception of this place is affected by circumstance. I've only come here when I'm craving Chinese, will be in the area, and am starving. Therefore, I appreciate the decent selection at a cheap price, and the bottomless crab rangoon and soft serve.

<Content> Why are you reading reviews of a buffet? There's not much to say. Chinatown is a Chinese buffet, and that's all you really need to know. There is a huge selection of foods, including a decent sushi bar, desert table, and a pretty good stir-fry grill. A few dishes are really good but the majority are just ok - but that's the point of a buffet, really.

<Content> This is a o.k. Chinese buffet. There is a large variety of food that seems standard at many Chinese buffets. The food is good, when I went it seemed like there was good turnover so food wasn't sitting out too long. There is a section of food that can be cooked over the grill, which is something that I haven't seen in other buffets in the area. If you are looking for Chinese food, I would order take out. If you want a buffet, then this can do.

<Content> Food was very good! Also very fresh!! The staff is somewhat rude. They are very short with you. We never got a refill on drinks. And every time the kitchen staff was out to check the food, you had to watch out where they were going. They could cut in front of you and stand right in the middle of everything like you are in the way. But good food! Large variety and stir fry!!

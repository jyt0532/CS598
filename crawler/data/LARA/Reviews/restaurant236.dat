<Content> Restaurant review:Inexpensive, filling, and delicious summarizes my experience at O'Charley. I had seen this restaurant a few times driving around the area and thought it was a portillo's like restaurant; but after checking out the website I realize it was more in line with TGIF or Chili's, but better. We came on a Saturday night and were able to be seated after a few minutes wait. The waitress was super friendly and helpful. We all ended up with the 12.99 prime rib special (8 oz of prime rib, 1 side, and a appetizer to share between 2 people). If you wanted the whole lb of prime rib it was 6 dollars more. The appetizer choices were limited to southern style pickle chip, twisted chips and queso, and spinach artichoke dip with tortilla chips. We chose the last one because the other two were not really good options. While you wait you get a basketful of very soft warm bread with a nice sweet butter. This was maybe even better than Texas Roadhouse cinnamon butter. The appetizer was okay, it would be nicer with pita bread, but tortilla chips are a lot more inexpensive for restaurants and easier to keep and prepare. The prime rib itself was well flavored and cooked to order. Very tender, a bit salty in some areas, but overall quite delicious, even better than Weber Grill prime rib. After all this we left completely stuffed. We will be back! They even have 9.99 dinner meal options so check out the website. The last thing is the manager comes over to every table to check up on how the dinner went.Pro: inexpensive, many food options, quick, friendly serviceCons: noneHidden gem:1. Weekend 12.99 prime rib meal. If two people get it you will get a free appetizer per above2. 9.99 meal deals3. Sign up for club o'charley to get a free appetizer coupon with your next dine in

<Content> Called in my order before I left my house and when I got to the restaurant the manager had taken my order and forgot to put it in & was arguing with the employee trying to blame him. There was a reason I ordered my food before I left my house....because I was in a hurry, otherwise I would have ate there. It seems like this place always has issues. If it wasn't for the potato soup..I would not come back. Get it together o'charleys!

<Content> Sam's Cafe was closed, so I had to come here! I was disappointed and underwhelmed to be honest with you. Now I have even MORE trepidation about trying Le Peep (another chain). I wanted some steak so i went with the fresh asparagus (too wilted), chicken noodle soup (salty) and steak (overcooked). I won't be back. I tried to check in here on Yelp and it showed up on my phone as me checking in at Jupiter's. I wish I went to Jupiter's even though I prefer stuffed OR deep dish over thin crust pizza.

<Content> The service here was absolutely wonderful! I took my wheelchair-bound mother here for lunch a few days ago and every single employee treated her like royalty. We have had issues in the past with restaurant and other customer service employees treating my mother like a second-class citizen because of her wheelchair....NOT SO at O'Charleys!The hostess was warm and graciously moved chairs out of the way for my mom's chair. Our waitress as well as three others AND the manager stopped by our table to make sure everything was good with our meal. I can't rave about the way my mother was treated enough. Four days later and she is still talking about how wonderful everyone was. This visit to O'Charleys ensures that my mother and I will return here every time we go shopping in Champaign. It totally topped her day!

<Content> We stopped here yesterday for a late lunch. We were seated quickly and our server was prompt with getting drink orders and lunch order. She brought hot rolls (which are delish) quickly. Then everything came to a halt. After 25 minutes, we asked another server to check on our order. Of course, they brought it right out because it had obviously been sitting in the kitchen for some time. My husband ordered the chicken tenders tacos with a baked potato. The chicken and potato were both cold. I had a bowl of loaded potato soup which was hot and tasty, but it had obviously just been dipped up because soup was splashed all over the rim of the bowl. The group of 4 ladies sitting behind us got their dinners less than 10 minutes after ordering. They were still eating their salads so our order must have fallen through the crack, which is inexcusable when the place is not busy.

<Content> Visited on a busy Friday night with a large party for a wedding rehearsal dinner. Service was fine, meals were A-Ok. The beverage menu looks very much like the one for Ruby Tuesday, which prompted me to look up corporate info. Both seem to have roots in Tennessee, and perhaps have a contract with the same beer-wine-spirits distributor. However it all works, the house chardonnay was good.

<Content> If you're looking to fatten up....then this is definately the place to be. I mean seriously, the loaded potato soup is FATTENINGLY AMAZING! And I do love this place and wish to god they had one here closer to Chicago but apparently they only serve the hillbillies of the world (unless you go to Ohio, because they have 3 in the Cincinatti area!). But in all seriousness, the warm rolls they give you is great, the food is great, the service is friendly and willing to put up with an eccentric city boy like me, and its at an extremely reasonable price. I was going to give it 4 stars because of the locations, but then my mouth started watering when I saw Loaded Potato soup in one of the other reviews, so 5 it is! If you get to Champaign, or any other remote part of the US, check this place out!

<Content> We enjoyed a Sunday brunch just yesterday.I am not a big fan of chain restaurants like this, yet i relented to our youngest's desire for the free rolls.  Service was prompt and not intrusive. I had the prime rib omelet (a little overcooked) with asparagus and mushrooms while others had a burger and fries and roast beef sandwich lunch. All in all, a quick easy meal near all the shopping you can imagine.

<Content> Went with a large group- I received the wrong salad, but didn't want to be 'that guy' so put up with it. Looking around the table, nothing looked that good. KIds eat free- about the only positive aspect to the evening.

<Content> One of the worst meals I've had in a long time, and all I had was eggs and bacon!All the dishes the brought us were dirty, from the small plates that were already on the table when we sat down to the plates our meals came on. Everything was incredibly greasy, I could barely eat the eggs. My dad ordered three scrambled eggs and toast, and he was given eggs and bacon. My mom ordered her meal without potatoes, but potatoes came anyway. I asked for toast with my eggs and bacon, but was given two slices of bread, untested. They couldn't get the orders or cleanliness right. I'd suggest dining elsewhere.

<Content> Had lunch there twice. Meals are not expensive. They have several $9.99 meals all day. And some lunch specials for weekdays. The taste is ok, though a little bit heavy. I like their bread very much. Waiters and waitresses are warm. And the manager sometimes go around to greet every table.

<Content> Being from New Orleans I know what good food is...unfortunately, I have found very little of it in Champaign: that is, until I ate at O'Charley's two nights ago. On the first night, I had the $9.99 Country Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and Broccoli. The food was exceptionally good. My waiter was a big tall guy called "Bird" and provided top quality service. When I went back tonight, I asked if I could sit at one of his tables again because of the great service. I was craving seafood. At Bird's recommendation I ordered the Panko-Crusted Shrimp and Hand-Battered Cod, with a Baked Potato and Side Salad with 1000 island. Again, great service prevailed. Bird brought out complimentary hot rolls and butter. It was all exceptionally good. And I think I am a pretty good judge of fried seafood being from New Orleans. It was the first decent seafood I have eaten in 3 months of being here. The atmosphere is quite nice here, with good music as well, and the resturant was very clean on both nights. O'Charley's may not be a 5 star pricey venue, but it sure does taste like one! Apparently, it is well run, and must have good management and a good chef!  I will be back!

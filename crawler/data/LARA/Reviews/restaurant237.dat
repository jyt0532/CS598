<Content> Management and staff are the best!They bend over backwards to make your experience positive.A great place to study and hang out in a nice intimate setting or grab a quick "pick me up" in the afternoon. I love the cinnamon sugar bagel clusters. (I highly recommending splitting the chocolate chip coffee cake between 3 people to cut down on the caloric intake!) Plus they have fresh brewed black iced tea, and as anyone who has read my reviews knows, I am always on the hunt for amazingly tasty and fresh iced tea.Outlets are more accessible than the University street location which is always a bonus when studying for long periods of time. And it's in a great spot to grab something to eat right before you need to hop on the interstate to rode trip.

<Content> I have visited this location since January of 2014.On average I would say I visit 3-5 times a week.The food is great and the prices are as well.The coffee is really good since it isn't bitter like Starbucks and you pay a reasonable price for it here!If you want a great bagel, sandwich, drink or even a cup of fresh sliced fruit at prices that won't empty your wallet stop by.The staff is extremely friendly and the establishment is very clean.Management really cares about customer satisfaction.The location is located right off 74 (Prospect exit) on Anthony Drive.

<Content> Excellent service and the bagels are FRESH! My favorite is the turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich. When you go there enough, they start to remember your name!

<Content> Unfortunately for my waistline, this location is conveniently located on my way to work. The workers are friendly and efficient, prices are what you'd expect. The bagels.... SO GOOD! I haven't tried a schmear I didn't like...but I can tell you the jalapeno salsa is amazeballs. Especially on the green chile bagel. Holy hotness! Love it! They also have iced coffee priced less than their competitors and I love the vanilla hazelnut!

<Content> My wife and I stopped in here a few days after they opened to give them a try. We visited around 8pm so it wasn't too crowded. I got the 'Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket' and my wife got the 'Turkey Bacon Ranch'. While my sandwich was a tad messy, it was well worth it. We both got meals and it was around $19. A tad more than some of the other sub shops but the quality is worth it. The soda machine is a Coca Cola Freestyle that has like 120+ different combinations of drinks. My wife said the root beer was a tad too syrupy but the regular Sprite was fine. I went with the sweet tea (different machine) which was barely sweetened. One cool thing is they have fire gear from the local fire department hanging on the wall which gives it more of a local feel. There is also a hand-painted mural with a fire truck and what appeared to be the city building in downtown Champaign. Definitely looking forward to grabbing a bite to eat here again in the near future.

<Content> I wanted to like the sub here but it just didnt taste good to me. A big hot damp mess that sat in the bottom of my stomach afterwards like a zombie carcass at the bottom of a well. Nice service and decor though.

<Content> Wow, this place definitely surprised me. It was a lot better than I had expected. I assumed it would be like any other sandwich place like subway or jimmy johns but this was way better. I was most shocked as to the complexity of favors for a simple sandwich. You don't expect that much flavor from a sandwich but this place elevates a sandwich to another level. The amount of meat in your sandwich is more than generous as you get the full mouthful of juicy meat, whereas other sandwiches like subway or jimmy johns you mainly bite into the bread with a thin layer of meat. It almost reminds me of feel you get from an Italian beef sandwich. I got the New York Steamer Sub. I would get the large sandwich as it is twice the size of a medium. Overall I think this sandwich place is great.

<Content> As others have noted, this place is the old Mas Amigos. The food is quite similar to Mas Amigos even though the menu has changed. Many employees are the same, which is to their benefit. I'm proud to say I'm a regular. This place has excellent tacos Mexicanos. The pastor is probably the best I've had anywhere. In fact, everything I've had on the menu has been quite good. Before the switch, this was a great margarita place, with incredible prices. I can't speak to neither the price, nor the quality of the margaritas at present. This place remains my favorite of the Chambana Mexican restaurants. Minor transition issues caused me to give 4 and not 5 stars, but I will revise it upward once the kinks are out.

<Content> Went there a couple weeks ago with a friend from out of town. They had a TON of TVs to watch the NBA Finals game and the World Cup matches in any direction. (Since we're sports fans, it was perfect!)The owner came out to speak to us on several occasions to check on how things were going and make menu recommendations. Food was great. I had the carne asada and my friend had a torta that was so generous in portion size that he took half of it home. Have been back a couple times since and it's been a consistently good time.We were told about the management change and the owner seems like he's eager to receive input to make things customer focused, as well as a spot for locals to truly enjoy. I think he's on the right track...and I'll keep bringing my friends back!

<Content> This used to be "Mas Amigos", but for some reason the name changed. The staff/cooks seems to be the same. The menu is definitely the same.I love their chips and salsa, which are made in house. This is my go-to because the food is consistently tasty, but don't expect sophisticated food. Everything is very cheap.Portions are large (I usually take some to go). I would recommend getting the enchiladas mexicanas. Their margaritas are pretty tasty and just strong enough. I gave it a three because: I think the service is a little disconnected since management change, I had to wait a while for the check and had like 3 waiters. I wish their menu had some variety from time to time. tostadas and queso fresco would be nice :(

<Content> The owners are very friendly and they know how to make the customer feel welcomed. They have many t.v.'s to watch sports. You can tell that the chips are freshly made. The chips they provide don't have a lot of salt, which is always a plus. The food is the one of the best authentic Mexican foods you can get in the Champaign area.

<Content> Ever since the change of owners, the quality of the food has declined. Chips are oily because they refry them using oil that is not sufficiently hot. Salsa that came with chips used to be fresh but now it's more on the brown side than tomato red. Chicken Enchiladas was just so so. - restaurant looked dirty. Acapulco lunch meal was drenched in oil - service was quick and efficient though.

<Content> Honestly, I have no idea how this place is still open. Their food is below par and service is as well. The best thing we ordered was the Lily margarita. The server was extremely pushy, however, he failed to bring us the correct tortillas that we ordered and was not on top of our regular drinks or chips. We ordered a super burrito and chicken fajitas. The food was edible, however, neither item came with sour cream, guacamole or anything of the sorts. The super burrito did not come with any sides. The fajitas did not come out sizzling and looked as if it had just been microwaved. We ordered flour tortillas, however, received corn (which looked old). Had to ask another server for the correct tortillas, which took awhile to receive. The atmosphere was completely chaotic...There was no sense of professionalism nor order to the restaurant. The back wall was not even painted and was just bare drywall. I would not recommend... go to El Toro.

<Content> In town for business and walked to this place from my hotel. It was surprisingly good. I had chile relllenos. The poblanos were fresh and cooked properly. Actually, the waiter recommended the dish. The one downer was the margarita. It was syrupy sweet, which I find disgusting. It was definitely a pre-made mix. I should have went for a corona. Anyway, the cost was very cheap, the chips were fresh, and the meal was pleasant.

<Content> Went here to watch the Colombia vs Uruguay world cup match and the atmosphere was really great, they had a bunch of screens! The food...not so great. The chips they give you for free at the beginning are addicting tho! Im giving it 3 stats instead of two because of that and the $2 Corona special!

<Content> We had lunch carry out today and the food was great, the service was fantastic and I look forward to dining in soon. The chips and salsa are my favorite in town so far, and I am a total chip snob!

<Content> I had a hankering for red beans and rice, and this was the only place in Chambana that I could find. Thankfully it satisfied my cravings AND had really reasonable portions to boot. Red beans and rice, jerk chicken, cornbread, and okra was delicious. I'll definitely be back.

<Content> On Saturdays, they have jerk chicken--it's AMAZING! The rest of the food at this place is ok, but if you go on Saturdays, you can get some authentic Jamaican food. The chicken is grilled to order and served with rice and peas. They will even deliver it if you call.

<Content> This review may be biased because it had been three years since I have Korean food. Regardless, Good Fella serves the best bibimbop I've ever had! I've eaten at places in Chicago that did not serve the bibimbop in a stone bowl, so I never knew that stone bowls kept the dish warm for longer and crisped the rice at the bottom of the bowl. This was, however, the most expensive bibimbop I've had ($12.99) but it's worth it in my opinion.I also had a pork dish whose name I do not remember. It might have been M16 on the menu. It was also very good with lots of vegetables and was marinated in the red spicy sauce.I do not give Good Fella four stars, however, because it was hard to capture the waiter's attention for more tea. In addition, the ventilation in the restaurant is not good so you end up smelling like Korean food when you leave the restaurant.A big plus to this restaurant is that it's the only Korean restaurant in Champaign that has not been subject to a health code violation.

<Content> After frequenting many of the on-campus Korean restaurants, I decided to give 'Good Fella Bistro' a try. A couple of my non-Korean friends had given me their recommendation after trying the hot stone bowl rice dish (bbimbimbop). As a Korean second gen with a mother who never stops cooking, I would say I've had my fair share of GOOD Korean food. But I've also had some poorly prepared dishes in local restaurants around the C-U and Chicago area... as well as even overseas at "authentic" Korean restaurants. FOOD: Good Fella's was the worst Korean food and restaurant service I've ever had in my life. Don't be deceived by their 'mom and pop shop' and 'hole-in-the-wall' appearance. I took one look at my beef-tip soup and knew this was a low-quality restaurant. It was poorly prepared and I knew there were ingredients missing in this staple dish. On a scale of 1-10, the quality of the food was about a 4. SERVICE: It took at least 10 minutes to get a menu, 20 minutes to get water, and our food was served in an untimely fashion. People who had arrived substantially later than us were served first and when we were brought our food, it was SANS rice. The rice was "being made". What kind of Korean restaurant is "out of rice?" Unbelievable. Throughout the evening, we were hardly waited on. It was nearly impossible to get anything refilled. The food was served in an extremely sloppy manner. I had to go up to the counter and bring my own water because the server had just completely forgotten it, along with our forks. TVENUE: The place felt grimy. The door was propped open and it blew over the tall plant inside the restaurant. No one came to pick it up so I literally had to go and replace their plant. Ridiculous. I have a lot more to say about that poor excuse for a restaurant. Nobody should go there and think they're getting an ounce of what a Korean cuisine experience should be.

<Content> Honestly very unreasonably priced for both quality and quantity of food. The service was horrible; I don't know what was up with the lady but she gave such an attitude which made me not want to come back at all. I don't think I will ever return again.

<Content> Feel like the price can be few dollars cheaper but serves pretty good Korean food.Only problem I had is after I paid with my credit card, I wrote down my tip and the total. Few days later, checked my credit card money online, found they took more money. Guess they felt I under tiped them so they just took more money from my credit card WITHOUT my permission. (how legal is this?)I'll probably go back to Good Fella, just probably bringing cash with me.

<Content> Every Korean restaurant has their "specialty"- a dish or entree they are good at making or take pride making. That's the pork belly here. I think they have the best Sahm-guyp-sahl. Pricey for sure but no one beats their quality cuts.Proceed with caution because you have to spend money to get service. That's why I give them 3 stars. Even if you tip well, this place does not care. I don't know how to get the level of service I expect but it just doesn't happen. But yea, the pork belly, it rocks. You stop caring about the piss poor service once you cook the fatty thing on your table.

<Content> When I lived in Champaign, I came here as often as I could. I used to get the ox bone soup all the time, which was heavenly velvet awesomeness, and they had fantastic barbecue. the Kimchi was always perfectly fermented (which there is an art to, my friend), and every side dish I tried there was fantastic. I never ate anything there that I didn't like.On top of that there was a woman working there, I think one of the owners, who always took an interest in helping us have an authentic experience. As one of the few white patrons at any given time, it was nice to feel like we were welcome to partake of their culture, and she consistently gave us advice on ordering and how Koreans traditionally season or assemble whatever dish we were interested in.What I wanted coming in was a mom and pop place that felt like a window into the food and culture of Korea, without being completely inaccessible to an outsider like myself, and that's exactly what I found.That being said, I was sad that they took jajangmyun off the menu before I got a chance to try it. Then again, this is more of a meat place.

<Content> Hands down best Korean food in C-U! Don't let the hole in the wall decoration and location steer you away! If you have never had something before just ask about it. They will take the time to explain the dish to and make recommendations.

<Content> In addition to the owner/cook being a big bully, this place serves Korean food that's mediocre at its very best. It HAS gotten a little better than when it first opened, but still, I've always left Good Fella feeling cheated. I can't think of one good thing to say about this place.

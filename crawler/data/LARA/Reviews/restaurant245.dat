<Content> I love this place. I have gotten many of the dishes on the menu and have never been disappointed. I love the Orange chicken. The egg rolls are awesome. They changed their dumplings a few years back which disappointed me as I loved their old dumplings but the new ones are tasty. The prices are very reasonable and makes for a much better meal than I would get at Panda (the other take-out Chinese on North Prospect). The only problem is location but that is because the parking lot is horribly designed and that is not against them, it is against whoever designed that lot.

<Content> Highly disappointing considering how much the food costs. The food is mediocre and has no taste. I ordered three different dishes (beef, chicken, tofu) and each pretty much tasted the same. Bland. The portions are small. They give you a lot of rice but little meat. Very shady practice. I would never eat here even if it were free.

<Content> The egg rolls are excellent and you can't go wrong with the garlic chicken. Two thumbs up!

<Content> I was reluctant at first, mainly because of the location but this is one of my favorite places to get Chinese in Champaign. It's cheap (meal around $5-$7) and they have good lunch specials where you can get an entree with soup or an egg roll for $5. The employees are really nice and the egg rolls are delicious. The only down side is that they only accept cash.

<Content> Another review from a few years back, really sorry, but wanted to make note of the places I loved when we lived in Champaign.We used to live in the apartments right down the street from this place so we used to order from them by default. That being said I was pleasantly surprised at how clean and nice this little place was. They cooked everything fresh when I ordered and the flavors were good. They were nice and were willing to mess with the dishes a little to accommodate some dietary things. This place was a solid choice for take out whenever I craved Chinese.

<Content> Consistently good food, very affordable, lots of variety. I especially like their egg rolls (hard to find good ones in C-U.) Bo will remember you after a couple of times, too. He can even remember if you don't like green peppers, usually order the orange chicken, etc. Hidden in a little strip mall by Culver's, I think it is one of Champaign's hidden secrets.

<Content> Neck-and-neck for my favorite Chinese in town. Fast and fresh and very reasonably priced. I've paid twice as much for general chicken elsewhere, but it's not as good as at Best Wok. Great egg rolls, too.

<Content> Excellent Chinese food, fast, and friendly staff. The food at most other places in town doesn't measure up. This a diner atmosphere, which is typical for most Chinese food places, so it's not a date night dining option.

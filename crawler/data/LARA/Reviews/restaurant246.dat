<Content> If you don't have cable and you really want to watch a sports game; especially ones that don't involve Chicago teams, this is the place to be. Most mom 'n pop sports bars will always have all their channels on a Chicago team that's playing. Buffalo Wild Wings has a wide array of TV's to cater to all sorts of sports fans. The only foible is the fact that they don't put on closed captions for any of the channels. It'd be nice to actually read what the announcers are saying. The food is your standard fare for an American place. I usually go with the build-your-own burger. The burgers and fries satisfy, but don't completely fill you up.

<Content> I am not going to say that I receive excellent service always. I think it really depends on the mood you show up in. I have been to this restaurant at least 50 times. Super Bowl Sunday and Playoffs is one of the servers hardest days/nights. They are working double the volume of service. I have had excellent and poor service. But, out of 50 times, I have only been disappointed once. Unfortunately the poor service is the part people always want to write about. I think the food has always been great. I usually get my wings, original, naked, zing-sauce on the side.  Because the chicken really has great flavor and the sauce is a little much if they serve it wet..  This place is known for bar food munchies and not elegant dinning... So, with that in mind the service is always fast, cheap, and food is great.Well, tonight was a little different. The bartender has. 1/4 holes in her ears (from plugs I assume). She was rude, and made rude comments at least 4 times to different customers that had been paying a tab for 2.5 hours.  I wasn't offended because I wasn't directly involved. But, I could tell that the comment offended the buyer. Here is what the guy said innocently to the punk rock bartender with gapping ear lobes.  "So that's a cool tatoo, is that Harry potter?" No answer. The customer then asked. "I'm sorry did that offend you? ". Bartender "your face and presence offends me".  And there was no laughter. If you alter your body and society asks a question. Isn't there an appropriate answer? Or at least a comical outcome for the sake of bar-tending?  I have lost a little respect for bw's. And I'm just observing..  Beginning this review I initially punches 5 stars. After tonight's visit to champaign Buffalo Wild Wings, I have lowered it to 3..

<Content> Had the appetizer platter and some chips and salsa. The wings were good but the nachos need help. They use a cheese sauce and cheese sauce, to me, is just gross and salty. The Chipolte ranch dipping sauce was very good. I certainly did not go away hungry.Our waiter was very nice and quite efficient. The place was clean and the bathrooms were super clean. I don't usually go here so I am not sure if that is out of the norm or not.We were greeted promptly at the door and seated. Our waiter was right there and got us a couple of beers and took our order. Our order came out as expected. I have no complaints and having a clean bathroom is a super plus!!

<Content> You shouldn't type things when you are pissed off, so I'll try to be as objective as possible. Hostess - fine, food - good, server - absolutely terrible. It was pretty simple, our server didn't do her job. I have no issues leaving great tips, but she deserved no tip. The only reason I give her a measly 15% is so I didn't end up on Reddit being shamed by society. She didn't remove any of our appetizer plates, she didn't come to see us if our food was good or even right until the check came, the check was split wrong, didn't ask us if we needed any boxes, and my friend paid with cash didn't even get her change. It wasn't even busy, which surprised us because the 49s and Seahawks were playing.To make matters worse when trying to flag down the on staff manager, he didn't acknowledge us and when we walked past us to another table, his eyes were bloodshot and looked completely loaded or high. We decided to cut our losses and get out while we were still "ahead."Maybe if the manager would stop flirting with his servers and teach them customer service, this place wouldn't have such bad reviews and would be more busy on a big game night. I'll be driving across town to the BBW in Savoy, which I have never had an issue with.

<Content> Worst BDubs I've been to. First I will start with the good: they seem to do a lot of charity, which is awesome. We got handed a flier that if we included with our check they would donate 10% to whatever the charity of the night was, pretty nice of them. Now to the real: Our server was so very overly attentive at first. We could tell he was working for that big tip. The thing I did not like, but my bf did not mind: our waiter sat down at our table to talk to us....I could see right through it. He actually asked us if we had seen any good movies. Now, I totally get wanting to be friendly and have a conversation with your table, but I was not there on a date with the waiter, please leave! then once we got our food we never saw him again..... dirty wing plates, napkins piling high and EMPTY BEER GLASSES hellooooooo can we get some service. It was so bad we almost found a mgr or someone else just so we could pay and get out. Then our waiter sat down at a table NEAR us with people who seemed to be his friends for a while. So, it's not like he was really busy with tables, he had time to chill in plain sight of the tables in his section. The whole time he was sitting there we were just trying to make eye contact with him so he would come over. We just wanted to pay and leave. The food was fine, it's a chain so it is all the same. Well actually, the Asian Zing sauce was not as good as I've had at other bww if that is possible (no zing). Gonna try Hoots next time for my wing fix.

<Content> We were in Champaign visiting and wanted to stop for a good quick bite not knowing where to go and believing all BWW were the same. NOT! The place did have some people but the staff seemed very unorganized, and not very clean. The carpet had an odor too. The Manager popped out for a minute or two but quickly disappeared into the back. Let me be clear that our waitress was very nice and efficient but the food was horrible. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, my friend ordered some wings. His wings were dry and tasteless. My pork sandwich was the worst pork I have ever tasted. It was lumpy, overcooked and tasteless. So after trying for a few minutes to the attention of the male manager who looked right at me as I was waving and he walked away, I finally saw my waitress and who was apologetic and offered to replace the mail. I thought ok, I was hungry and thought to give them another chance. So a few minutes later out comes a cook with my meal. Although it was better but not by much.No manager to apologize, no offer to discount my meal or offer a free appetizer, no nothing! I will visit BWW again but not this Ever Again! If I could give it no stars I would.

<Content> This is just a review of the place for trivia. They have NTN trivia, with a good game that starts at 7:30 and lasts till 8:30 with multiple rounds, categories, and scoring schemes. It features a good mix of questions that become more difficult as the game progresses. If you do not make the maximum points wager at the end of the game on the final question, I do not respect you.A word of warning, however: if you perform too well at trivia at this location, you may attract the attention of a certain member of MENSA who isn't shy about telling people she is in MENSA (like many MENSA members, I find). She will want you to join MENSA, so you can pay money to hang out with folks like her. What is an anagram for awkward?

<Content> Few franchises have the honor of being college anti-munchies food. Ever since I discovered the BWW here, that number has gone up by one for me. A nice break from the simple food joints that Champaign loves to love; once in a while, the corporate-smeared spicy garlic buffalo wing sauce is exactly what one craves.I'd also like to say that BWW has participation as a campus venue. Frequent wing-eating contests and even a tournament in the Greek system solidifes my opinion of BWW in this location as a 5-star Chambana location!

<Content> I would like to rate 5 star for any restaurant that I really want to return. For BWW, I love their new dry seasoning wings! They just remind me my college life... However, I have to rate it 4 star because I only want to go there on Tuesday, when there is a discount on those wings.

<Content> So I'm visiting Champaign from out of town and asked where the best place to go would be to watch the USC vs ND game. I was pointed to B-dubs as the best choice due to the excess of tv's available and a more moderate noise level than most Champaign sports bars. The experience was a nose dive from the start. We got our table quickly and the waitress was nice enough. After ordering my drink I requested that my game be put on on the tv directly in front of me. At that moment the tv was showing figure skating, of all things, and of the 50+ screens in the place none of the others had my game on. Simple enough request. 10 minutes later, still looking at men in tights twirling on ice, fail. Asked another waitress to put the game on. She smiled and said she would handle it. 10 minutes later, still getting my eyes burned out of my head. Fail!At this point I give up, I'm not an ass by nature and won't get aggressive. I settle to watching updates on my iPhone. 20 minutes after that, one of my friends (who is also not from the area) points BEHIND me and asks if the tv behind me had my game on. I turn around and sure enough..they had put my game on..on the wrong freakin tv! FAIL!To top the experience off, two of the meals ordered to our table were wrong. And half of the meals were brought a full 20 minutes before the other half..one of which was a salad of all things easy to make. I was going to give 2 stars despite all of this cuz I'm a b-dubs fan, but unfortunately I had decided to try out their "Desert Heat" wings tonight. No flavor, no heat, their mild sauce has more kick..yet this flavor is over the halfway point to their hot sauce. -1 star for not appropriately labeling this sauce..I wanted my face to melt a bit while trying a new flavor. FAILURE!!!

<Content> I like this place. I go at least twice a month. Of the year and a half or so that I've been going, they've messed up my order twice. The first time, they gave me a 50% discount. The second time, they charged my card more and so they gave me my meal free. (I then got my incorrect amount refunded back to my card) I was pleased with how they corrected their errors. I love the boneless wings and the mozzarella sticks!

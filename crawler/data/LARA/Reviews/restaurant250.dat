<Content> I LOVE KK Chicken. Their corn on the cob. DELICIOUS! If you haven't. You're missing out. Would have given them 5 stars. But one day their corn tasted off. Caught me off guard. So I don't know. But the chicken was good as usual. I was sad the corn ( Main reason I go ) was terrible. But I still like this place a lot. I'm hoping I won't have a bad experience with the corn again. We'll see next time I go.

<Content> Decent restaurant, food is good. I got there when it opened so food was fresh. Try the fried corn!

<Content> The chicken is hot and delicious, but it does have to be freshly fried. Call ahead for some of the best chicken in the area.

<Content> Ok, went here last night for dinner. I think that this place is owned by the gentleman who run the liquor store on the end of the strip mall. The chicken was fried fresh, but It's no better than the chicken that I fry at home myself. it was just OK. I do find it odd that they opened this JUST before the popeyes is due to open soon. No competition what so ever.

<Content> The Chicken and biscuits are delicious. It's worth a try. It reminds me of Church's chicken, found in bigger citys.

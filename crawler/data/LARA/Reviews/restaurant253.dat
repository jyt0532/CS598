<Content> Sadly, this place is closed. It was great while it was around. I think a lot of us would welcome it back!

<Content> You won't be getting bone marrow or gorgonzola cream sauce burgers, just a white bread bun, a perfectly cooked burger and maybe some cheese, lettuce and onions. Simple, delicious, and super inexpensive: I got a double cheeseburger and it ran in the $3.50 range.Downsides: it's a food truck so the winter can be pretty brutal, even just waiting for your food to cook, and it's cash only.

<Content> Ah, Derald's...for an entire semester I saw it looming there on Mathews but never had the courage (or classes nearby) to try it. As stated, it's basically a truck which the owner sells various foods out of the side. When you first walk up, you immediately are greeted with a friendly "Hello," and at almost the same time you are overwhelmed by the amount of food that they offer, and to make matters worse many of the specials are written on taped-up pieces of paper all over the windows.Oh yeah, the food is pretty much great. I've only had the fish sandwich and the steak sandwich, but I can already attest to the overall deliciousness. The fish sandwich is phenomenal, I almost never eat fish-only fried, and it's craveable. Two HUGE pieces of crunchy fried fish covered with tartar sauce, vinegar, and onions (get everything, you wuss.) Unfortunately it's only on Fridays, and they do run out towards the end of lunch, so make sure to stop over quickly! Prices are pretty affordable, especially considering the amount of food that you get, and tax is included.

<Content> Derald's is a popular fast food place and they do business from a small truck. They are located near Mathews Ave and Green St and another is at Mathews Ave and Springfield. Burgers are made-to-order and they are cheap.The fish burger (only on Fridays) is one of the best I have had but I don't think they use really fresh fish. It tastes really good with tartare sauce, onions and vinegar.

<Content> I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet. Everything that I've had here has been delicious. At first I was skeptical seeing that it was a food truck, but don't let that fool you. Highlights are the fish sandwich, which is available on Fridays, and the bacon double cheeseburger. The daily double is great if you're going for breakfast, although it can be a bit on the heavy side.If you like fish sandwiches, you will love the one at Derald's. If you like your food on the spicy side, ask for the cajun fish sandwich. It's the standard with a dash of cajun spices and hot sauce. My mouth is watering thinking about it.Prices are very reasonable and comparable to what you would spend anywhere else on campus. There are daily lunch and breakfast specials which are a great deal as well. On top of everything, the owner, Eric, is a very nice guy and great to talk to.Side note: Derald's has a diner on First and Green, and while I haven't been there yet myself, I've been told they have fish sandwiches everyday.

<Content> I honestly don't know why everyone says this is the best fish sandwich. All the native Champaignians say this, so maybe it's just home-town pride or nostalgia? Anyway...Of course I got the fish sandwich. I didn't enjoy it, and I love fish sandwiches! It was pretty flavorless, and the tartar sauce/vinegar combination didn't please the palate. I've heard some people like it with hot sauce, and I think that might help, but my sandwich shouldn't have to be soaked in spiciness for it to taste good.

<Content> As good as it gets for short-order fare. Left 2 years ago, but there were two trucks...one near the Union on Mathews, and the other by Grainger Library. Great breakfast fare...I would get sausage, egg, cheese, light mayo on Texas toast. Delish, and maybe $2.75 or $3.00. The burgers and fish sandwiches are tops, as are the specialty ones, esp. the bbq pork. Don't pass this up - you haven't graduated from UI unless you have eaten here. Go to the trucks...I was less satisfied with the location in the law school, and I think the one in Ye Olde location at 1st and Green is no more.

<Content> I passed by this truck so many times on my way to class. Each time, I dared myself to try it. But I was scared. I'd never ordered anything from a truck before. What if I look dumb? Do they take credit? What if they only serve construction workers? Now I've eaten there several times. I'll give you all the facts.1. OMG YUMMMMMMMMM!!!!2. No credit- only cash :(3. did I mention OMG YUMMMMMMMMMM!!!All their breakfast options are amazingEven the black bean burger is greatIt did make me feel like I would probably raise my cholesterol significantly...TIP: Call in advance, on your way from class. They take a little time to get you your food. But if you call earlier, they usually have it ready for me after the 10 min walk over there.

<Content> Fish sandwich. It is the best in town. Lightly fried when you order, comes with onions, tartar sauce, vinegar. It is so good and worth the price.The menu changes day to day, but there are some things that are always on the menu. Each day there is a special meal, too. Everything I've had has been really good - the cheeseburgers, the steak and egg sandwich, the egg and polish, and the barbecue chicken sandwich. It's cheap and it's really good - consistently. The fish sandwich is the king, but it's all good. (Not a place for vegetarians, though.)The service is always friendly and pretty quick. They only take cash, which can be inconvenient, but it's worth running to the union to get some cash for these sandwiches. And you don't need much because it is so cheap.They now have donuts, too, from the donut stand at Springfield and first. Oh, the years I wasted walking past this place and not ordering.. don't make my mistake!

<Content> Fish sandwich with tartar sauce, onions, and vinegar. I don't even like any of those ingredients but I simply cannot get enough of this sandwich!!! I think it's the perfect crunch to fish ratio that gets me... I can't vouch for anything else but I only wish the fish sandwich were available every day.

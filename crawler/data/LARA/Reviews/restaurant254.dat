<Content> Is Bonnie Jean's still around? If so, then you need to check this place out, they have AWESOME pizza and calzones here. I believe it's takeout only, it's on the 2nd floor of the building. I wish I were still a student, once I found out about Bonnie Jean's, it was my go-to place for pizza. It's good for dinner, and also is/was open late-night after the bars. There was always a long line after the bars closed though, so prepare to wait since they make everything fresh. Calzones were HUGE. Pizza was always cheesy with lots of toppings. YUM.

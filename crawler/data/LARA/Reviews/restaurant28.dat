<Content> I passed by this place after work for months before one day deciding to stop by on my lunch break. I got the fish sandwich and fries. I was pretty happy considering it was under five bucks and really good. I went back and tried the chicken a bit later...As I bit into that chicken leg, OH. MY. WORD! This is my new favorite place, what with their great prices and good food. What brought me back, though, was the two guys who work there. They're friendly, courteous and when they said "enjoy your meal," I really felt like they genuinely wanted me to enjoy my meal.Today was the third time I went there and I tell everyone in the breakroom at work how good this food is. Definitely worth a try if you're contemplating it.

<Content> Since moving to Champaign from Chicago, I've really come to miss what I would call the "greasy brown paper bag" restaurants. A paper bag filled with a mess of fries and sandwich that are so greasy they leak right through, leaving a dark stain on the bag.When I came into JJ Fish the first time, I felt like I was back at home in Chicago. The people inside waiting for their food were talkative and friendly, the guy behind the counter was a bit of a jokester with a sly smirk and a warmth to his demeanor. The air was thick with fried chicken, fish, and grease.For $2.99, I got a freshly-cooked fish sandwich served up hot with cheese, tartar sauce, and a whole mess of fries. The food was very tasty, but wasn't anything terribly special outside the context. Given the price, though, and the fact that I got to have a humorous conversation with the cashier, it made it worth coming back a week later to do the same. Later, I'd like to give the chicken a shot, since it seems to be what most everyone else in there orders. They must know something I haven't yet discovered.A slice of local Chicago culture a hundred miles outside the city limits.

<Content> Been wanting to check this place out 'cuz I miss the fry-up places in Detroit and Chicago. Big JJ is pretty dang good. I got the catfish fillet sammie. Tasty fish, a tad on the thin side though, covered in a cornmeal batter. Everything was right about it. I'd for sure come back when cravings for fried chick'n or fish overwhelm me.They have a decent list of sides, and since I somehow didn't notice fries came included in sandwich price; ordered the fried okra. Yum! Can't go wrong there. Had enough leftover fries n' okra to share pre-dinner "apps" with some housemates.Prices here are super reasonable. It seems mostly a take-out business, as there is very little seating. It's a tad shabby 'round the edges, as a good you-buy-we-fry shop should be. Counter guy super nice and friendly.

<Content> Phone in your orders because they're cooking your food to order.My last year of undergrad, I called in so many times the guy knew my voice (when I changed my phone number, he still recognized me).I could eat a half dark meal every day.

<Content> These mutha-suckas! I ordered chicken and it smelled like it had been cooked in Pennzoil. I returned it and shared that they needed to change their oil because it's old. The smurf behind the counter quickly became agitated, and told me it was NOT burnt. I never said it was burnt, I told him it was old and they shouldn't serve carcinogens to the public.He became furious and started slamming things and told me to get the F@ck out. I remained calm, which wasn't easy and told the manager, his brother, I would be happy to leave once I get my money back. I also explained that I was going to tell all who would listen about how poorly I was treated and never support this chicken shack again!! Please drive past these disrespectful, poultry hooligans and do not support their business,

<Content> I surprised my girlfriend (from northern Italy) on her birthday with dinner at Bacaro. The atmosphere is very nice and sophisticated. We were promptly seated (we had reservations) at a beautifully set table right by the window. For starters I ordered a negroni and she had a glass of white wine. We then ordered our meal: pizzetta with zucchini and burrata as our antipasto, bucatini and fusili as our primi, and salmon and scallops as our secondi. The appetizer was a little underwhelming, not enough burrata in my opinion. The first plates were very, very good and reminded us both of Italy. There was however, one issue: my girlfriend's plate of fusili came with a hair on it. We told the waitress and she immediately took care of it and was extremely apologetic - very professionally handled. Our second plates were even better than the first. The salmon and scallops were cooked to perfection and left us both wanting more.We finished the night with a caff corretto (on the house). They also gave my girlfriend a birthday present of chocolate dipped biscotti which was very thoughtful and a nice finishing touch to a wonderful night.The unfortunate fact that we got a hair on one of our plates and I am still leaving a 5 star review should speak volumes about this restaurant's quality of food and service.

<Content> You guys. Did you know you can buy bottles of wine retail (to-go, unopened) at 50% off?? You can. The bartenders will chat with you, let you sample, give recommendations, etc. That's not even the best part.The best part, of course, is the food. Bacaro is, by FAR, the best restaurant in Chambana. No doubt. The food is refined and delicious, the service is impeccable, and the wine list impressive. I'm sure the cocktails are great, but I've never bothered. It's true- they are pricey by Champaign standards, but Bacaro is worth it. Go.

<Content> This restaurant is sort of hit and miss. I have had some really spectacular pasta with sea urchin. And some fairly mediocre short ribs. This is one of the best restaurants in the area but it wouldn't hold up too much competition elsewhere

<Content> Full confession. I have never been here for dinner, which is the main draw if this restaurant. I went on a Friday afternoon, when they simply have one item for a little lunch special. Well, sweet Jesus it was awesome! This particular day was the Ciabatta bread sandwich with fresh mozzarella, real garden tomatoes, pesto, and cucumber salad for side. $12 including a drink. So good! Get over there and give it a try.

<Content> yeah... so what, I have only eaten here twice. Like there could be a bad meal from this spot. Staff is awesome, all of them. Front of house, back of house, big props. I have had food that I had never had (black truffle risotto) , and I have had things I have had before (grilled octopus and pork cheeks!) presentation, quantity, ambiance, vibe, wine, champagne. This is a comfortable yummy spot. When I get my duck in order, I will eat out a bit more often, and well... I can't wait.done shun

<Content> Tasting menu sucks. Totally overpriced. Tried several things:- Cauliflower soup: It was okay.. very creamy and not too much cauliflower taste.--------------------------------------Two stars. How did I never know anything about this place when I went to school here forever? Maybe I came here once for a drink.. I can't remember anymore.What a delightful spot with outdoor seating so you can enjoy the summer nights.First.. Sunday is half priced wine days... yum! The Pinot Noir was the favorite amongst the Syrah and Malbec.Second.. the cheese plate was heaven. How delicious! You have to try their jam and the bread is pretty good.We also tried a few things for dinner.. the risotto and pig cheek pasta dish. The risotto was decent but the pig cheek dish was good with a hint of chili.For dessert we tried the ice cream cake which was yummy but quite small. I heard the panna cotte is heaven but they do not serve it anymore because it's been on the menu for a while.. WHAT?!! I know...Overall lovely experience.. I hope they put the pana cotte back on the menu. This is definitely fine dining in downtown Champaign... it's growing up slowly but surely.

<Content> This review is extra late. I came here with my friend when he was visiting from San Francisco. We came the Monday before Thanksgiving and had a reservation, although they were not busy. We had their Market Monday menu since it was Monday. It had a very Thanksgiving theme to it, but my favorite was the beet salad. We also had wine pairings with each course and they were all pretty good, except for perhaps one of the wines. I don't remember which wine it was since this was so long ago. Overall, a nice, quiet dining experience.

Issues with food service reservations etc. Then Rose (asst mgr) came to the rescue. Within a few minutes everything was made right. Loved Bacaro before, love them even more now. Definitely will be back. Rose was simply amazing!

<Content> This place was a bit of a disappointment for me. I was really excited to try it since I heard the chef was an apprentice of Iron Chef Mario Batali (yes, I love the Food network).The service wasn't great, and even though it seemed fancy, the decor wasn't all that great either.The food is expensive (which I was expecting), but the pasta that I got was pretty bad and for some reason tasted a lot like bacon (which I wasn't expecting). Don't get me wrong, I love bacon, but not when it doesn't have bacon in it and isn't supposed to taste like that at all..I definitely wouldn't go back here, but it was an interesting experience.

<Content> Pretty good food but a bit pricey for what you get. Compared to higher end restaurants in Chicago the food here isn't really that expensive and the quality is generally very good. However, there are many places in Champaign which both cook well and charge lower prices as well (usually ethnic food though).Seating is limited and parking can be difficult to find but there's really no doubt that the food served here is the best in Champaign.

<Content> I wish I could give Bacaro five stars. To be fair, there's a lot to like about it. The quality of the ingredients is high. The ambience is great too. The servers are among the most professional in the C-U area. The food is genuinely sophisticated. However Bacaro's commitment to local, seasonal ingredients, while being one of its strengths, is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The menu at Bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock. This tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing. Of three visits I've eaten some bad, ok and great meals.Visit 1:Had halibut with some kind of crust in a mint-gazpacho. The fish was fresh and of excellent quality. This was frustrating however because the fish was coated in a greasy crust that became soggy from the fish sitting in the mint gazpacho. The gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty. What could have been a complex, herbaceous broth, wound up tasting like greasy mouthwash. Fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep.Visit 2:Valentine's Day prix-fixe. Three courses all of which were delicious. The appetizer was some kind mediterranean type salad if I recall with olives and I think preserved lemon. Delicious and fresh! My main was halibut again, with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey. My girlfriend got the steak and it was of great quality with a strong preparation to match. The dessert was a chocolate torte with blood orange sorbet- good flavors that were well-executed.Visit 3:Pork loin with mustard spaetzle. The spaetzle were delicious! I could eat that spaetzle every day. The pork however was DRY. Really, really dry. I was trying to conserve the mustard sauce on the plate in order to make sure there was enough to get on each slice of pork. It was that dry. So in closing out of three, expensive visits, the food has been good maybe 1.5 times- with me being able to say I enjoyed one complete meal (valentine's day) and the side of one of my mains (the spaetzle). If the food was consistent, Bacaro would be an easy 5-stars. Hopefully they can strike a balance moving forward between rotating fresh, seasonal ingredients and maintaining a consistently-executed menu.

<Content> This is the perfect place to stop in after a longday of visiting family and friends. Not too noisy, good food, and any beverage you like. We didn't order entrees just appetizers and salad. Theystill sent out an Amuse-Bouche and sliced baguette with olive oil. Nice. We wish we would have been hungry enough for a full dinner but we had been eating all day long. Next time I think I will budget my stomach space and leave some room for Bacaro. You should too.

<Content> Great atmosphere. Very well prepared food. Exceptional service. The roasted cauliflower is super delicious; my husband doesn't really like cauliflower but loved it. He had the scallops which were perfectly cooked; they came with "scalloped" potatoes (mashed potatoes formed into sea scallop shapes) that were nicely crisped on the outside. I had the duck but I can't remember the sides, so maybe it wasn't so memorable.They also make their ice creams in-house (as any restaurant of this caliber should).Highly recommend Bacarro for a nice evening out or when you have guests used to finer dining.

For the main course, the Smoked Potato Gnocchi was AMAZING and the Wild Striped Bass was very flavorful! The wife enjoyed the bass thoroughly, but we both agree the smoked potato gnocchi was the winner! Nice atmosphere and friendly staff! We will definitely come back!!!

<Content> Our favorite restaurant in Champaign. Service is great and very friendly (apart from one server we had last fall who has, thankfully, seemed to have left). Food ranges from very good to amazing. We've never had a bad meal at bacaro.You can throw down a lot of money here, but you don't need to. The bar is great, they have reasonable and interesting wines by the glass, and you can have a few appetizers or smaller courses and leave without spending too much and but still feeling like you had a special night out.Highly recommended.

<Content> I had a lovely anniversary dinner here a few years back. I remember the pumpkin ravioli being delicious and the waiter service being great. Portions are relatively small, though. I love that they use local ingredients and keep their menu small and creative. They are very active on FB as well, so follow them if you are interested in seeing their weekly specials in photo form. Because of the prices, we didn't go back, but if we made more money, we'd definitely have gone back at least a few more times!

I also loved the risotto, it was amazing! The overall ambiance is beautiful, altho it was a tad bit loud. The service was excellent. The prices seemed relatively fair, but on the more expensive side for restaurants in Champaign. Overall, definitely recommend it for a romantic date night.

<Content> Who would have thought that I'd pick a place in Champaign for my 600th review!... Well, Bacaro certainly deserves it: I finally went there for dinner last night (after wanting to go for several months), and I was wowed. I'm still salivating thinking about it.I went there with pretty high expectations (I'd heard great things about it from several friends and coworkers): that's usually not a good thing as it makes it easier to be disappointed, but Bacaro did not disappoint. In fact, I'm happy to say that my dinner there was on a par with my best dining experiences in NYC.First and foremost: the food. My boyfriend and I decided to share a bunch of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, as well as the roasted suckling pig with homemade sauerkraut: they were both absolutely delicious (don't miss the suckling pig!). We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding. That was some seriously great food!!As Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty good. Not to forget the 10yo port we got with our dessert (very generous pour...), which was good also.Service was great, ambiance was great (although it's a shame that the place was so empty)... it was really a great dinner (sure, it was not cheap, but entirely worth it!). By far the restaurant in Champaign, in my opinion. I'll definitely be back.

<Content> The best restaurant in Champaign-Urbana if you don't mind the price.Sometimes the dishes "try too hard" to be unique and modern; I'm all for molecular gastronomy and modern cuisine (even tried some in my kitchen) but the combination has to work. Chocolate cake and bacon? Not as good as chocolate cake without bacon.

<Content> What one would consider fine dining - especially considering the fact we're talking about Champaign - Bacaro's boasts of an extensive wine selection and the best of traditional Italian cuisine. We ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, and, because I wasn't feeling very adventurous, chose the oven roasted chicken as my entre. Overall, I found both these dishes a little too salty (maybe the chef was just having an off night?). The portions are modest, but you would probably expect a little more for the price you're paying. They did have a decent cheesecake and the check came out with a couple yummy chocolate chip meringues, but overall I guess I was a little disappointed.In consensus with what many others have said, service was very attentive, but I felt it was almost to the point of pretentiousness. Based on this experience alone, I would most likely not recommend Bacaro's nor dine here again, but I really don't want to dislike this establishment and would like to come back again sometime in the future and give it another chance. Until then, I say stick with Radio Maria.

Crammed seating.It was crazy expensive, I understand local farm products, different menus, blah blah blah..but in Central Illinois? Seriously, $28 for a chicken leg? No thank you. The prices were a turnoff and the food was OK, maybe we picked the wrong dishes. The whole time my date and I were staring at this couple that did the at the time $98/person tasting menu...one YOUNG lady and a very old man... and they were a riot so I guess we had fun watching them.

<Content> Bacaro has been through some subtle but incredibly effective changes. I am happy to say it has taken back it's rightful spot as both my favorite and simply the best restaurant in town... and one of the my favorite spots anywhere. As I mentioned previously the decor and staff are superb, but Chef Thad Morrow is now to be seen frequently in the dining room, and is doing a much better job of maintaining food standards than than the previous Maitre D'. Food is now flawless, and portion sizes have increased somewhat too, which for most was a welcome change. There is also a new Bar snack menu, which combines comfort-food with nouveau twists, like spicy homemade pork crackling! Bacaro could compete on a world stage, and do very well.

<Content> I have NEVER ever had a bad dish here. The service was always so spot on, but then again that might just be because they know me.I am always impressed with the ideas Thad's crew thinks of...and I am such a fan of ANYTHING the dessert Chef Allison makes, that girl is incredible!Sure it is pricey, but it is mostly local products, which makes me more than happy to fork over more. They seem to be particular to detail, which is a plus to me!The wine is top notch too.Honestly, anyone who finds Bacaro pretentious must be insecure, or needs to be more social. Good Lord, fine dining people!! You pay for what you get.ALSO!! Thad has also mentioned to me how he likes his business to have less seating so its about quality, and not quantity. RESPECT that!!I think I need to save to go there again, so worth it!!

<Content> Haha, came to review this place and realized I reviewed it four years ago, when I ate the admittedly boring student prix-fixe. Hopefully they don't do that anymore. Since then I move to Stockholm and then New York City. I was back in the area for a few days and decided to try Bacaro again. It was really very good. Yes, despite the fact that there is a lot of mediocre food in the area, it's not the area's fault. Champaign-Urbana has fantastic terroir. There are many producers nearby making food that is world-class and Bacaro uses these ingredients to great effect. I LOVED the goat cheese salad and my rich creamy risotto. Fried sweetbreads were luscious. My boyfriend's chicken with chicken liver was delicious. I guess the only complaint is that the prices here are the same as in NYC...

<Content> I always love Bacaro! This was actually my second time here and it was such a nice evening in Champaign, that our party of 4 asked to sit outside even though our original reservation was for the inside and the staff was very accommodating.The wine is half price on Sundays so I had 3 glasses. The Pinot Noir was delightful and the Cab Sauv was decent as well.With wine, we had a cheese plate with 5 cheeses and plenty of bread.For dinner, the risotto with rabbit was tasty.Dessert was a red velvet ice cream cake. It was okay. Bacaro used to have a panna cotta that was memorable to the point where, it was the one item I truly wanted to have again when returning to this spot. Oh well, maybe next time.Overall, a great spot for good food and drink.

<Content> I rather enjoyed Bacaro. It had a really nice atmosphere, quality food, and good wine.I was impressed that time was taken to talk to my wife and I to find a wine to pair with both of our meals. The pairing was correct and the wine went well with our meals. It was somewhat amazing also the fact that it wasn't a very expensive wine that was suggested.This is a very good place to eat in the Champaign area. The reason I gave it 5/5 (instead of 4/5) is because even though the food is a little over priced in my mind, the service, atmosphere, and location lend to it receiving a 5/5.

<Content> Have eaten here MANY times over the years, from when it was just a panini joint to just the other day. I think this place's most inventive time was its best time, about 3 years ago, maybe a little more. Food items are less adventurous and price point has increased with time. That said, the desserts under their pastry chef of the last year or two have been TOPS. Service I have always found to be very good and knowledgeable, esp. about wine. I am curious to see how the metamorphosis of the former Persimmon Grocery into a mozzarella bar (is CU ready?)/wine lounge/private dining salon will go.

<Content> Decent food, but not spectacular. The grilled watermelon salad sounded better than it actually was -- it was drenched with vinaigrette... Anyway, I had the scallop dish, which was cooked nicely... but slightly bland.  I think the wine here is better. had a really awesome special pinot grigio with literally peaches floating around!!! It was so great. I have to come back here to try more of their wines. I think it's probably better to come here just for wine than for dinnerAnd like what everyone else said, the service was great!

<Content> My only complaint was the waitress was a complete moron. I am very forgiving of servers too, being a former one myself. She had no idea what was good on the menu and just kept saying "Im a vegetarian." With that being said, in Champaign, I haven't had a better meal. I had the veal and it was wonderful. I can't recall much else but in a town without much choices other than the usual college fare, this ranks up there.

<Content> Flavors were generally ok, but the pork and rabbit were overcooked and the scallops weren't seared properly. Also, the portion sizes were a bit large: we'd have preferred more quality and less quantity for the price.Update: we returned a second time to a much better meal. The lack of consistency should be a big concern for the owner, though.

<Content> If you want to be treated like garbage at a pretentious overpriced "whatever" of a restaurant then go. My recommendation is avoid because there is way too much attitude here. We were greeted rudely when they learned we did not have a reservation.... On a freaking Thursday.... In a college town! We walked out, so thankfully they did not get our money and we had a wonderful meal just two doors away.

<Content> I am a huge fan of high end restaurants and since discovering my addiction I've been trying all of them within reasonable driving distance of my home. Bacaro is one of the most upper-endish restaurants around, so I had to give it a try.I liked the atmosphere, very modern and mood-setting, and the staff was nice. The food however was just a bit too out of the ordinary for me. I prefer classic dishes done to a high standard over the creative and stronger-flavored inventions they had here. I found the food more interesting than delicious, which in the end left me a little disappointed.If your palette is bored, adventurous, and experienced you might like Bacaro, I'm not quite there yet.

<Content> FANTASTIC!I've been wanting to go to Bacaro for awhile, but my husband and I have been too busy. We finally made time last night.Atmosphere: 5 stars. Great atmosphere, dimly lit, very nice.Service: 5 stars... we found the service to be extremely high caliber without being snooty. We ate at NOMI in Chicago a few weeks ago and the service was comparable. Quality and Kind... just the kind of service we adore.Food: PERFECT. I'm not a "foody" but I adore good food. The octopus was the best I've ever had. The gnocchi was incredibly savory. My husband tried the steak and I had the lamb special. Both were FANTASTIC. Wine suggestion: 4.5 Stars. Wine was good, not great. I'm not sure if we failed to describe what we wanted. Would be nice to have some descriptions in the wine menu. We've been to several nice restaurants in Chicago that provided descriptions of at least a subset of wine choices. This is such a minor point though.We did not eat dessert as we were stuffed.I can't say enough good things about this very very special restaurant. I'm just disappointed we took so long to finally get around to eating there. We will be back... this is now my favorite restaurant in Champaign Urbana!!

<Content> Food was excellent but did not have a great experience with waitress. Table of 8, we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings. Wine came out about 10 min after our food on a few courses which left us unable to experience the "pairing" as you should. We politely and discreetly asked her to bring wine out with or right before food and I think that ticked her off. After that, she was aloof, barely explained the wine or the dishes we were being served. Water was slow to be refilled. The real kicker was the 20% automatic gratuity she added after tax on our bill! When we asked to speak to the manager, she told us " he's busy dining with a client". Say what??? I believe your customers are your priority! We asked a different waiter to see if he could find the manager and low and behold, out he came! Tainted our experience and maybe our waitress was just having a bad day but when you are dropping that kind of money on dinner- you had better train your wait staff on how to properly serve and deal with customers. It was a shame because from the chef end- he did a great job of making delicious and interesting food- it's just too bad no one explained it well or delivered it professionally.Just wanted to post an update. We received a very kind letter from owner/ manager apologizing for our experience and gave us a generous gift certificate to try them again. We definitely will give them another chance. Again- the food is amazing and we want to see them succeed.

<Content> I enjoyed my meal at Bacaro, but I have a hard time justifying the price. On the whole, the food was very good, but the overall experience fell short of my expectations for other dinners of similar quality that I have had elsewhere.  First, the atmosphere of the restaurant, while nice, did not strike me as anything special. That said, this could be a product of where I sat.  Even though I placed a reservation close to a week in advance, I found myself sitting at the table nearest to the kitchen with my date. While she had a view of downtown Champaign and the restaurant's interior, my own view was of a row of temperature controlled wine racks and a junky-looking electrical socket near the kitchen's entrance.   For the appetizer, we had the pizzetta, which didn't strike me as anything special: just bread, cheese, grape tomatoes, onion, and bacon.  Our entrees-- the braised rabbit and the grouper-- were better, but as others have mentioned, the portions were quite small, even for a restaurant focused on contemporary fine-dining. Thanks to a bottle of wine and a second helping of bread, nobody left hungry, but with the final bill clocking in at close to $120, it was hard not to walk away with a sense that some of that money could be better spent elsewhere.     Ultimately, in giving Bacaro three stars, I am rating it in the context of other "fine-dining" establishments. The restaurant's chefs clearly know how to cook, and their wait staff is very well trained, but I don't think that either the food nor the space warrants the price that they have set on it.

There were some trepidations from my party, as ingredients found at Bacaro were uncommon, but with the server's help we all were very pleased with our orders! Also a great wine selection topped off the evening- also ordered with the staff's assistance. Awesome place!

<Content> I had the 6 course tasting flight tonight at Bacaro and it was incredible. My friend and I ate and drank wine for 3 hours, and I felt completely taken care of but not intruded upon by our totally awesome, knowledgeable, helpful waiter the entire time. 100 thousand props to said waiter, who didn't give the check to my male dining companion just because there were two of us and my male dining companion was male.I can't agree with the other reviewers about the portions; I was FULL by the end of the third course and still had half a meal to go. I think if I had even just ordered the linguini that was our 3rd course I still would have been full.This is definitely a special occasion kind of restaurant, but I will certainly go back if I ever have a special enough occasion again.

<Content> Hmmm, what to say, what to say. I came here for dinner the other Sunday night, place was quiet but very nice in terms ambiance. The menu was very nice. The service was excellent. The food would have been good, even excellent except the chef was very heavy with the salt, every dish was salty, excessively so. Not enough to send it back but one more grain of salt and I would have refused to eat it. My companion suffered the same fate. The wine list was either very expensive, they did not have it or Slovenian, not sure what's up with that. We ended up drinking beer because we could not find anything we liked. I'd give the place one more try just to see if perhaps this was an off night.To the other raves comparing this place to the top restaurants in NY or Chicago I would say "oh please"! It was good, showed promise of things possibly greater but comparing it to a dozen places I could name off the top of my head in either city Bacaro was good but at these prices it should have been better.

<Content> Bacaro (pronounced bah-kah-roh') is a trendy little ultra-modern wine bar. The food is largely excellent, though portions are modest. Bartenders and waiters are generally quite knowledgable about the huge selection of wines they have, which is a great plus. And prices are rather reasonable, though not great.Perching yourself at the bar for half-off wine and some dessert on Sunday night is a great way to enjoy the ambiance of this hip little place.

<Content> Went here for dinner in February 2011. Extensive wine list, great service. Food was not so great. I had the duck dish for app and monkfish for my entree. both were too salty. Maybe it was just that day? Also kids who wail/scream should not come to wine lounges! (the rest of the crowd was fine, just these two kids who sat at the table next to us...)I would probably go back here but just to try the other wines...and sit at the bar.

<Content> Bacaro serves refined, restrained, beautiful, absolutely delicious food. If you are looking for fine dining in Champaign, this is the place to go. I've never eaten anything there I didn't love, the servers are friendly and knowledgeable, and something about the atmosphere is soothing.Thad Morrow is an asset to Champaign and this is a restaurant to be appreciated. I love the way they use their produce here and tend to gravitate toward the vegetable dishes. The staff definitely makes the effort to work with local, quality and seasonal ingredients when possible, and it pays off. The flavors are bright and fresh, and Bacaro completely honors the quality ingredients it sources. What more can you ask for in a restaurant? The prix fixe Market Monday menus are always a treat. And when I can't splurge on a full dinner, I enjoy popping in to sit at the bar with a glass of wine and a small plate. I can't even name the Bacaro dishes I have enjoyed the most--everything I have eaten here, from the soups to the salads to the pastas to the entrees, has been a pure pleasure. The kind of food that makes you say "ohhhh god" after every bite. For Central Illinois it may be a splurge, but I'm telling you, eating here is worth 100 meals at Destihl or Radio Maria or Seven Saints or Guido's or any of those other totally mediocre downtown restaurants.Bacaro also seems unpretentious. It's definitely upscale, but I feel completely comfortable going in there in jeans and moccasins and unbrushed hair. (...Or maybe I'm just an oblivious slob.) Oh, and maybe this is irrelevant for a restaurant review, but I have to mention that once I was there the night a guy proposed to his girlfriend, and the restaurant sent out glasses of champagne to every customer in there. You also get amuse bouches before dinner and little homemade dessert bites with your check. I love touches like that.My one complaint is that it's harder than it used to be to get a good boozy cocktail here. There used to be some talented cocktail guys behind the bar. Recently I went in and ordered a Manhattan, a totally standard cocktail, and the bartender had to look up the recipe in a book. So I stick to wine and resign myself to the fact that you really can't get a great whiskey cocktail anywhere in Champaign-Urbana.For me the ultimate test is: If this restaurant were in Chicago, a city full of fine dining spots, how would I rate it? Without hesitation, Bacaro would get five stars.

<Content> I went for the first time on a Wednesday. I agree with the previous review that this is the place to go for fine dining in Champaign. The wine list was excellent and extensive, probably has the best wine selection in Champaign. Dinner was all-around great, as was the service. The food was fresh. Yes it may be a splurge for the area, but coming from Chicago, it was nice a very nice find.

<Content> I can't help but feel this Restaurant has fooled many. While I've read the food described as "Authentic Italian," I felt it was anything but. I've been to Italy, and this ISN'T Italian...I suppose the entire visit was lackluster. The decor had a lot to be desired, but the wait staff were great. However, once we ordered wine (and, by the old menu at least, were supposed to receive the standard 4oz glass) things went downhill. While we were savoring the tiny portion in our glasses, the bartender was doing his best to overfill the glasses of the pretty girls at the bar. When questioned, we were told "they asked for doubles." Who orders a double Merlot? We chose what appeared to be a special at the time: a smoked duck panini. What arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. No, I'm not complaining about the sandwich itself, but they had substituted ham instead of smoked duck, then claimed that I wouldn't know the difference. I'm not sure if it was just this visit or the one that followed that biased me, but I'll never return.

<Content> I'll confess that after nine years I never took the time to sit down in Bacaro for a meal before last night. I always preferred Radio Maria, Escobar or some other place for a nice meal. So before we set out on a Friday night for Bacaro, I decided to Yelp it and I was (and still am) very suspicious of a few of the reviews. Here was a place with lots of 1 & 2 star reviews and yet a couple of 5 star reviews, written in great length and gushing detail by Yelpers for whom this was their only review. So who writes their first and only review in great length and never mentions anything they ordered, just summarizing it as an excellent restaurant, then never subsequently reviews any other restaurant? I may be a cynic, but it raises red flags....So, we set off to do our own independent research: Three people on a Friday night. The place is full, we get one of a couple of available tables, with no reservations. The waitress was wonderful. My first requirement to enjoy a restaurant experience is good service, and she was great. She knew the menu, she was unequivocal when we asked her what she liked. She kept her distance and watched us for cues, never interrupting a conversation and never rushing us nor ever making us wait.The wine list is huge, the drink list is equally huge, but both are very pricey by Champaign standards. My wife's martini was a very full glass, all the way up to the "c" section as we Assembly Hall fans would say.We had a risotto special with fish "for the table", one mixed green salad, and one fried pork belly starter. The pork belly was $10 and was the size of a large marshmallow in the center of a 12 inch plate, humorous by its dinkyness. But good, like a chunk of fried bacon fat.Then we had three entrees, all were very good. Mine was the grouper ($28) and frankly I don't recall my companion's meals because we also knocked down one martini and two bottles of Cote D' Rhone between the three of us. The Cote D' Rhone was $28/bottle and the lowest price wine on the list. Several other wines could be had in the high $30's, and then the rest of the list was north of $40.One apple pie ala mode later and the three of us were out of there for $192 before tip; and she was worth the $40 tip we left, so by the end of the day it approached $77 per person.So if you start a Yelp review at a three, this place gets one more star for having a great server, one star for being in DT Champaign and being beautiful inside & out, including cloth hand towels in the loo. Then I'll knock one star off for being too pricey for the market, but if Yelp allowed half-stars I'd give Bacaro 4.5.

<Content> I can't complain about the prices. The food was expensive; the food was good. There was presentation to the entire experience, which is something I've found a little lacking since moving to Champaign.I wouldn't want to eat in the bar area on a Saturday night, and if the hostess hadn't been able to move us into the other room we would have had to leave. My dad can't hear very well and his hearing is better than my lip reading. The bar area is really nice and I'd love to eat there on a Tuesday, which I have.The good: The food. Three people, three different dishes, and everybody liked theirs. I had the halibut and mom had the rabbit, and if you're going in there soon, I'd recommend either, and even more I'd recommend the vichyssoise with crab and asparagus. If you're hardline vegetarian (I eat fish) then you'll have problems with the menu, but I believe the waitress at least implied that the chef would make allowances/prepare something else? Either way you should call ahead and see. I have no complaints about oversalting like other reviewers, perhaps they listened? The malbec we drank with dinner was a nice random choice.The bad: Our waitress was new. At least I hope she was new. The service was great but she wasn't as familiar with the menu or wine list as someone working at that caliber of restaurant should be.The manhattans were terrible. I suspect Bacaro of being yet another restaurant who thinks they should have their own special manhattan, with exotic bitters and cherry juice and... do you think you're going to save me from scurvy or something? I want bourbon, bitters, and sweet vermouth, and go easy on everything but the bourbon. This is no time for creativity.The dessert menu is stupid. Who follows octopus and rabbit with banana bread and ice cream? Hire a dessert chef.I would totally recommend Bacaro if you need "fancy dinner out." Sometimes I do. Sometimes I have parents who need impressing.

<Content> Bacaro is often spectacular. Outside of Daniel, in New York City, I don't think I've had food this subtle, refined and exquisite anywhere else - something I don't say lightly, as I am well aware I'm talking about a restaurant in Champaign, Illinois. Yet, we have such a restaurant and it's a shame we don't trumpet it more.The pros:The service. The staff is exceptionally well-trained, smooth, and (almost) flawless.The dishes. Creative, never boring, always executed well. And also always worth it. The attitude. Everyone at Bacaro takes operating a restaurant seriously. Bacaro is professional to the core, and proud of it. So, seats aren't ripped, napkins aren't fraying at the edges (even slightly), dirt hasn't built up in corners, the decor isn't allowed to grow stale, the food never leaves the kitchen unless it's up to very high standard.The Chef buys locally - and has for a long time.The decor. Modern, it's visually interesting without feeling "cold." Love the bathrooms and the cloth towels.Location. Downtown Champaign is always fun.Their tasting menus. Spring for it and try one. They can be food revelations.The cons:A lot of people in C-U are unnerved by Bacaro. I've had friends and co-workers describe it as "too fancy," "too elite," "too cool" for them (I disagree, but what can you do with someone's insecurities?) That dismissal shows up in other reviews here, too. The dishes. Sometimes all that creativity is just too much. Even though they're really, really good, it's sometimes hard to get geared up for appetizers like "fried watermelon" and "popcorn with truffle oil."

<Content> I was so incredibly disappointed. I love gourmet food, and I thought I was going to get some pretty good, gourmet italian. I had to wait over an hour for my reservation, our water was never refilled, and the food was very over-priced. I paid almost $30 for the ribeye steak which was the worst ribeye I have ever had. If you want ribeye, go to Jim Gould's. Their mashed potatoes were very much like the kind you make from a box. After I ate there, I went to kofusion for dessert.. it was THAT bad. It is also so small. There are not even 10 tables in that restaurant, and I can not even believe they are still in business. I was so pissed after eating here, that this restaurant is the reason I made an account on yelp.. to tell you all that it sucked.

<Content> I felt decidedly underwhelmed and overcharged.The chocolate cake was the only item that I consumed that lived up to the expectation or the quality implied by the pricing. The soup was merely OK and the spaghetti completely underwhelming (bland, in a runny sauce) and a huge disappointment. I also felt that I was missing a spoon to easier roll the spaghetti in, and I don't really see the point of being given a knife instead. Finally the Malbec I ordered (by the glass) simply shouldn't be on the menu in a fine dining restaurant.To complete my negative experience, everything on the menu was 2 to 4 dollars more expensive than the already high prices posted on their "sample menu" online.  To be fair, the service was fine (although not extraordinary) but obviously couldn't compensate for the rest.

<Content> For the price that this Central Illinois establishment charges, one would expect basic restaurant treatment. I waited for 15 minutes even though I had a reservation. The host was a snooty, inconsiderate person to which I told him, "relax, this is Central Illinois, there's nothing to be snooty about." And most importantly, the food was over priced, did not taste good and the portions were small. All in all, not the greatest.

Portions are a bit small, but if you're going with appetizers and dessert the amount of food will leave you full and happy without being too stuffed to leave your chair. The waitress made a great wine selection to go with our food. The restaurant isn't very big, the decor is modern. A good place to go on a date if you're willing to spend the $.

<Content> I've been here three times now, and I have to say, it's gotten better in the year or two since it opened. Yes, they still pour meager glasses of wine, but the wine menu is great. And yes, the food isn't really *really* Italian, but it's pretty delicious, whatever you think it is. The first time I went, the risotto was mushy, too wet, and way to cheesy. But today, wow. Just ... wow. The ONLY place within 200 miles that serves burrata. Please order the burrata. What an outstanding cheese. My ribeye was also very good, seared and perfectly medium. Tender and fatty. Yum. My girlfriend's ravioli, topped with truffle, were also delicious.Give them a try. I think especially in a town with very few fancy food options, this is a real treat.

<Content> First off, the chef's mortadella and creme fraiche didn't amuse my bouche. Second, my gnocchi tasted like it came out of a Bertolli bag in the frozen section at a supermarket and the sauce was inundated with salt. After trying some parmesan, which was freshly grated (about the only positive), and pepper flakes, I realized that nothing could save the dish. If you want to pay Chicago prices to impress a date, you can try Bocaro, but don't expect more than oversalted Champaign food.

<Content> another great experience last night at Bacaro. Over the top with wine and interesting food. I did the chefs choice starting with an incredible assortment of meats everything from house cured proscuitto to blood sausage and veal sweetbreads. We moved on to a great salad of raddichio and goat cheese with hazelnuts, a few more really incredible plates-A great atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff

<Content> Simply put, this is, by far the best restaurant in town, and one of the top 5 in the state. I eat out a lot, and I always look forward to eating here. I actually had the single best dish I have ever had in my entire life here, and same goes for the best dessert I have ever had.I also like that the menu is never the same twice. While I do have a favorite dish a some places, I always know that it is going t be an intelligent, pleasing, and not over sized meal. This is a place that I go to before I go out, and I like that you can eat and function after. I like the decor. I have read a few reviews that did not like it, and I do understand them, but I love the Danish modern look. It was done tastefully, and with some thought.If I have one complaint it would be that when I am there I can't decide what to get. Small menu, but you end up wanting everything on it. I lived in Chicago for many years so I had a LOT of great food around me, and I always made a point of going there.

<Content> I just went to Bacaro for my girlfriend's birthday and got some mixed feelings about it. Here's what we ordered:Grilled veal chop with red beets and pearl onionsGrilled sirloin with red cabbage, potatoes, and braised oxtail, in a red wine reductionApple cake with creme fraiche ice creamChocolate brownie with graham cracker ice cream and roasted marshmallowsPersimmon and pistachio bread puddingThe entree and wine were splendid, although a bit on the salty side for the sirloin. However, the dessert left a lot to be desired, in particular the persimmon and pistachio bread pudding. It was just plain soggy and tasteless. I recommend not ordering dessert here if you do plan on coming. In regards to the waitress and hostess, they were very helpful and courteous, in contrast to many of the other reviewers who saw them as "snooty" and pretentious. The atmosphere was pleasant and the ambient music was suitable for the occasion.

<Content> Bacaro is very "hit or miss" -- there have been times I have loved my food, and other times where the food has been average (but has been expensive!). Overall, it is a consistently good restaurant in terms of service. However, there are certain dishes that are more tasty than others. I would definitely recommend trying Bacaro at least twice in an attempt to determine the types of dishes you like and don't like.

<Content> One of the few places in Champaign to test your palette. next to cafe luna, i would say this is the perfect place to escape for excellent wine, food, and dessert. Thad is serious about his menu and you feel it when you experience his creations. Libby always recommends the absolute perfect wine for every course...don't even bother trying to compete with her pairing knowledge. The food is rather smart and inventive. the interior is very reminiscent of blackbird in chicago.

<Content> My partner and I went here for our anniversary and got the chef's tasting menu + wine pairings. It was probably the best meal I've ever had. Every dish was perfect, and every pairing was perfect. I've never been for a normal dinner off the menu, but I probably will eventually. I'm happy and impressed that a restaurant this nice exists in this little town.One complaint, and not really their fault: A few times now I've walked past to see people in bright orange Illini sweatshirts and other "lay-on-the-couch" attire eating dinner. I can't believe someone would go to such a nice place dressed like that! Put on a tie, son! Or at least a button up shirt. Maybe Bacaro should have a dress code.

<Content> I don't see what all the fuss is about. I lived in Chicago for many years so maybe I'm spoiled. I don't mind paying $27 for a steak but the steak I had was average at best and one of my friends had a rabbit dish that was just okay. Third friend had a seafood risotto that was the best of the three entrees. The entree selections were very limited and tried too hard to be different or unusual.Waiter was nice but new I would guess because he seemed nervous. Not rushing back any time soon.

<Content> Cannot say enough good things about Bacaro.When I was a student at the University, my (now husband) and I would go here for anniversaries and special days, and he even proposed to me here! So I must say that although I have emotional bias, my love of their service, ambiance, wine and FOOD remains true.We love their innovative cocktail selection, and wine pairings (which the friendly and knowledgeable staff helps you choose if you would like).I love their Market Monday dinners using local ingredients and varying week to week.But most of all I love their totally original, one-of-a-kind, tasting menu (literally the chef does something different every night!). While it is a bit pricey, it is more than worth it for the quality of food and overall experience (you would pay double if they were in Chicago and not Champaign).I live in Chicago now and Bacaro is definitely on par with any James Beard or Michelin-recommended restaurant in the city. I just wish I had more so I could come to Champaign (just for Bacaro) more often.

<Content> Bacaro is a restaurant that I would reserve for a special occasion....or just to treat yourself to something a little different. My favorite is the Market Monday prix fixe menu with ingredients selected from the saturday farmers market. to go from fresh local ingredients on saturday morning to a full 5 course meal and wine pairings by monday night is pretty spectacular. The last couple market night meals that i have been to have been around 40 dollars, and for an additional 25, you can get some awesome wines (highly recommended). The courses are so elegantly prepared with amazing presentation and you won't go home hungry. I've noticed the dishes are a little too salty for my taste... actually, they're consistently salty to me (but then again this is coming from someone who barely ever salts their food) but i think you can get around it by indulging less in the amazing sauces. and the desserts-- so delicious. the desserts truly capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly. I honestly don't know a better way to start the week! if you have a bad case of the mondays, treat yourself to some bacaro. and your spirits will be lifted. I have gone several times and enjoyed several of the menu items, and a few market nights (i hear they're introducing an occasional VEGETARIAN!!!! market menu!!) and i have never been disappointed. The service is great, and they are very attentive. Some servers are more knowledgeable about the wines and others know a little more about the food and preparation, but overall, they are a pleasant and fun to talk to group. If you ask them a question and they don't know the answer, they are probably equally curious to know the answer as well-- meaning they will find you an answer even if it means hounding the chef :-) I think you definitely get what you pay for. and for a city like champaign, bacaro is definitely a lovely gem.

<Content> I only gave it five stars because I can only give five stars. I was in town for 24 hours, it probably will not return to Champaign again. I wish I could take this restaurant with me on the road. It was a pleasure to have this restaurant available in the middle of Illinois. The scallops and pork were delicious. The grilled octopus salad is a must. Portions are not huge, but adequate. In my party, one person have the ribeye. It was fantastic. The other person had the grilled salmon and it was equally good. All in all this restaurant must not be missed.

<Content> Whether you are interested in local, organic ingredients or simply enjoy delicious food, Bacaro will not disappoint. 5 of us had a fantastic time at this restaurant last night. We shared a couple of appetizers and entrees and everyone loved every dish we had. The resounding favorite was the octopus appetizer which was tender and flavor- full.  The beef tenderloin was charred nicely on the exterior and was cooked to a perfect pink. The seared scallops with Myers Lemon were refreshing and light. The gnocci was a showstopper as was the risotto with black truffles and the duck breast. We asked Thad, the chef, to choose a bottle of wine based on our menu selections which enhanced the experience! The entrees run between $25-$32 and makes a great choice for a special occasion.

<Content> Had dinner for the first time at Bacaro. Waitress (Daisy) did a great job but assumed that because we had not eaten at Bacaro before we wouldn't know what a "tasting menu" was about (not necessarily her fault - could be the result of patrons she deals with in this neck of the woods). We ordered the Roasted Beets and Scallops Mousseline for starters and the Sturgeon and Yellow Fin for dinner. The tuna was really good and the sturgeon was excellent till the penultimate bite, when I ran in to a big chunk of salt. That eliminated the last bite. We did order a bottle of Pinot Noir and that was good as was the flour-less chocolate cake. As for the appetizers, the scallops were really good; the beets were okay - didn't really taste anything but the beets; the truffle beet chips did taste good. There was some confusion about our reservation but I think the confusion involved a new staff member. Service (Daisy) was excellent. It would be nice to experience the taste of some of the other ingredient in every dish coming through.

<Content> A M A Z I N G. I'm originally from NY and was visiting the area. This place blew my mind it was so good. We chose to do the tasting menu which was about 6 courses, complete with a cheese course and dessert. I paired it with the wines too. The wine list was definitely impressive. Lots of interesting wines at very fair prices. They are considered a wine bar, so I was hoping for a good list. But I was impressed with the prices, there were many bottles on the list for under $30 which is always great to me. It's easy to fill a list with great expensive bottles, but it is indeed very difficult to pick a variety of great wines at reasonable prices. The wines paired perfectly with each dish, I was so happy. About the food... I was just so impressed. The octopus over german potato salad was unlike anything I've ever had, and just so delicious. Yes, it does sound strange but it was so well done, and the octopus was cooked just perfectly, it was so tender. I was so thrilled the chef has decided to include this as one of the courses. We had a big scallop seared and served over corn salsa which was almost sweet but just delicious. We also had braised rabbit, which again was tender and also quite flavorful sitting in a pool of broth, with some tomatoes, and homemade pasta. The rib eye for the main course was flavorful and again very tender. The cheese course was fun. And I loved thin very rich slice of chocolate dessert. To be honest, I was simply amazed at the quality of these dishes. Sure it is a more expensive dinner out, but for the quality and caliber of the dishes, it is a steal!! This is easily one of my most memorable and favorite dining experiences. Easily 5 stars for Bacaro!!

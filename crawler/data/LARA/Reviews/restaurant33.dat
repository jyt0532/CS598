<Content> Papa Murphy's is cheap and I can make it at my convenience at home. Can't argue with that.unlike most other pizza places the size of their pies has not shrunk over time to try to garner more profits but the prices have gone up, but I can get an easy to modify pizza with a variety of toppings and they don't charge me an extra $2 per change like some other places.Yeah, it's not instantly hot and I have to cook it at home but that is what makes it so you can get a huge pizza for the price of a tiny pizza from pizza hit.Papa Murphy's has a life long customer in me.

<Content> Costs more than Papa John's and is kind of a hassle to have to bake it when you get home. The bake it yourself thing is supposed to be a tradeoff for keeping the prices down so it kind of defeats the purpose when you can get a baked pizza cheaper somewhere else. Plus, you can only bake one pizza at a time (and trust me, if you ignore these instructions, you will regret it), which is really inconvenient.The service is very slow and the kids working there aren't people you want sticking their bare hands all over your food. Yep, that's right. Even though there are diced vegetables, cheeses, dough, and meats to handle, there is not a single plastic glove to be found. Ick. Today, my pizza was made by a girl with tattoos all over her hands and arms (including a lovely one of a topless woman on her forearm) and facial piercings. Now, I have nothing against personal expression through tattoos or piercings or whatever, but this girl just looked DIRTY. Watching her mash her hands all over the the dough of the pizza I was going to eat made me want to run out of there, but unfortunately I'd just forked over about $35 for two small pizzas and salads. To top it all off, I was in the place for almost 20 minutes due to the very slow and inept service.I used to go here frequently when it first opened and found it to be a great deal wth great service. I hadn't been in for a year or so, and I really wish I'd stayed away.

<Content> Pizza in the CU seems to be an overall disappointment. We like Papa Del's, but it is pricey and takes forever to deliver, and although we like Jupiter's and Timpone's for a good thin crust, they are more involved than a simple good delivery or quick bite.Stepping into that gap, my wife and I find Papa Murhpy's convenient and tasty. Their veggie delite is great. What I like about the pizza is that the toppings are good, particularly the ample fresh veggies. One of their pizzas has a garlic sauce that we also like.Maybe it's just me, but these pizzas seem much less oily and overall slightly healthier than what we get when we order out, and of course in baking ourselves get second to none freshness.So, we've had great experiences here and really enjoyed the flavors, and also feel that we've ate (slightly) healthier and saved some money. It also doesn't hurt that we're a mile away and we can grab one on a trip to Schnuck's.

<Content> Wonderful bake-it yourself pizza. My friend and I always get the vegetarian and it comes loaded with all the usual veggies and ample cheese. There's a gourmet vegetarian option with artichoke hearts and spinach that's great as well. They have good fresh salads and cookie dough for sale also. Service went downhill there for awhile-they had some downright sullen people in there who used to get upset with us if we came in a half hour before closing, because they were wanting to clean up for the night. But those employees seem to be gone and everyone is very nice again. Prices are very reasonable and the food is of high quality. A winner!

<Content> Weird idea but the product itself is pretty good and priced right. Worth a try. There really are advantages to take-and-bake. It's ready when you want, you can slice it anyway you please, and theoretically you could bake half today and the other half tomorrow. Look for their coupons or specials and try it yourself.

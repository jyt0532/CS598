<Content> Xinh Xinh Cafe is known as *the* place for pho in Champaign-Urbana, and that reputation is well deserved. We've visited several times over the last two years and had almost every menu item. Every pho we've tried is absolutely excellent. Indeed, it is still good after travel time if you choose carry-out. But I recommend eating in. The decor is modern, as others note. It is pleasant, with lots of stainless/aluminum. But is is not oppressive or alienating in any way. It is simple fare in a restaurant with a relatively simple decor. (Perhaps exotic to Americans, but pho is really a simple dish in Vietnam.) They serve dishes other than pho. Our favorite are the bahn mi sandwiches. Serving sizes of the pho are large, sometimes more than we can eat depending upon how hungry we are. The bahn mi sandwiches, however, are small. When I was in Vietnam we became accustomed to them using a half baguette. These are about six inches long. BUT... bit but... flavor is the best I've had in many years. Every visit the service has been exceptional. They are attentive and take your order very quickly, and they keep your drinks, even water, filled all the time. They are quick to bring extra or different kinds of hot sauces, soy sauce, oyster sauce, etc. if you ask. They lack a web page, but do have a small and not greatly informative facebook page. To me, that is not a substitute for a real web page, preferably one with a menu. When you approach you feel a bit cheap going to a strip mall restaurant. But the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff quickly make up for that.

<Content> Mondays they have $5 vermicelli bowls IF you pay cash. I don't like places where you need to tip but they don't actually serve you. The guy who was working just brought us the food and that's it. I'd say take out if you can, it's cramped and air is blasting brr!Pho is aight, it used to be better a few years back but if you're not picky with pho then go for it. Bahn mi sandwiches are also just okay- I always get a tummy ache when I eat those, not sure why. I rec the deep fried spring rolls, those are my fave thing there (these also used to be better a few years back but still good!)

<Content> I had the worst of luck with Vietnamese food this past weekend, but I decided to give it another go since there was hardly anything opened on Memorial Day. I ordered the bun thit nuong cha gio and Kenny ordered bun nem nuong cha gio. We also ordered a watermelon bubble tea drink. The flavor of the bun dishes were on point, but I was slightly put off by the cube-shaped meat in my bun thit nuong. What the heck was that all about? I've never had it prepared that way, so in the end, I traded dishes with Kenny. The nem nuong flavor was on point as well, but the meat was cut way too thin that you could hardly taste the flavor at all. The cha gio were delicious, but I wish they were a bit more fried... The egg roll skin disintegrated too quickly during the meal, and that's not appealing at all. Then the worst offender of all: the watermelon bubble tea. We wanted real watermelon, damnit. It was a hot day and we wanted something refreshing. This watermelon-flavored tea drink with boba in it was disgusting as all hell. We couldn't take another sip after one or two. It was that bad. Kenny and I actually thought that we had ordered the watermelon slushie, so when we looked at the menu again, we found out that the slushie wouldn't have been that much better-- it would have been the same exact thing in icy form AND it was more expensive. What the hell? Eww, gross. Luckily, we came during their happy hour and so the price of our meal didn't cost as much as we thought it was going to cost us. Still, I was disappointed to have yet again wasted money on sub-par Vietnamese food.

<Content> Kind of pricey for lunch, but I hear they have great diner deals. I'm not a big fan of the pho price, but the flavor is pretty spot on. I do wish they would put more meat into their stock given the big price and the big noodle bowl, but I'd take the authentic flavor over quantity. Toppings are usually lacking as well. They give one lime wedge, a few sprigs of basil and a good tablespoon full of bean sprouts. That's it.Outside of quantity, the flavor is decent and worth going out to eat for.

<Content> Found this place via Yelp on our way to Marion IL. Easy to find, about 1 mile off the highway. Place is packed with students from the school around. Great selections of your typical Vietnamese restaurant. Pho tastes great and I ordered the rice plate which is not bad. Price is a bit on the high side and service is pretty good. Very friendly. We will be back if passing through again.

I ordered pho and my boyfriend had a vermicelli bowl - both were very aesthetically pleasing and delicious. We also had the shrimp cake summer roll appetizer, which I would strongly recommend trying!Overall, great price, food, and service. Will be back for sure!

<Content> Growing up fairly close to one of Brooklyn's Chinatowns I had easy access to authentic Vietnamese food whenever I wanted. I came into Xinh Xinh not knowing what to expect- how good would Vietnamese be in Central IL?Turns out, it's great! I had the dac biet (Go with this pho- you get beef slices along with all the other fun cow parts like tripe and tendon) and my girlfriend had a banh mi. My pho had flavorful broth (watery pho broth is the worst) and the garnishes were fresh and a good portion. I was really impressed at the quality of my girlfriend's banh mi's bread. Banh Mi is all about the bread- when you've had a good banh mi you know what I mean. We also shared an avocado shake, which we both really liked.My only real gripe, surprisingly enough, was the price. I guess it's hard for Xinh Xinh to get some of the ingredients they use down in Urbana but believe it or not I think the pho in NYC might actually be cheaper and a larger portion (eg, the dac biet here costs about as much as xe lua in NYC [xe lua is like a giant portion of dac biet]). Nonetheless, I'll happily come back! Plus my price issues are really mitigated by the fact that they take 5% off if you pay in cash and they have pho happy hour on Wednesday.

<Content> It's a bit past 9pm on a Saturday night and I call Xinh Xinh to see if they're still open. I've never been, but I'd heard good things, and I had a hungry crew of people from out of state to take care of. Closing at 9:30? We can make it...Good thing I did call, because they were about to close up shop early for the night. It's a small place owned and run daily by one guy (Shai), so it's a forgivable practice. Just make sure you call ahead if it's near closing time.We felt a bit embarrassed coming in, but Shai made us feel completely welcome and we never felt rushed at any point in the night. Since we were also the last patrons of the night, he took the time to make sure we were satisfied and chatted with some of my friends who from his home state of California.I've had a lot of pho in my time, but the broth here was much more flavorful than any other place I had been. The meat balls weren't as dense as I'd have liked (that's what she said), but overall everyone was happy with their soup. My one sick friend said she felt considerably better once she finished, so yay pho!Protip: they take credit cards and are open Sundays now. Shai mentioned a Sunday special on Pho, though I don't know if it was just that Sunday or every Sunday.

<Content> I went here with my boyfriend and we loved it! We both had vermicelli bowls and it was DELICIOUS. I'm a huge noodle fan too, and this was probably one of my favorite noodle dishes I've ever had. It came with this delicious crispy eggroll and it all made for a perfect lunch.The only reason it hasn't received five stars from me is simply because that's all I've gotten at this place. I need to go back and try more, but the vermicelli is just so good!UPDATE: Just went back with the bf and sister this past week and officially added another star. The vermicelli bowls are just too good, especially for Champaign.

<Content> I absolutely love the pho! I come here about every Wednesday for $5 pho with my wife. Shred the basil leaves, add the sprouts, and toss in the jalepaneos for a savory broth. Add some sriracha and the hoisin sauce to the small dishes and dip away. Arrive around 5:30pm to beat the rush. Remember cash only for the special. Food arrives snappy, but service is limited. Don't expect water refills, take your cup to the counter and self serve if your thirsty. The broth should quench your thirst though.I've come for the Monday special and it was great, but the pho happy hour on Wednesday is what gets me back. The sandwiches have also been tasty, but pricier.

However, the pho hasn't impressed me yet, and some of the dishes just weren't that tasty.. It's also somewhat expensive for lunch, which is always important for us graduate students.. Unless they wow me in the future, it's no more than 3 stars for me.

<Content> I was a bit disappointed after being a first timer here the other night. My roommate and I work at a Vietnamese eatery back in the city which made us grow a love for their food. Moving down here we were craving a Banh mi and a noodle salad. We were very excited to tryout this new place although we knew it wouldn't be the exact same we didn't expect this.We ordered a lemongrass chicken Noodle salad and it didn't even look like chicken! It had no type of lemongrass flavor in it as well and the noodles were too soggy. When I asked the server if she could please put all of the veggies on a side plate for me she insisted it was impossible and why would I want to do that. REALLY ? Knowing this is the only Vietnamese place around campus makes me upset about my visit here, sorry but won't be back.

Food is great too - Pho, Banh Mi, etc.The only thing i wouldn't recommend is their banh mi sandwich that's coconut milk and ground beef. Something about the flavors didn't settle right, but other than that, The Phnom Penh Pho was fantastic and any of the banh mi sandwiches with radish, carrot and cilantro is a winner!

<Content> After Shai passed on operations to his parents some years ago, Xinh Xinh has recently changed ownership (and is, presumably, out of the family). In the last few years, I went to Xinh Xinh once every three or four months, or even more -- although it is always packed (especially the nights with the $5 specials), I found the quality of the food to have gone down, with lots of shortcuts (unremarked substitutions for the cha gio in the bun cha gio) and just plain missing or weird elements (why did the thit nuong in the banh mi begin to take the shape of nuggets?). I am not sure who is running this place now, or if they plan on making any changes--?

<Content> I highly recommend checking this place out. The food is generally tasty and the staff friendly and attentive. Get a sandwich and a thai iced tea or an avocado milkshake. The pho, on the other hand, doesn't really compare to what I've enjoyed in restaurants on the west and east coasts. I personally think the pho broth here is a bit too sweet, but I know others who enjoy it a lot, so it's a matter of personal taste. If you want to try it, do so during their $5 pho happy hour on Wednesdays from 5pm until closing. Any pho on the menu is $5, which is an awesome bargain!

<Content> After 7 years in Champaign, I finally tried this place out, and I wish I had tried it out sooner. Overall, the food really hit the spot. Every time I ate there, I would have a craving to go back the next day. I always get the pan-fried garlic beef banh mi sandwich. Everything about it is great. The vegetables are fresh, the beef is surprisingly tender and non-gristly, and there is a TON of cilantro on top. The bread is light and airy but has a slight crispy crunch. The avocado shake is also very flavorful and refreshing. Who knew avocado in shake form could be so tasty? Service was prompt...then again, I ate there during the summer months, so I can't vouch for the service during the school year when more students are around. Try this place out...you won't be sorry!

<Content> I woke up incredibly, incredibly sick yesterday, with a thudding headache, achy limbs, hacking cough, and sniffling nose.After dragging myself through a long day of class, I knew--KNEW--I needed a decent bowl of soup. When I was living in San Diego, the best cure for my tiredness and illness was always a big bowl of pho. And I'd just heard that Xinh Xinh Cafe had opened next to the Schnucks. Thank God.The space is a bit small, and has a whole "Chipotle-forced-industrial" look to it, softened with Vietnamese hats and other cultural items. I made a beeline for a nice big bowl of pho and was delighted by the flavorful bowl in front of me. However, it could have used a little more beef.That said, I enjoyed myself very much, and the menu is extensive, and the staff is incredibly friendly. They've only been open three weeks, so you should give them a shot, especially if you're sick and need a big steaming bowl of pho to feel better.Edit: Keep in mind, they don't take credit/debit cards yet. So, just run into schnucks and use the ATM or get cash back.

<Content> Ok everyone will talk about pho because it is like the hamburger of Vietnam.So I'm gonna rave about all the other stuff.1: Shai is hella awesome. He really takes pride in his work and you can tell because when he asks how everything was, he's really asking how everything was.2: Get the freaking Banh Mi. Get the banh mi. Get it. Now. I'm going to assume from the domination of pho reviews that a lot of people in CU haven't been converted yet to this most awesome ambrosia of Asia. It's basically a Vietnamese hoagie (I cringe too as I type that): the bastard child of the French occupation of Vietnam that grows up to be a beautiful, exotic Helen of Troy. A banh mi baguette is made with rice flour which gives a fragrant papery aroma (versus the yeasty aroma of French baguettes), a delicate crackly crust and a softly chewy interior. It's filled with any combination of ingredients that reflect the Vietnamese talent for marrying flavors (who else can make something taste hot, cool, spicy, succulent, crunchy and meaty at the same time?).Xinh Xinh's banh mi is effing great! It's not the behemoth banh mi of SF (which are the size of a Fat Sandwich sandwich) but it's the perfect size for a meal. I'll confess that when I go in, I order five sandwiches. Because this place brings out the glutton in me.Shai changes up the menu as well so there are daily specials and new sandwiches to put into my five-sandwich rotation.For starters, I'd go with the B1 (classic), the beef with papaya salad (different), the chicken (comforting) or... well, you see how this gets out of hand.Moving on before I drool more and short out my keyboard.3.) The appetizers are also awesome. Hands down the BEST spring rolls in town. Yes, beating out any of the Thai restaurants. I'm partial to the pork one that has some kind of wonderful crunchy stick. I also tend to add both kinds of spring rolls on top of those five sandwiches.4.) There is some really cool and unusual stuff on the menu for adventurous foodies. There's nothing more thrilling than finding someone in CU who know's what's up and would rather go balls-to-the-wall than play it safe. I'm talking about the egg soda. Not an egg creme soda. An egg soda. Bubble tea is all well and good but... EGG SODA!!This is the only restaurant that I will trek to Urbana to. On the days when I roll out of bed too late to make it there (they are open til ten pm Mon - Sat), I go hungry because I know anything else will be a disappointment. I love this place. If I could live there and eat their banh mi forever, I'd be a very happy girl.

<Content> When writing these reviews, I know that people can't help but compare our local Vietnamese restaurant to other Vietnamese restaurants in L.A., San Francisco, or another urban area with a greater concentration of ethnic cuisine. Maybe Xinh Xinh doesn't live up to a well-traveled foodie's expectations in terms of "authenticity" or flavor or the size of their pho bowls, but the same criticism could be made about any restaurant in this town (i.e., our best restaurant can't compete with New York's best)...and quite frankly, I doubt many people could shell out $300+ and fly to L.A. just to try your favorite Vietnamese restaurant out there. Ok, rant over.So in terms of restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area, how does Xinh Xinh stack up? The menu might appear limited, given that most of the items are just variations of banh mi (sandwiches), pho (noodle soup), bun (cold noodle "salad"), and rice plates (usually accompanied by some kind of grilled meat). However, there are usually 7 or more combinations of each dish, served with different meats, sauces, etc., so the menu is pretty extensive if you plan to sample it all. While the restaurant didn't start with many vegetarian options, they've been consistently adding more over time, and the servers are usually helpful in pointing out vegetarian dishes on the menu. You should also speak to the owner (Shai), who can tell you about upcoming dates when he plans to have vegetarian daily specials.For appetizers, I really recommend the glazed chicken wings or nantaing (spicy ground pork dipping sauce served with baguette slices and shrimp chips). The chicken wings smell a little funky, but you'll overlook that once you get a taste of them. I love the flavor of the nantaing, and I especially love the sound of crackling shrimp chips when they touch the sauce. I usually order the pate ban mih, though many people complain about the strange "metallic" flavor that is often attributed to pate. If you're feeling a little less adventurous, I'd recommend the grilled pork ban mih. I am also really impressed with the bun (noodle "salad") that they serve. Xinh Xinh's bun has generous portions of meat, bean sprouts, carrots, and lettuce (yum!), along with the usual rice noodles and spring roll.My only complaint is that the restaurant is pretty small, so it usually can't accommodate large parties unless you're one of the only patrons there. With limited seating, Xinh Xinh also fills up rapidly on busy nights, especially for their Wednesday night pho happy hour. I would suggest avoiding peak hours or getting your food to-go if you are impatient about waiting for a table.If you add Xinh Xinh as a friend on Facebook, you can get updates on their daily/weekly specials. This is really helpful for vegetarians as some of the veg-friendly options (e.g., pho chay) are only offered on certain days.

<Content> Being essentially a Vietnamese food virgin, I was eager to try a big bowl of this pho stuff I've heard so much about. I decided to dive in head-first and choose the weirdest option, the pho with tripe and tendon. I mean, when else do you see tripe and tendon on a menu? Might as well get it.I decided that I really like pho, but not tripe or tendon. (Seemed kind of flavorless, and the tripe's appearance especially skeeved me out.) The steak and Vietnamese meatballs were delicious, though, as were the noodles, sprouts, and everything else in that seemingly bottomless bowl! I finished maybe less than half of the whole thing, and for $5 on Wednesday nights, that is a CRAZY good deal. My boyfriend's garlic beef bahn mi was to die for: the beef was excellently flavored and the pickled daikon was crunchy and fresh-tasting. I will certainly try one of these sandwiches next time I go back.We split an avocado shake for dessert, and all I can say is WHERE HAVE THESE BEEN ALL MY LIFE? So smooth, sweet, and creamy, and still retaining the subtle flavor of avocado. Cramazing. The guy ringing us up told us that he uses a whole avocado (!), half and half, sweetened condensed milk, and ice, all blended together. He also said that a couple customers had been on him to figure out how many calories were in it, but I begged him not to. Some things I'm happier not knowing.

<Content> I don't know why people don't like the wings here. I actually think they are outstanding. Maybe there's a different set of wings from the fried sweet and spicy honey wings. I don't often eat fried food, but these wings have a delicate crunch and they are covered with this great sauce. There's honey, of course, and hot pepper flakes, and possibly ginger...my friend and I are dying to try and replicate this taste.I went today and, since I had gotten my refund check, decided to splurge. I had the lime soda, which was delicious and refreshing and homemade, not too sweet. We split the aforementioned wings, which are moist and delicious, and spring rolls, which were crunchy and fresh and held together well.My friend and I also got banh mi, which I have never had before. I got mine with garlic beef and was rewarded with soft crunchy bread, a subtle bite of pickled veggies, and tender savory bits of beef. I thought it was really tasty! There was a lot of bread, though, and I'm not sure it was much different from a normal baguette I could buy. I understand that banh mi is supposed to be on bread with rice and wheat flour, so I expected it to be a little lighter. Everything was really good though. In fact, I know that in the warmer months they offer vermicelli bowls, and I can't wait to try that. I also want to come for $5 pho on Wednesday. Yum.One weird thing: I'd love it if we got some plates with our appetizers. I always end up making a mess!

<Content> Good stuff. We went around 7pm Friday night; a 3-5 minute wait for a table. We ordered pho, a banh mi with pork roll and pate, spring rolls, a lime soda, and a vanilla boba tea.The pho was the lighter style; less salty, but also less rich. (I compare it to the Southern style you find in San Francisco.) The tripe was fresh and bouncy, the tendon a little soft, and the beef a little less flavorful than I like, but the noodles were excellent. The broth could be due to the fact we went late. (If they run out of broth during the day, they have to make more, and it can be a little thin.)The banh mi was great - the baguette was very fresh and light. Excellent balance of meat and carrot. The Mrs. thought the meat was too meaty, but this often happens - I tend to prefer my meat a little... gamier. I'm not the biggest fan of daikon, but this worked out. I would ask to hold the cilantro next time, but that's me, not them.The spring rolls - excellent. They include a small strip of what seems like either deep fried tofu skin or rice paper, and a strip of some kind of pork (it reminded me of the kind of maling meat-food-product that you get in spam musubi, but fried). Truly excellent balance of flavors.On a sad note, we never got our drinks (and on top of that, when we went to pay, they explained were out of boba (!), but the service was otherwise full of smiles, polite, reasonably fast (although not fast enough for a working lunch), while leaving us in peace to eat.The owner was ringing us up immediately recognized that we didn't get our drinks and apologized, explaining that they're still working out the kinks. I have no problem with that. They seem understaffed; it's always difficult running a new restaurant and the little extra effort makes me forgive forgetting the drinks.Verdict: Would pay about 2x as much.

<Content> I visited Xinh Xinh when it first opened. I had been going crazy over the fact that there were no restaurants in the area that served good tasting, authentic Vietnamese food. Then I found Xinh Xinh Cafe.Their banh mi is still the best tasting I have had to date. Fresh ingredients, great flavor, what more can you ask for? They also have a great variety of specialty drinks that I really enjoyed, including the avocado shake. Definitely expand your horizons. So worth it!The pho is dece - nothing extraordinary. The serving sizes aren't too large, but it does the job when you're hungry and just feenin for some hot noodle soup to warm your bones.Owner is nice and personable. He loves to talk to his customers and get to know them.Love this place!

<Content> Judging by how packed the place was on Wed, word is getting out!A solid four stars after trying the 5 buck pho special on Wed nights. Trying to be a more adventure-some eater, I chose the pho with all the meats, including tendon and tripe.Everything was wonderful. Pho is served with tons of mix-ins to flavor it just to your taste. Mung sprouts, jalapeno, cilantro, Thai basil, fish sauce, schriraca, soy sauce, hot cock (the super hot chili garlic sauce with rooster on bottle, geesh ya perv!) etc.I actually really enjoyed everything but the tendon. Even though it melted in mouth like butter, just couldn't get over eating TENDON. Tripe (stomach) was super chewy in a reminiscent of calamari way.Two other housemates with quite diverse taste were extremely pleased with their soups. Others have said in reviews here that they were not full, perhaps portions have increased since then.Our bowls were huge, all 3 of us could only eat about half before full on stuffed. Very worthwhile way to spend five bucks on dinner.We had fried spring rolls as an app, and all thought they were awesome. Comes with cilantro, cuke, and lettuce to wrap with the fried roll and dip into yummy sweet n' sour type sauce.Looking at the place, you wouldn't probably want to bring a group of more than 6. The tiny dining room is set up for 2-4 at a table.

<Content> Okay, so the sad strip-mall location leaves much to be desired, but this is a great little place.There were seven of us, and the owner (well, I'm maybe 90% sure he was the owner) nicely rearranged things in his tiny restaurant to make room for us, then offered tons of recommendations when he realized we were from out of town. My lemongrass chicken was good (though I've had better). The pho was awesome, and the vegetarians in our group really liked the tofu rice platter and tofu sandwich. There are a bunch of different condiments on the table for customizing your food, too.They were completely sweet and patient about doing seven separate checks and letting us wait around for our cab, taking up space in their restaurant for a very, very long time.

<Content> Xinh Xinh is in my opinion one of the best restaurants in Champaign County. While I have tried many things on their menu, their stand-out dish is their Pho. The broth is super tasty, and they use excellent quality meat which sets them apart from the other places in town that serve Pho. When you are finished eating you are full and satisfied. They also have some great appetizers, especially their Nataing.I'm not entirely sure why some people here don't like their prices. They have $5 Pho dinner specials on certain days which is a phenomenal deal (I'm not sure you could buy their quality ingredients at that price at most grocery stores), and their normal prices are less than $10 for a huge portion. A dish is a meal, and you're not going to find much in town that's cheaper. Once you factor in the food quality, eating here is a great deal.

<Content> My wife and I were among the first guests at this amazing store-front restaurant. If I recall correctly, we were there on the first night they were open. Since, we've been back a few times, always loving it. Unfortunately, most (all?) of our favorites depend in great measure on carbs, and my wife prefers to avoid the temptation. (When she reads this, I will be in such trouble!)Tonight, being the last night before my wife comes back from visiting family, etc., I went over and had a few of *my* favorites, kinda pigging out a bit.I had the Fried Spring Rolls appetizer, some of the best Vietnamese fried spring rolls I've ever had. They are served with lettuce leaves, cucumber strips, and cilantro sprigs. The intention is that you wrap a Spring Roll, some cilantro, and a cucumber strip in a leaf of lettuce, then dip that package into the lime fish sauce and enjoy. You get a lovely combination of fried, crispy, oily, hot, cool, and fresh.I also had the Nataing appetizer. This is a small bowl (I want a big bowl!) of meaty, spicy, oily, sweet yumminess, served with prawn chips for dipping, and a few pieces of good French bread. (When they first opened, they used a different prawn chip. I enjoyed them because they were different than I'd had anywhere else. The current chips probably are a bit better, though.) The French bread works really well for soaking up the sauce and becoming bites of pleasure.I finished with a Charbroiled Beef Skewer sandwich. Very flavorful beef with a spicy papaya and carrot salad and cilantro sprigs. I wound up removing the top of the (good French bread) loaf (which I took home to have for breakfast tomorrow) because I was running low on capacity. I had a couple cilantro sprigs left from the Spring rolls, which I added to the sandwich. This made a great sandwich. I think with the top bread in place, the bread to filling ratio is higher than I prefer (partly because the meat is so very good).As I was paying, I noticed a white board with a variety of vermicelli noodle bowl dishes. At other Vietnamese restaurants, these are among my favorites, and I will have to come back here soon to try their version.Almost forgot to talk about service. Very friendly and attentive, but between the kitchen and servers, they do not understand the concept of pacing. I got both appetizers and sandwich quickly, but within a span of about 3 minutes. I suggest that if you care about such things, you order the appetizer(s). Then, when you are nearly finished with them, order the main course(s).

<Content> It pains me to say it, but there's a reason I don't go here anymore. Went there for the first time in months recently and was seriously disappointed. My husband's fried fish banh mi had one seriously tiny piece of fish on it, and my nem nuong banh mi was similarly lacking in meat. Their banh mi have never been especially generous in the meat department, but this time it was pretty sad. It was mostly made of pickled veggies. In comparison, Black Dog's sandwiches are about $8 ($3 more than most of the banh mi) and they're huge and come with a side. I'd rather pay a bit more and get a better sandwich.Two stars because the banh mi my sister got (creamy pork) was better and the service is always good.

<Content> So I took the family last night and branched out from my beloved Banh Mi. We had pho, a vermicelli bowl (chicken), and the beef spare rib rice platter. Pho was amazing, and the noodle bowl looked beautiful, though I didn't get to try it. The toddler launched handfuls of the beef spare rib and accompanying veggie egg roll into her mouth fistfuls at a time. Preschooler seemed especially fond of the pickled veggies that came with the rice platter.Since this was also my first time dining in, I can confirm that Shai is as great as he seems in the other reviews. The place was really busy, but he happily took the time to explain what the specials were, and gave instructions about how to prepare the pho with the herbs, veggies, and sauces.So now I am going to have a true dilemma each and every time I go to Xinh Xinh. If everything is great, which one will I choose?

<Content> I'm guessing Champaign-Urbana doesn't have a very large Vietnamese population, since this is somehow considered a 4-star Vietnamese restaurant.First, it took forever for our orders to be taken, and a table that got seated 10 minutes after us had their orders taken & brought out first.Secondly, I thought the banh mi (dac biet), quite frankly, sucked. The pickled vegetables overpowered the flavor of the meats, they were too tart, and there was too much of them. Something tells me most of the people raving about them haven't had legitimate banh mi.On the plus side, the guy who was working the counter was very smiley & friendly to a table with a mom & two young kids. I thought that was very sweet.

<Content> What happened, Xinh Xinh? We used to take out of town people here because we were so impressed with the place.Last time we got take-out. Three banh mis and an order of wings. Wings were pretty good and certainly well seasoned with fish sauce. (If you are not used to the smell of fish sauce, this might not be too appealing.) My wife's sister's banh mi seemed pretty good, but ours had very little meat on them. They still had the jalapeno peppers and cilantro, but the mayonnaise seemed less, too. I got the catfish banh mi and the fish was tiny - especially in comparison to previous trips. We'd noticed a decline in the quality of the bubble teas, too. Originally they were really strong and offered flavors that Cafe Evo didn't.  But last time we got one (it was a while ago), it seemed like it was made with non-dairy creamer instead of milk.Disappointed. Probably not going back - I guess I have an excuse to try making my own banh mi or pho instead.The service was still good, but the food is simply not as good as it was when they opened.

<Content> The Pho is tasty (particularly the brisket), but the highlight is definitely the banh mi sandwiches. I typically come here with my husband, so we'll split a pho and sandwich, and it's hard to beat.The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because we have a lot of vegetarian friends who we like to dine out with, but I'm told Xinh Xinh only serves vegetarian broth for pho on certain days. Would love it if they could figure out a way to have it on the menu full time.But the moral is, give it a try! Definitely the best pho in town.

<Content> Tried Pho for the first time here. Excellent stuff. It forced me to expand my taste palate a bit, as I don't usually have cinammon, star anise, etc., with beef, but it was very enjoyable. Would love to have more jalepeno in the dish, but again, I think that's my palate trying to drag the flavor into something else. Huge bowl of beef broth with meats and huge plate of mung bean sprouts, jalepenos, lime wedges, cilantro- excellent additions to the soup. Of course I also grabbed my first Boba tea there, excellent. The owner was super kind, had great suggestions, and is continually playing to hone his menu. We'll have to go back to explore more yumminess.On The Wings:In talking to the owner, he ran down a good portion of his menu for us, and explained what he feels is good and others buy frequently. In this discussion he mentioned the wings! Guys- the reason it smells funny, as with all Vietnamese cuisine, is that fish-sauce is used instead of salt. So... those chicken wings? A special fish-sauce dressing! If you weren't expecting the smell of fish, there's your issue right there. That has got to be the issue with the other comments about the wings.We'll be back, and thanks to all the Yelper's comments on this place! Excellent owner, clean, and enjoyable food!

<Content> Not a huge fan. I went mostly for the boba tea (eager to try something beyond Evo) but had to eat as well. I knew there wouldn't be much for me as a non-beef eater (pho is out) but the shrimp spring rolls were pretty good. Not so satisfied with the green tea boba I ordered. It wasn't slushy (which is okay) but the flavor was not as bitter as I was expecting from green tea and I just didn't like it. So I tried again and got an almond tea, which was more to my liking. Flavors seemed a bit hit and miss (my friend's spiced chai was pretty good, but red bean, not so much) so I wouldn't really be willing to go and explore more flavors in case I get more misses. On the plus side, the boba itself (the tapioca balls) were smaller, chewier, and overall much more pleasant to eat than the boba at evo. The staff was also very nice and friendly -- so points to that.

<Content> Nice people, but when you leave you'll want to get a sandwich somewhere for some protein (or some root vegetables). The Pho noodle soup is attractively presented, with a cup of rice noodles at the bottom of a 5 cup bowl of hot broth. Then there are two wafer-thin slices of beef swimming in the hot broth, and a side plate of bean sprouts to add to the pho soup. Not very fulfilling but it tastes authentic.

<Content> I love Vietnamese food. I could eat it all day every day for god knows how long. When I moved to Champaign a couple of years ago, I was extremely disappointed that there were no good Vietnamese places in Champaign-Urbana. There's Saigon down in Savoy, but if you take the bus or bike everywhere (like I do) it's a little too far away.Which brings us to Xinh Xinh. The menu is small, composed primarily of appetizers, banh mi (vietnamese sandwiches), and pho (beef broth soup); however, here it's all about the quality, not the quantity. I've been to plenty of restaurants with bloated menus that only have one or two things I want to try. I think I've tried most of the menu at Xinh Xinh, and I've enjoyed all of it.Also, the owner is very interested in his customers' opinions and will probably come ask you how things are going at some point during your meal. He's extremely accommodating to various diets (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free), so if you have a specific need, just ask him, and he'll do his best to work it out for you.To break it down: the place has a nice, modern atmosphere; the owner is a great guy and comes out to get feedback from customers all the time; and the food is a delicious combination of traditional vietnamese flavors with some slight variations (i.e. the fried egg roll wrapper in the fresh spring rolls). Just give it a try sometime, and I promise you'll want to go back for more.One quick note: Xinh Xinh is cash only, so save yourself some trouble and make sure you have cash on hand when you go. Trust me - it seems like a very small inconvenience once you try the food.

It was a little pricey for the quality and i expected more based on phenomenal reviews. I went with two other friends and one ordered the vegetarian Pho which was actually very good. I more than likely will not return to this restaurant but if I do I'll know to load up on the sriacaha and soy sauce.

<Content> I'm a vegetarian--let's just start there. The only reason I ended up at Xinh Xinh was because I'd been told that it existed and because I work across the street. I have enjoyed both the summer rolls and the spring rolls so far, and I must say they are delicious! The summer rolls are particularly so; they have tofu and fresh veggies wrapped in rice paper. The peanut sauce could be a bit less salty, but I can survive. I've also had the fried spring rolls, but those weren't as good; they seemed not to have much in the way of veggies and the vegan sauce didn't have much flair. They were deep fried a bit too much and I ended up with a stomachache. The bubble tea is as good as any; plenty of bubbles but could be a bit stronger. I had the papaya.All in all, certainly a place to try, but don't expect a full meal if you are a vegetarian! Nowhere near as good as the Vietnamese food my friends have made me, but for Champaign-Urbana, it's probably among the best.Another note: they aren't open very late, so keep this in mind!Update: The tofu stir fry sandwich single handedly made me change this. That, and the vegetarian pho that Shai has once a month! Yummy!This has become one of my #1 places for food on-the-go.

<Content> Nice atmosphere, but the food is just ok. Not exactly authentic Vietnamese. We tried the pho and Thai fish cake sandwich. We also had beef skewers - a Cambodian dish. We didn't like the beef skewers at all, the marinade had a sour note. The pho was salty but not really aromatic. My sandwich had good bread and meat, but the condiments weren't right, especially the pickled vegetables. They were too sweet and not traditional. They also topped it off with a sweet and sour sauce, which was a bit odd. For dessert, we shared the fried bananas. I believe they used unripened bananas, so they were firm but not sweet at all.

ALSO, when I ordered the grilled pork rice plate and requested not to have an eggroll, but a fried egg (which is more traditional Vietnamese)...the server said he (perhaps he was the owner) does not want to start providing that!?!??!Like I said, I have had better, more AUTHENTIC Vietnamese food elsewhere...but if you never had, this place should suffice!

Of course, the soups are still made with beef broth, but the tofu is thick and killer.

Since it's winter they have a new dish called congee, which is a rice porridge that is made out of a veggie/chicken broth...delish...brings me back to my childhood. They also have a few new sandwiches.Don't forget to try out the new curry beef sandwich (which are still a great deal for the price) and the other sandwich with some kind of spicy coconut sauce in it...

<Content> This is actually the second time I've been here. It wasn't terrible, but it was rather underwhelming. My girlfriend and I got banh mi sandwiches, since I had recently read about them online. On mine, though, the BBQ pork wasn't very flavorful, and the bun was a bit stale. This was on a $5 sandwich. My girlfriend's was a bit better, because it had grease to soften the bun, but once again relatively underwhelming. Also, I felt like we were a bit glossed over in favor of regulars. A couple sat next to us, after we sat down, ordered after us, but received their food and drinks before us. I'm a bit disappointed after seeing all the reviews and large crowd, but the people there were almost entirely aging hipsters, so I'm willing to accept that their judgment is a bit weak.It wasn't terrible, but I don't think I'll be going again.

<Content> Let me start off with the good. I thought the cleanliness and decor of the restaurant was good. The tables were not sticky, the chairs were clean, and the floors were clean. I didn't mind that it was a small restaurant. I'm used to that from dining in San Diego. Our server was very nice, patient with us, and made sure our water glasses were filled. Now for the bad part. I did not like the food. Three of us ordered the bun (bun nem noung, bun thit cha gio, bun cha gio) and our fourth ordered the banh mi dac biet. The meat in the bun was extremely dried out, hard, overcooked, and tasteless. I thought that nem noung was suppose to be meatballs on skewers that were grilled or patties that were grilled. Instead we were served chopped up pieces of dried out pork. The grilled chicken bun was the same way. The food portions were fine. I would've preferred much more lettuce, bean sprouts, and herbs. I also would've liked peanuts and fried shallots on top of the bun. I also didn't like the the sauce that came with it. It was lacking in flavor. It was neither salty, sweet, nor spicy. The banh mi was average. The pickled daikon and carrots and the cha lua were the best things about it. The pate was horrible. The bread was not the typical banh mi baguette. I've never seen a banh mi baguette that had corn meal on the bottom of it, thus I assumed it was regular American-made bread. It was too dense and hard. The egg rolls in the bun tasted okay. Our food was presented nicely. But the food tasted only so-so to almost bad. I almost wished one of us had tried the pho just so I could get a better idea of the food.I understand my review is somewhat harsh. Two of us are from San Diego, one is from Dallas, and the fourth is my mom. We are used to good Vietnamese food. Xinh Xinh did not deliver.

<Content> I'm no pho expert. I've only had it a couple times in my life, but Xinh Xinh makes some pretty good pho in my opinion. I had the combination pho which came with a variety of meats including some raw ribeye which cooked beautifully in the delicious hot broth. The pho came with the standard pho accoutrements: basil, lime, and sprouts. I also had the lime soda which was nice and refreshing, but I'd probably skip it the next time I visit. Seems a bit overpriced for lime, sugar and club soda in a cup. I've also had their banh mi. The bread they use is great, crusty on the outside, soft and tender on the inside. Their combination bahn mi is a little funky which I attribute to the headcheese and pate, but it's mighty tasty. The pickled vegetables are great although I feel my sandwich had a bit too much and some bites were just bread and veggies while some were just meat and bread. However, when you do find a balance between all of the components it makes for one delicious bite.Xinh Xinh will be my go to for Vietnamese food, although I don't believe there are many options for Vietnamese food in C-U anyways.

<Content> Xinh Xinh Cafe used to be a regular stop for me and my roommate on the weekends after running errands in the morning. We have had lunch here several times in the past year, usually to satisfy my craving for pho, which I have enjoyed immensely in Vietnamese restaurants in Chicago and Dallas-Ft.Worth. The last time I came here, I had fried spring rolls and pho with thin sliced beef. The noodles were great, meat was just right, and the bean sprouts and herbs were fresh (but could be fresher). I also had Vietnamese iced coffee (ca phe sua da, condensed milk with black coffee that slowly drips down into the cup as it sits on your table) that was as authentic as any Vietnamese coffee I have ever tasted. Service here has been great, as well. My main gripe with Xinh Xinh cafe is that their portions are incredibly tiny. When I spend $15 for a meal, including tip, I expect to leave satisfied, but the serving size just doesn't cut it for me. I can understand this price point because it's probably the only decent Vietnamese restaurant in Central Illinois, but still, I think they can do a lot better for the price.

<Content> I'm so happy that Xinh Xinh finally opened! I've gone twice now and both times I loved everything I tried. The pho is the best in C-U in my opinion 'cuz it tastes the way authentic pho should. The broth is very flavorful and tastes like time and care was put into it's preparation. The veggies that come with the pho looked nice and fresh. The plum soda tastes just like it does back home...salty and sweet just the way I like it. It's definitely an acquired taste though. The almond boba I tried was also delish and refreshing. The rice paper wrapped spring rolls (the fried version) were very tasty and I loved being able to wrap them in the lettuce and mint leaves. The rolls looked skinny but they were actually quite filling...you get 4. I also tried the fresh spring rolls (not fried) and those were huge! The fried wontons inside were a delightful surprise and the whole thing tasted so good! The meat is definitely flavored well. You get 2 in an order but one was already filling for me. I would definitely still try to eat both by myself though! And the sandwiches...also the best in C-U (although I think Xinh Xinh is the only place that actually has banh mi sandwiches). There's a variety to choose from but I tried the grilled pork sandwich. The size was just right. It had plenty of the delicious traditional fillings like pickled radish and carrots, jalapenos, cilantro, etc. The pork was super tasty and there was plenty of it. The prices were reasonable for this area -- about $2 for the drinks, $4 for appetizers and sandwiches, and $7 for the pho (all prices approximate). I also just noticed that Xinh Xinh has weekly specials for things not on the menu, like rice dishes. I'll have to try that next time. There's actually a lot of other things I want to try. Service is still pretty fast even though I only saw one waiter. For takeout, I would call ahead. Overall, I love this place and I will definitely be coming back as much as I can as long as the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff never changes. [Ok, this review got pretty long...but this place is great. Go try it now!!]

Had banh mi which was just ok and chicken curry which was better than most average places but lacking in flavor compared to the top tier in C-U. Another plus they have taro milk tea.

I ordered a rice plate and the girlfriend ordered a beef pho. I would recommend ordering from cravings or another vietnamesr place if your in the mood for good vietnamese food. Also the cost was about 20 bucks.

<Content> Pretty good little joint. It's definitely a change from the majority of other restaurants in the C-U area.As for the food, the banh mi is good. Fresh vegetables, tasty ingredients, a little small, but that's to be expected. The vermicelli is good too. Decent portions, delectable stuff!It seems like the rice dishes can be underwhelming (friends orders). Stick to your pho, banh mi, vermicelli.

Nice, casual atmosphere with very friendly staff. My particular favorite dish is the ground beef curry banh mi with cilantro and green mango. It's especially delicious if you like some heat and get fresh jalapenos on it. Scrumptious! Also, I quite enjoy the tofu summer rolls.

They have everything a solid pho joint needs - great chili sauces, fine grained pepper, lime wedges, jalapenos, sprouts, basil, etc;. Easily the best on campus. The staff is friendly, efficient, and attentive. Plus, they're signed up with Perk Pug so its easy to get deals if you're a frequent customer. Its clean, well-decorated, and rarely too crowded. I cannot recommend this place enough!

<Content> Today's lunch marked my third meal at Xinh Xinh since it opened last year. My husband wanted to try the bahn mi special with a beef teriyaki patty so I figured I would too. I think when it comes down to it, I just want the bahn mi without any protein filling. The dikon and sauce are so delicious with the french bread that adding a filling almost ruins it. That being said, perhaps I would feel differently if I chose something less heavy as the protein, like tofu or a thin piece of chicken. This was too meaty, but man oh man the bread, dikon, and sauce have been a hit three out of three times.

<Content> holy shit WORST BUBBLE TEA I'VE EVER HAD. i know a fair bit about bubble tea, and this must have been a sick joke. i thought Evo Cafe on campus had bad tasting bubble tea, but that was only slightly bad compared to what Xinh Xinh Cafe gave me. it was truly AWFUL. i have been to quite a few bubble tea establishments in my life, and never tasted tapioca this bad. it's normally chewy, and some places make it firmer than others, which is fine, I personally like softer, but whatever they put in my drink was like... chalky. way to solid. it shouldn't even, be edible whatever it is. maybe it had expired?? is that possible?this is the first & last time i go here for bubble tea. maybe their food is better, i didn't try it. also i got the green tea flavor, and they didn't ask me if i wanted milk in it. i feel like most places will ask you if you want green milk tea or not, or at least all the places ive been to in New York City would ask. so i basically was given sugar water with a bit of green tea flavor.aside from the awful drink, the employee was friendly enough, and i feel like for the size of the drink you're getting your money's worth, so that's good at least. but if you want good bubble tea, PLEASE go to Cocomero (on Wright st!) ...it's amazing.OH also, when we got home, we poured soy milk into it, which did make it taste a lot better.

<Content> When I normally go too a Vietnamese place back at home in California, I normally go to get some pho. So I thought i'd try out Xinh Xinh Cafe's pho, since it's been weeks since I've gotten my Pho fix! I'm sorry to say, that I wasn't at all impressed with the pho they had at this restaurant. It tasted bland. You know pho is awesome when you don't have to add any siracha or hoisin sauce to it. I definitely loaded my pho with siracha and hoisin. But even then, it wasn't so appetizing.Other than this, I thought ALL of the spring rolls here were awesome! You must try the fried spring rools wrapped up in lettuce appetizers. Also, one of my friends had an awesome rice place...not sure which one it was, but it was pretty yummy! I recommend ordering a rice plate or vermicelli plate, instead of getting any of the pho.Lastly, I was surprised with there fried banana dessert! I normally have vanilla or coconut ice cream with fried banana, but instead, they drizzled this AMAZING chocolate sauce over it....AMAZING! YOU MUST TRY IT! :)

<Content> Urbana, IL has an embarrassment of good restaurants to choose from, and Xinh Xinh is high on the list. Both the hubster and I are quite fond of Vietnamese food and seek it our wherever we are, so we ate here twice during our 3 day stay. First, I really like the space, which, with its' corrugated metal walls and local art work, manages to be both urban and cozy at the same time. The guy at the counter waits tables, so he sat us, brought us water and served our food, all while taking care of other customers and running the counter very efficiently and with a smile. I had eaten a large lunch, so had the tofu summer rolls, which were great...very fresh veggies and marinated tofu, with a crunchy fried component in the center that added textural interest, served with a tasty hoisin-peanut sauce. When I looked around I noticed many other folks had ordered those tofu summer rolls, so they're very popular. I also ordered the chicken dumplings, which were excellent...tasty little fried morsels served with a sweet fish sauce dipping sauce. Doug had the bun (vermicelli rice noodle bowl) with chicken and an extra fried spring roll and said it was great...noodles a little thicker than the average that looked homemade and well marinated chicken, served with a sauce that he thought too sweet initially, but then warmed up to. Xinh Xinh has a wide range of beverages choices, from bubble teas to Vietnamese sodas, hot tea, an avocado shake, Thai iced tea, coconut juice, and that most delicious of beverages, Vietnamese drip coffee sweetened with condensed milk...rich and sweet yumminess. We had the banh mi on our second visit, which is the traditional Vietnamese baguette sandwich. We tried the roast pork pate combo and the pepper chicken, and they were both good, but not stellar. I admit to being a little spoiled by the banh mi at Dong Phuong in New Orleans, which have ruined the experience for me anywhere else. We didn't try the pho, as we don't eat beef and they don't offer the chicken variety, although they do have a vegetarian pho on the menu. I like the thought they put into everything here, from the fresh ingredients to the cute decor. They even have their own little hand drawn character...the Pho King Man...keep in mind that "pho" is pronounced "fu" and then say it out loud. You'll get it.

Could not figure out what one of the herbs that we got on the 'toss this stuff in your pho' plate was, turns out they special order 'culantro', which is a more vietnamese type of cilantro... pretty cool. Really nice staff/owner, I'll be dropping by again next time I need a big bowl of hot soup.

Grilled pork is always a safe choice for banh mi and vermicelli bowls. 4 stars because their pho (the quintessential Vietnamese dish!) is only so-so.

It was full of flavor and very filling. I ended up coming in the next day for the pho and again was impressed with the dish. The owner, Shai, remembered me from the previous day too.

In the meantime some free-range children (you know the kind that are fed and clothed but not raised?) were raising hell at the next table while their oblivious mother enjoyed her soup. My husband while paying our bill, innocently opened the front door and let the children escape. They instantly when running down the sidewalk... the mother chased them down and brought them back into the restaurant.

<Content> Let me start out by saying, I started my Pho life at one of the best Pho restaurants in the nation, which makes me have really high standards. After moving to CU I need a pho fix and I thought Xinh xihn would do the trick but it left much to be desired. The Pho broth itself was weak and sweet. The condiments that are served with Pho (sawtooth herb, bean sprouts, lime, basil) were skimpy at best. The meat was tough and bland. The fish sauce they served was some of the worst fish sauce I've ever had and they had no clue what Chinese black vinegar was. The service was average as was the atmosphere. I will be looking else where for my pho fix.Didn't try the sandwiches, but not sure if I'm willing to go back and try them.

<Content> First, I have to say that before I came to this restaurant, I had already heard that it was a great place for authentic Vietnamese food. So, I am sure that this mindset affected this review. But regardless, carry on and read!I came here with one other friend on a weekday evening. The place was pretty hard to find even though we got directions and it turned out to be a small area right next to a big Schnuck's. The area made it seem like a small step above one of those 'hole-in-the-wall' restaurants, but when going inside it is actually very clean and cozy. My friend and I both had the pho that had bascially of the meats in it (which, you'll know when you read the descriptions on the menu, but I forget the name). It was really nice on a cold night and really filling for a good price! Overall, the experience was great. The food, atmosphere, and waiters were great. The only thing that would deter me from going again would be the location - it's too far away from campustown!!

We had to wait quite awhile for someone to take our order, and no one ever came to ask how everything was or to refill our drinks. I wish I had ordered an appetizer or side dish because, while what I had was delicious, it was not quite filling. I will be back again when I am in the mood for good Vietnamese food.

<Content> After reading so many rave reviews this place, I was a bit skeptical on my first visit a couple of weeks ago. I was also slightly intimidated, as I'd never had Vietnamese-American food before -- a glaring omission in my culinary education -- but the concepts of meat and veggies on a baguette and noodle soup are so deeply ingrained into my consciousness that I was excited to try a different cultural twist on the familiar. I was absolutely not disappointed; I tried the banh mi (#2) and my dining companion had pho, and we were both incredibly happy eaters. The owner was personable and very excited about his food -- his passion for what he does is obvious both in conversation and simply in dining. The only negative part of the meal was our server, a surly woman who toed the line of outright rudeness throughout our visit. Nonetheless, I intend to go back tonight, and often in the future. Crappy service doesn't even begin to phase me with food this good.

<Content> I've eaten here a handful of times, but must say I have mixed feelings. The owner and employees are very friendly. But I was a bit dissapointed with the beef skewers and the sandwiches with the lemongrass beef. The problem was the beef itself. The chunks were very fatty and full of gristle. In some cases, I couldn't even eat certain sections, as they were just too fatty and gristly. I mentioned this to the owner and he said that they use "marbled" beef. In other words, fatty beef. Other than that, the things I had there were pretty decent. But it could definitely be better.

<Content> Xinh Xinh is where I go whenever I'm missing the amenities and diverse cuisine of home (L.A). Shai, who also hails from L.A., does a great job in bringing some good, cheap Vietnamese food to a town that has a limited selection of tasty and fairly authentic ethnic foods beyond the few Chinese gems I've found. Though its definitely not quite like going to Little Saigon in Santa Ana, Xinh Xinh offers some really tasty food. Their pho is really good, though definitely smaller than the ones I've had at home, and their Vermicelli bowls are also super tasty. I'm especially fond of the egg rolls that go into the Vermicelli bowls, which are really different from the ones I've had at home. I've also had some of their rice dishes which are excellent.One of my favorite things though on their menu is their Nataing, or ground pork(?) in coconut milk. It is really different and sooo yummy with the chips that they use which crackle when you put the Nataing over them.The service is always great, and Shai the owner is super-friendly and accommodating. I always go early on Wednesdays because it's a hole in the wall place and gets busy for Happy Hour Pho, but even without the Wednesday discount the food is always still well worth its price.

<Content> My boyfriend and I were looking forward to this restaurant since it received four out of five stars on yelp. We ordered vegetable egg rolls and two bowls of pho. 1) The vegetable egg rolls were overly oily and the owner gave us sweet and sour sauce instead of the usual fish sauce that we normally get at other Vietnamese restaurants. But that wasn't the real issue...the biggest issue came from...2) Pho: Out of all the authentic Vietnamese restaurants we have been to (several at Argyle in Chicago and other places outside of Chicago-NY, VA), this place was by far the worst. First, the soup was too bland that we had to put in a lot of sriracha and hoison sauce -- normally, at other places we've been to, the soup would not need any seasoning because of the already flavorful beef broth (in other words, it was optional to put in the sauce but in this case, even with the additional sauce, the soup was still bad). Noodles were not fully cooked and after a few bites, we gave up. 3) Price: For some odd reason, they charge fairly high for their dishes. You can have far better tasting pho at other places in Chicago for much cheaper price!All in all, we were very disappointed. Ever since the viet place on Savoy closed, we have been wanting to try other Viet places in Champaign/Urbana. The positive reviews here may have been for other dishes but it is still hard for me to believe that this place received four stars out of five. Usually I can depend on Yelp reviews and they have been fairly consistent with my personal experiences but this definitely was an exception.

<Content> Very, very good food for extremely low prices. The sticky rice pudding is exceptionally good for $1. I like the sandwiches a lot.

<Content> The Best Vietnamese Pho in town. Came here often because it was fast service. The bean sprouts and cilantro leaves was always fresh. Broth was clean and flavorful. Definitely a place to check out if you are into pho. The owner is from Cali so I knew at that point that he knows how good pho tastes.

<Content> This is one of my favorite Thai place on campus (after Golden wok) They have a special pho on wednesday for $5 but I haven't gone yet so i'm not quite sure how it is. But their regular pho is pretty good and the portion is pretty big. I really like their summer rolls (the meat is very good). Not a big fan of their bahmi sandwiches but I think i've been spoiled by the north side chicago bahmi sandwiches. Another dish that I really like is their tofu dish, it comes with a lot of things and soup and it's very cheap and affordable so definitely worth a try. I will definitely try going on wednesdays for the pho. Oh the actual restaurant is very small and since I came in with just one other people, they always make us sit in these tiny tables along the wall that barely fits all our dishes. Also, you have to bring the check up to pay so don't just wait there waiting for someone to take ur credit card

<Content> 5 star for Chambana, maybe 4 star in general.You would be hard-pressed to find better banh mi in Chambana, though that wouldn't be the case up in Chicago.The pho is good, but a bit pricey for the portions. I would recommend NOT getting the bubble tea, unless of course you're cool with powdery bubble tea rather than fresh.The reason this earns such a high rating from me is the banh mi sandwiches. Relatively cheap and filling and delicious! Not the absolute best, but still pretty damn good.

<Content> I love Xinh Xinh Cafe! The tofu banh mi is tasty with a bit of spice and the pho is great! Every weekend they have been serving vegetarian pho and let me tell you I like this even more than the beef pho! The owner is a great guy and a number of times he's come out to our table and asked us how the food was and talked to us. Definitely someone who wants his customers satisfied! Everyone I've taken to Xinh Xinh has really liked it! I recommend checking it out for sure!!!

<Content> Really good pho. Rich and flavorful! If you are on a high fat diet like I am then ask them for a cup of beef fat (they skim it from the beef broth) to add to your soup! Awesome way to keep warm on a winter day.

<Content> Don't really know much about Vietnamese food, but vegetarian Pho was delicious, with tofu,mushrooms, bamboo shoots, etc. So were summer rolls, which were tangier than I've had before, perhaps due to slightly pickled carrots inside. Service at 6 on a Friday evening was prompt and courteous, and everything, from table to floor to restrooms was clan and in good condition.

<Content> I would give their special banh mi (with extra jalapenos) 5 stars. I also like their vermicelli dishes. But their pho? Phoggedaboutit. It's basically warm water that you season with hoisin sauce, sriracha sauce, and your own tears as you pine for the soul-warming bowl of pho that's not in front of you.

<Content> excellent pho and dumplings-we come at least 1-2 times a week for the pho. the bubble tea was fine but you have to tell them that you want milk in it or that you want it blended with ice. other than that its a cute place with super quick service and very friendly people.

<Content> I've generally had a great experience here, good pho, spring rolls, and vermicelli. The specialty drinks are hit and miss depending on the day. The chicken wings are something to pass up though. I was served undercooked wings, one of which was the joint between the throwaway wing tip and flat part of the wing. The individual working there at the time was quite rude when I complained, raising her voice and complaining about how much makes and the economy. This experience ruined my overall impression since I used to really talk up the place in a positive light.

<Content> I was happy to find a place that made banh mi in this town. I've tried about half of all the different types, and my favorite is still the black pepper chicken. The vegetables are fresh and crisp, the jalapeno is spicy, and it is a really refreshing sandwich. The pho is also good, the vermicelli is better (personal preference). I'm excited about the 5 dollar vermicelli Monday lunch specials!

<Content> I used to love the stir-fried tofu sandwich, but my recent trips have disappointed me as they've made it bland and taken away the lovely sweet heat that made me crave it in the first place. The spring rolls are okay, but I've been disappointed by everything else I've tried there (pho, chicken, all other sandwiches including pork and beef). For central Illinois, it's okay, but I'll just wait to head back towards Chicago for better Vietnamese food. I want to like the place - the owner is sweet, the decoration is nice, but the food just leaves a lot to be desired.

<Content> reading some of the reviews I am not sure what people are looking for. I had appetizer number two and a bowl of pho. the appetizer was spectacular and the pho was delicious. served very quickly and the service was solid. just really good. The spicy condiment in the little jar on the table was outstanding if you like heat and was much fresher than most of the pho joints I go to.

<Content> Not the best Vietnamese food you'll ever had. It's definitely pretty good though for a decent price. I stick to the veg menu so I can't say much about the rest of the food. The sandwiches and noodles are good. Sometimes I can tell that they don't use the freshest ingredients though.

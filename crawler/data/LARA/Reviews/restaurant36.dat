<Content> I am new to the area and am starting to test out restaurants. This one did not disappoint. I deducted one star because the delivery time was going to take an eternity, so I had to go pick it up. I know that doesn't sound like a huge hardship, but I was already in my PJs and parking is a little tricky there. That said, the food was great. I ordered the following:Samosas: they were crispy and soft in the perfect way. The potato filling was super tasty and they are not shy with spices. The green dipping sauce (sorry, no idea what it's called) was spicy and delicious. I could eat these all day. Probably shouldn't.Veggie curry: Fantastic! Great mix of veggies, not too much cream. Even better reheated the next day. Finishing it as I type.I look forward to eating there, it looks like a cute, laid-back space.

<Content> This was my first experience with Indian food and I wasn't too impressed. Sitara has the best reviews on Yelp and I even ordered a lot of food to try and get a variety of different things.I had the mixed grill which is Malai, Tikka, Garlic and Tandoori Chicken, and also comes with a lamb seekh kabob. I also got the Paneer Pakoras and the yellow Dol and rice which came with the meal.Almost all of the chicken were in boneless chunks, with the exception of 2 wings, which I believe were the Tandoori. They were all pretty dry and almost similar to each other. Maybe this is because they are grilled rather than fried? Maybe I'm just used to heavily breaded chicken? I'm not sure. I did like the flavor of the Tikka(?) though, it was a little sweet and spicy. The lamb kabab was a little more flavorful and better in consistency but still wasn't as good as I'd hoped. Now, the rice that came with my entre was surprisingly good for being just basmati rice. I was also given what felt like at least a pound of it, so no shortage there. The yellow Dol is not something I ever had before, but that I did like. It had a really interesting herbal flavor to it and can most closely be described as a soup.I also got an appetizer of Paneer Pakoras which I'd say are similar to a mozzarella stick but not as greasy and heavy. These were good but by the time I had gotten around to eating them were inevitably cold. They were unusually tasty and came with 2 dipping sauces. One was a VERY spicy green sauce and I'm not sure about the other one, possibly a sweet berry sauce. Either way these sauces were delicious and I ended up dipping my chicken in them.Overall the portion to price ratio was pretty good, although I wasn't very happy about how expensive my meal was considering I didn't much care for the chicken which was most of my dinner.Delivery speed was really quick probably about 30 minutes but I actually think the delivery was the reason I didn't enjoy my food. Often times with delivery things sit around and get overcooked in the process. I think if I am ever to try Sitara, or any Indian food again, I will definitely go into the actual restaurant. From the pictures I've looked at, most Indian food looks very moist and saucy which is what I was hoping mine would be, but it was kind of dry.

<Content> Came in for lunch and had the chicken vindaloo. The curry was good, had good flavor and the right amount of spiciness. I have tried all but 1 other of the Indian restaurants in the CU area and this is at the top of the list so far.1 star deducted for 2 reasons:1. Service was subpar. The glass of water I got was lukewarm. Had maybe 1 sip of water left in the glass and the server looked at my table, walked by a few times without refilling, went back behind the bar and was on his phone. About the 4th time he finally came back and finally refilled the water....with more lukewarm water.2. The vindaloo had broccoli in it. I've had vindaloo plenty of times and have had different places add a variety of veggies, but never crunchy broccoli. It was kind of random and kind of seemed like it was a random vegetable added to the dish to stay true to the menu that said "a curry with assorted veggies". Honestly it took away from the dish. I would most probably come back here and try another dish and hope that service is a little better.

<Content> Lunch special Thalis offer a nice variety. Otherwise, the rice dishes, e.g number 37, is another great option for people who enjoy tasting a little bit of everything, and want to avoid the stress of deciding which curries and rice or naan to order a la carte. Fair prices, tasty food, and comfortable location.

<Content> It's a shame that I had to give this place only a 3 star rating, even though the food was quite good and I have recently started to really like Indian food. The problem was the service. I'm normally not picky about service, as long as I get what I ordered I'm happy. But decide for yourself whether the following is acceptable to you. They're supposed to open at 4:30, and we arrived at 4:35 to find the door closed and locked. My wife and I then walked around the block for a few minutes to wait, came back, and the place still wasn't open. I peered through the window to check if anyone was inside, and made eye contact with two of the restaurant staff. They stared at me, then went back to chatting with each other (they weren't even busy preparing tables or anything). By this time it was around 4:45.Once inside, we basically got the cold shoulder treatment, as if they were being passive-aggressive about my peering inside earlier. No smiles, no welcoming attitude, and when they came to take our order they just stood next to us without saying or asking anything. We ordered a lot so we had plenty left over, and specifically asked for TWO boxes to go, and they only brought one of the small boxes, which was clearly inadequate for how much we had left. So in summary, 4/5 for the food, 1/5 for the service, 3/5 overall.

<Content> We live in Chicago and have some pretty amazing Indian food up there. But since we come to Champaign/Urbana often I was so pumped to hear about this place opening.We came in and we were literally the only other people in there which was kind of a bummer. There was also no real signage out front and no real decoration inside. I've been to that space when it was the pizza place, and then when it was Red Star before that and not much has changed besides the fact that there were Bollywood movies playing.The service was fine, maybe a touch slow given that there was no one else there, but everyone was pleasant. The food was good too, perfectly spicy (and like spicy). I would surely come back. The only thing that worries me is the fact that they've failed health inspections. So what would've been a four star spot is now at two.

<Content> My wife and I ate here for the first time this Father's Day (2014). The restaurant is small and can easily be missed if you drive by in the car. There is no street parking, but there is ample parking in the structure immediately behind Sitara (and parking in the structure currently is free on weekends and on weekday evenings). Inside it is clearly a former bar. Lots of wood, a beautiful bar; a few booths and small tables line the South side of Sitara. Service was excellent. We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and seated immediately. The lunch menu is extensive, with sections for appetizers, vegetable dishes, lamb dishes, fish dishes, chicken dishes, bread dishes, and rice dishes (each with as few as 10 or as many as 20 listings). When we visited the prices began at 7.99, with most at 9.99. Meals include either naan or rice and an entree. We tried a lamb and a fish dish, and we both liked both of them. We also had an appetizer of vegetables prepared tempura-like with delicious sauces.Our water and drink glasses were never less than half full and both our waiter and other employees checked on us several times during the meal, making sure the food was good, hot, spiced properly, etc. There were several tables with children, but there doesn't appear to be a children's menu. (They may have one, but we didn't see it.) The tables are small and close together, so it may be difficult for a person in a wheelchair or walker. The naan was freshly made when we ordered it, and it was delicious. Just a slight puff, but still dense; you could taste the char-grill on it, just right, as should be the case. The lamb was tender and plentiful in the sauce. The fish was excellent too, though to my taste the sauce overwhelmed the fish flavor a little too much. Tasty, but I prefered the lamb because the balance of meat and sauce flavors let the best of both come through.There were several flat screen televisions playing Indian music videos. They were not unpleasant-- not too loud and one could easily talk and be heard. All in all I like Sitara a lot and recommend it highly. Everything is freshly made and delicious. We will definitely return to try other menu items!

<Content> I was overjoyed that an Indian restaurant opening up in downtown Urbana! And I was right to be excited - this place is wonderful. The service is quick and the food was great. I was dining in for once, and ordered the Vegetarian Thali dish, and I cannot recommend it enough - it's a crazy amount of food for $7.I've heard that Sitara might be owned by or otherwise connected to Bombay Grill, and I will say the food tastes very similar. Fortunately for me I also love Bombay Grill. :)

<Content> I am definitely a fan of the food at Sitara. The quality of the food is good, and the flavors are spot on. I've done both eating in and take out, and I would suggest doing take out if you're short on time because the service can be a bit slow. I personally feel like the entrees could be just a little bit bigger, and I wish they would add onion chutney to their chutney offerings.

<Content> Went back again for take out. Portions were great and the flavor was above average. Ordered the lamb vindaloo, and got a heaping container of vindaloo and another good sized container for rice. And the garlic naan was very very good. When I stopped by to pick it up I asked one of the staff members why Somosa wasn't on the menu, he said "it's on the dinner menu, you can ask for it any time"Very helpful and friendly staff. Food is still good and at a fair price.

<Content> Sitara opened on Tuesday, September 3, 2013. The owner used to be the counterman at Bombay at 4th & Green in campus.Unlike Bombay, Sitara serves on china plates with metal flatware, waiter service and nicer digs all around.I had the spicy fish chili for $7.99 at lunch. The Fish Chili has large chucks of whitefish and green peppers in a hot brown sauce. Excellent, with a nice kick to it. This place will be a regular lunch stop for Downtown Urbana folks. Prices are reasonable, about the same as the Bombay at 4th & Green, but not eating off of styrofoam with plastic forks. Lunch entrees were $5.99, $6.99 and $7.99.Sitara is in the space formerly occupied by the Embassy, The Red Star Liquors, and Black Rock Pizza; all across the street from Busey Bank's parking lot on Race Street between Elm and Main.

<Content> Went here for the first time with coworkers at lunch on 9/25. It was an excellent experience. The three of us each had samosa as appetizers (they're not on the lunch menu, but just ask for them) and we shared three entres, along with plain and garlic naan.The samosa were excellent, with good flavor and a healthy kick - probably the tastiest samosas I've had in a while. The coriander chutney was deliciously fresh, and one coworker who accompanied me said it was reminiscent of the way she liked it back home in India.The naan (garlic and plain) was delicious, and our main courses - two chicken dishes and channa masala also met with our satisfaction. The two different chicken dishes had distinct flavors with a good level of spice and flavor. The channa masala was also delicious; we asked them to crank up the heat on this one, and they obliged.We were all pleased with our meal, and the price was fair for the quantity and quality of food. The entres are served in brass bowls with china plates.It's hard to believe that a mere dozen years ago, we had NO Indian cuisine in Champaign-Urbana; we now have several excellent choices including Sitara, both on-campus and off.We will definitely be back. This fine Indian restaurant is a great addition to the dining options in downtown Urbana.

<Content> I visited Sitara just after they had opened. There was a surprise inspection there at the same time. They had to shut off their oven ( which makes me wonder what was wrong in the first place) due to which we could not get any type of breads that we had previously ordered. This was told to us after waiting 30-40 mins for the food. They just got the curry along with rice and told us this is all they can make right now. No apologies, nothing. I heard good reviews about the food and went back to give it another shot. But the food failed to impress me. I tried a couple of different chicken dishes. The food was just average. Nothing great. I even tried a bread other than the Naan. It was nothing like what it is supposed to be ( I am from India and I know what I'm ordering)

<Content> Sitara was a pleasant surprise in the Indian food scheme of the C-U area, with good flavors and a casual but comfortable ambience. The tandoori chicken was pleasantly tender and moist (a hit-or-miss in C-U). Prices in general are OK, at $9-12 for entrees. The only complaint is that the staff didn't cut up the naan, which made eating and sharing a bit awkward. Stop by if you're in the area, for a casual lunch or dinner experience.

<Content> After hearing from a friend that the Chef and manager who had previously worked at Bombay was working at this new restaurant, we had to go. My girlfriend and I had been going to Bombay almost every week for two years but noticed a gradual decline in the quality of the food. The food we were looking for was at Sitara.The food was just as great as it was before. I always get the chicken korma 2x spicy while my girlfriend gets the (Sitara) chicken aloo also 2x spicy. The naan amazing and a must-have.The only reason I am giving this a 4 is because the service is very dependent upon your server. Sometimes everything will be perfect, other times you'll be ignored from the time you get your food to when you get the check handed to you without a thing being said.

<Content> Update: I had previously written the bellow review with 4 stars. However, I must now change it to 1 or even less. I just called them to make an order for pickup. I am not Indian and am not the most sophisticated when it comes to Indian food. I tried asking a few questions about their Chicken Chili before making my order. The guy on the other end was extremely short with me and even hung up on me. If this is how they treat people then I will not be going back. My post can be updated again with a good response from management. Previous Post: We ate at Sitara the other night. I had one of the paneer dishes and thought it was outstanding. I also ordered two orders of naan. The naan was huge, the size of a blanket (slight exaggeration). Our waiter, Johnny Bravo, did a wonderful job. I didn't give this five stars because I decided to be more picky in my reviews. I would definitely recommend this place.

<Content> BEWARE of this place. They do not use a calculator for some reason to add up your bill and end up charging you more. Most people wont notice it but clearly they do it more than often. I am pretty sure its not a mistake because it has happened more than twice.Also, while ordering they DO NOT specify if rice is extra or if they are trying to cross sell a product, they make it sound as if it comes with the entree. I would be careful of their practices. Finally, the quality of food is no different than bombay grill... its same old bombay grill type of food.

<Content> Quite easily the best (Northern) Indian restaurant in Champaign-Urbana, and one of the best I've been to anywhere. The food is fresh, and the range of flavors broad and well balanced. Spice level is very moderate and can be increased on request for those desiring a more invigorating experience. The napkins are cloth and quite absorbent, very capable of handling a level 3 Vendaloo's worth of forehead sweat.I'd list the dishes I prefer but they have all been excellent and I have no one favorite, though I do get the fish curry and chicken do pyaza more frequently than others. I love rice but choose paratha nine times out of ten, only occasionally getting rice or garlic naan. The samosas are perfect and don't forget the tamarind sauce, which is a great highlight to the main dish also.I'm not sure how anyone could give this place one star, especially having not even tried the food. The owner Bobby is a straight shooter, by all means check your ticket but I find it difficult to believe he or his staff are cheating the totals.

<Content> Love the decor and the food is even better to me than Bombay. Nice people working there. I love the lamb vindaloo for $9 at lunch.

<Content> Oh. My. Goodness. They have an actual tandoor oven back there somewhere, and does it ever make a difference! I fell totally in love with the moist, flavorful garlic tandoori chicken. (It'll give you a heck of a breath, but it's worth it.) This knocks the other northern Indian restaurants in C-U right out.We went for dinner and had quite a wait; ended up eating at the bar, but that was okay. Next time we'll make sure to call ahead. The service was erratic--they were very short-staffed that night, and I expect they will probably work this out by the next time we go--but friendly. We had the chance to speak a bit with the owner, who was very friendly and informative. We will absolutely be going again.

<Content> Had lunch with friends and we each ordered a dish. Palak paneer, chicken tikka masala , aloo Gobi, and butter chicken all were excellent. I cannot wait to go again.

<Content> Sitara is an amazing restaurant. The service is great and the food is amazing. My 5 year old little girl absolutely loves to eat at Sitara. My other 2 children love the food just as much as their 5 year old sister. When we go there and sit down and eat my children love to watch the Indian videos that they have playing on the TV's. The service is always quick and they are very attentive to what is going on around with each customer (even when they are super busy) . The food is always amazing. The cheese naan is very tasty. We all would say Sitara is the best Indian food in Champaign-Urbana. Sitara is the only Indian restaurant we will ever eat at again! Thank you for such great service and the amazing food. All 3 of my children get to pick where they go for their birthday dinner and it has been Sitara for all 3 of them!!!!

<Content> Really good Indian, especially enjoyed the chicken tiki marsala and the naan. The yellow dal was a little runny for my personal taste, but still very flavorful. Generally good service (I have a toddler, and they were VERY supportive and attentive to what we needed), although a couple missteps. All in all, we're headed back again!

<Content> First time here and I had an ok experience. It's located two doors down from the Iron Post in Urbana.  The restaurant looks like a bar.... A really long bar with a dozen seats....not sure what the purpose of it was....I guess they didn't bother renovating from the previous tenants. Then a bunch of booths and a few tables.... Think Black Dog but with more room.  I had my 1yr old with me and figured she'd love some chicken korma and rice. She LOVES rice... But not here... korma is usually fairly mild (as stated in their menu) with lots of flavor, but this had a bit of a kick to it....my nose was running. After three bites, she was spitting it out and pushing it away.  I also ordered some samosas, and they were really good, but again a bit of a kick and my daughter didn't like them. We tried ordering a mango lassi from the menu, but the waiter said that they had a mango shake....i asked what the difference was and he just shrugged his shoulders and said, "They're similar".  Similar as in how? He couldn't tell me.  He suggested mango juice, so I agreed and he basically sat a glass of mango concentrate in front of me.... Kind of gross. From where we were seated, i had a decent view of the kitchen....I saw them putting a lot of things in the microwave....heard lots of beeping as dish after dish finished in there...not sure what they were nuking... Kind of made me uneasy.... I've been in enough restaurants, cooking classes and seen enough food network to know that microwaves aren't really used that often or at all?!  Anyway, it was ok...but I'd opt for Bombay Indian Grill any day of the week.

<Content> Had the thaili(not sure if I spelt the name correct. It's on the last page of the menu) lunch. It was only $8.99, but contains chicken, rice, salad, and dessert! Like their Dessert very much. It was a kind of milk dessert, and seems contains rice. Creamy but not very sweet. And the sweet yogurt drink Tassi was also very good. It could be better if they have some cooked vegetables in the chicken meal.

<Content> This is now my favorite Indian place in town. The food was hot and good, portions were a bit small as usual with most indian places but it was still plenty for leftovers with some naan & two entrees. The vegetable korma is the best in town.

<Content> Owned by previous manager and Chef of Bombay Grill. Nice start, careful handling of customers. Maybe need to prune their menu, it is expansive. Recommended as the best option in Champaign-Urbana for Indian .....not saying much :-(

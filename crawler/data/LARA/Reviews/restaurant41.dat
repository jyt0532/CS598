<Content> On a quick weekend road trip to CU, I wanted a local coffee shop downtown--and Yelp definitely delivered with all the recommendations for Aroma Cafe!This is a cute little shop nestled in the adorable downtown Champaign area, and on a Sunday morning, it was easy to get in and quickly get a drink and some breakfast. It's mostly street parking, but I found lots of spots right out front.The lovely lady working welcomed us right away, and she was very helpful with her suggestions. I decided on a large light roast Ethiopian and an oatmeal, and the Mister got a large dark roast of some sort and a cinnamon roll as big as my head. The ceramic coffee mugs were huge, and the coffee was delicious. They even had organic cane syrup to sweeten it! My oatmeal was pre-packaged, but it was one of the healthier brands without anything artificial or tons of sugar. The Mister loved his goodies as well.The interior of Aroma Cafe is very cozy, but we decided to sit on the patio out back. It felt secret garden-ish, and it was the perfect setting for a lazy Sunday breakfast. If you're in the CU area, then you should totally check out this place. Friendly people, good coffee, and tasty treats... what else could you want?

<Content> The coffee is okay. It isn't bad coffee. The staff is very friendly and answers questions politely. The seating isn't like your typical coffee shop. It has a nice fireplace in the back and for outdoor seating there is a cool-looking back patio to sit in. They have tons of outdoor seating. They are never as packed as Kopi and it is quieter than Kopi. My favorite drink to get here is the Italian cream soda with the many different flavors they offer. This place has a lot going for it, I wish I could say their coffee is amazing that is why I can't give it a higher rating. You should check this place out.

<Content> Great customer service! The barista was really pleasant and inviting. He combined two bags of tea to create what I wanted, and seemed happy to do it. Casual ambience and I liked that there was a couch in the back. My tea was great and I got a lot of it for just $2... I'll definitely be returning. :)

<Content> I asked the staff what the best flavor was for the coffee (since they have so many), and they created me the most delicious thing ever. It was some kind of mocha toffee iced coffee, and I've been dreaming of it ever since I graduated and moved away from Champaign. Also, their mac and cheese is the bomb, even though you have to microwave it yourself.

<Content> I walked here after visiting Cafe Kopi (it's a 2 minute walk away) on a Saturday morning around 11 a.m.Aroma Cafe is smaller than Cafe Kopi and has an even more boring atmosphere (I also gave Cafe Kopi 3 stars). On the plus side, there is also a work/study atmosphere here at Aroma Cafe just like there was at Cafe Kopi.I ordered the Peach Green Tea for here which came in a red mug on a saucer. I was given the mug with the tea bag still in it, which I appreciated, but wish I was also given a small spoon in order to fish it out once my tea is done steeping. Now the only options I have are: 1) leave the tea bag in there; 2) fish the tea bag out with my fingers; or reluctantly 3) I could go back up to the counter and ask for a spoon...but that's one extra trip too many.My tea tasted fine...but nothing I will remember by the time I leave this shop. Even though I didn't really like Cafe Kopi either--it's still a step up from Aroma Cafe.

<Content> I've been very faithful to Cafe Kopi over the years - however - my beloved chai latte and chai bomb are consistently inconsistent. I decided to give Aroma a try after my last disappointing latte and I was very pleased. My son also prefers the hot chocolate here as well. I recently discovered their hummus which comes with plenty of flatbread and house made fattoush. It is sinfully delish. Unfortunately for me (and my coworkers) it is dragon breath inducing with all the fantastic ingredients. Their lobster bisque is also to die for. Maybe not that serious, but it's worth a try. The fresh grilled ciabatta that comes with it is perfect.Now I'm hungry. Thanks, Yelp.

<Content> What a lovely place to get overpriced coffee!I thought I was in Champaign not Chicago!?I don't get why everything around here is so expensive. I got a small coffee to go and a slice of banana bread. I think it was from next store at Pekara (menu said "baked goods from a local bakery). It doesn't get more local than right next store! I will say the coffee was great! This seems like a local sandwich and soup place that twenty and thirty somethings visit frequently. I won't be one of them, but a nice little spot nonetheless!You must be a hipster doofus, barista, or bum who writes poetry to work or dine here to feel comfortable. I hate the coffee house culture where you just sit back and steal WiFi. Maybe that is why they are so expensive?I would come back for the coffee but not if I see a Dunkin Donuts first! I also had to help the cashier do some math with my change...but I ended up giving her all of it anyways. Nice staff!

<Content> This is the best coffee place in Champaign. Both the coffee and the service are excellent. They also do a nice line in baked goods, so it's a great place to get a break and a snack - plenty of seating, so you can work here on the free wifi while you munch on your scone and sip your Americano (by the way, it didn't take the staff long to know exactly what I was going to ask for).

<Content> update 5/8/09Yuck to their pastries. Every time I go here (not too often, but if Kopi is crowded or has rudely turned off their internet) their hours have changed. Now the sign says "For Now Hours" so who knows what it will be next time? They didn't have anything that looked that tempting, but I had a huge sweet tooth, and tried a brownie. It was hard as a rock. I should have taken it back, but I didn't because I would have had to sit their and drink my coffee anyway since I was given one of their tiny "here" cups (which probably wouldn't have taken me too long in reality).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~update 11/15/2008:I have dropped Aroma just an "eh" rating...Cafe Kopi was horribly crowded, so I trudged back out into the cold and headed to Aroma. There was a nice size table free, and it's much brighter in there (which I found jarring at first, but got used to it). I ordered my standard "Grande House Coffee" and when asked "for here or to go" I said "for here" because I had planned to stay to do some homework. Well she gave me my coffee in this tiny little mug. I asked her, "Is this a grande?" and she looked at me, said yes, and showed me an even tinier mug for their smalls. There was not 16 oz of hot coffee in that tea cup. Barely 12 oz would be my guess. They TOTALLY short change you on the "for here" cups, so I would recommend getting a "to go" cup even if you plan on staying. Which is unfortunate when "going green" is the thing to do... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~On an early Sunday right after moving to Champaign, I was wandering around the downtown area to see what was around, and stopped in here for a coffee and a muffin. It's cute, there's lots of tables, free WiFi (although I didn't have my computer, I saw a couple of people with laptops out), and the people behind the counter were nice. There's a comfy spot in the back with couches and chairs and a fireplace! (not sure if it works though) And they have an outdoor area as well. The coffee was good, and if you buy one of their travel mugs, you get a discount every time you bring it in to get your coffee. The hours are great for studying. Overall: it's cute, and I can see myself heading back there in the future.

<Content> Under new ownership, Aroma is re-inventing herself as a cozy alternative in downtown Champaign. Warm byzantium hues fit perfectly with the charm of the new 'sexy toast' creations with fillings that range from fresh roasted portobellos with charred red capsicum to wonderfully tender beef short-ribs with a delicate horseradish cream sauce. Understated Middle-Eastern sides like hummus and tabouleh further enhance a menu that still includes classic Aroma fare like the Cuban sandwich and quesadillas.Aroma has come a long way in a short time. I look forward to future encounters.

<Content> This cafe was a very pleasant surprise for breakfast. Every item I tried was surprisingly good.The organic coffee came in a huge mug, bigger than most soup cups and had a really nice smooth and only slightly bitter taste. If you enjoy Intelligensia I'm sure you'd enjoy this one as well. The Italian soda was pretty normal, using Da Vinci syrup.Both the roast beef wrap and mango chicken wrap were fresh and light with a good mix of flavors. The cream cheese is from local sources which you can clearly taste from the first bite. The sides of salad and fruit were both fresh and flavorful.I will definitely return here on my next trip downstate.

<Content> Aroma is my cappuccino stop on a sunny Sunday afternoon walk. Which makes me neither a laptop-toting regular, nor a complete one-timer. The caps are usually good -- until last Sunday. The tired guy behind the counter was in a big hurry to get on with his life, apparently, because instead of a cappuccino, he made a latte. The other guy behind the counter practically argued with me when I explained the drink was "wrong" simply by the sheer weight of the cup. Finally, they redid it, but it was still the worst cappuccino I have ever had there.The atmosphere is nice, and food is not bad. However, the snack selection is practically non-existent. For that, you gotta hit Pekara next door.Odd Aroma Cafe story: one Sunday, I ask for a San Pellegrino. The tall kid behind the counter says he can't serve it to me. "Why?" I ask. "Because I'm under-age" comes the answer. Wooot! You gotta be kidding, kid. After picking myself up off the floor, I explain it's fizzy water, he asks someone for help, I get the bottle (no brown paper bag) and we get outta there. And with this story, I just realized I am one step closer to the yuppies I'd always mocked. Well, I will suck it up.

<Content> Best coffee in Downtown Champaign. Better than Kopi, Expresso Royale and MUCH better than Pekara and Merry Anns. Coffees change daily, and they always have a pot ready regardless of the crowd. I always get a regular ol' coffee, but people who get the froofy drinks also think that Aroma is on top of their game.The staff is always friendly and helpful to me, though some have told me they have experienced worse, but then again, I know a lot of assholes. The food is good, but their portions are a little small. A lunch with a large coffee is always $8-9. For $5.95 pretax, you get one of their sandwiches and moderately generous side of fruit salad, salad, or chips. They are cheaper than Pekara and Kopi. Make sure you check out their soup of the day, as they are always good and a soup and an Aroma sandwich combo is guaranteed to satisfy. They have pastries for sale, but I don't know why. The pastries at Pekara (next door) are way better. They also have a morning Bagel and Coffee deal for $3.50 that is pretty good: they have a bunch of different bagel and cream cheese varieties.They also offer a discount if your work in Downtown Champaign, but they do not advertise this.

<Content> In a time where hamburgers are cheaper than fresh greens aroma stands out offering a diverse menu of fresh food for a reasonable price. The light healthy taste of the food is paired perfectly with the open air well lit space. Aroma is a restraunt that is something the American people need in order to get our countrys economy, weight, and sense of community back on track. The menu was recently revamped. So if you havnt been here in 6 months give it another shot. My experience today was flawless. The atmosphere is upbeat, well lit, and friendly. The staff is friendly, personable, and knowledgable. The food was delivered to my table in a timely manner, presented with care, and was quality product. I will be coming here for lunch more often.

<Content> Another great downtown coffee shop. They have a nice outdoor patio and a cozy section in the back with couches and armchairs. They also have local musicians play some nights which can be quite enjoyable. The coffee and atmosphere are pretty good. Seating can be a little sparse and when it's crowded, it can be a bit hard to move around.I don't have any complaints really, but Aroma doesn't quite have the draw for me that other downtown coffee shops have.

<Content> I would give Aroma more stars if I could! Aroma has a great staff that greets you with a smile. I noticed that the staff knew other costumers by name and asked them how their day was etc...nice to see that they value their costumers. You don't get that in other coffee shop in this area!  Every latte I've had from Aroma has been simply delicious and perfect to taste. You should definitely try the cranberry and brie sexy toast! It's taste like a slice of thanksgiving in your mouth...I crave it often! Also try their soups! They always change up their soup menu, can't go wrong! One thing that I really enjoy about this spot is it's an older crowd not a ton of college kids that are camping out like Kopi so there's always a place for you to relax while you sip away on your coffee.

<Content> I was a bit disappointed by Aroma. My iced mocha tasted like chocolate milk (was there half a shot in there, or what?) and the veggie wrap was only "meh" although it sounded really great on the menu.My drink tasted alright, despite lacking any kick, but the price is really what made it bad. For a SMALL espresso drink that didn't taste like it had any espresso in it, I paid $3.80. Whaa?I do like that the sandwiches and such come with a choice of side, and that none of the sides will cost you extra. At Cafe Kopi, you have to pay extra for certain sides, including the side salad. I liked the salad that came with my wrap, although there were a few pieces of wilted/gross lettuce. I was underwhelmed by the wrap but would probably try a full-size salad from here.However, since Cafe Kopi is right around the corner and serves way better drinks, I don't know if I'll ever bother giving Aroma Cafe a second chance.

<Content> On my quarterly-ish trips up to Champaign to see a friend, we usually find ourselves downtown walking around. This past weekend we had some time to kill before lunch so we stopped in Aroma for a drink. It was a gorgeous Saturday so we were able to take advantage of their backyard patio. It's pretty much your average coffee shop, but a few things stand out. One - they have sugar free almond syrup. Yum! It's one of my favorite flavors, but rarely do I find it in the sugar free variety. Two - they have a fireplace. I'm assuming it works, although I've never actually been in Aroma when it's on. Third - they have a nice patio. Although I really wish they would upgrade their patio chairs. They have the flimsy plastic kind that suck. Spend a few more bucks and get something similar to your neighbor, Pekara.Their bakery case never looks too appealing. I'd skip on over to Pekara if you're looking for a nosh, but Aroma is a-ok for a coffee or tea.

To support this claim, I had a cup of cocoa here, two hours later went to another caf to try their cocoa, and immediately returned to have another cup of cocoa here. (I really need to watch my sugar intake.)Nice place to study, great place for a study date. There's an outdoor area too, but I have not checked it out.

<Content> I quite like Aroma. It's your typical cafe, but they have a fairly wide variety of menu items and you get a good deal with their daily specials.They have lots of seating indoors (including some cushy chairs by a fireplace in the back), and something I especially appreciated was the abundance of outlets! There's nothing more frustrating than getting to a cafe that either a) has wireless, but you gotta pay for it, or b) has free wireless, but only two outlets for the patrons to fight over.After ordering my hummus plate, I grabbed a table by the wall, plugged myself in, connected to the free internet, and spent a nice evening relaxing.... at least that's what I would've liked to have said. I was actually scrambling to finish an assignment before they closed up for the day, haha. The warm pita bread and fresh, crisp cucumbers that came with the hummus was very tasty though =)They have a bunch of outdoor seating out back as well for when the weather is nice.

My companion had a cup of Jambalaya and turkey toast and a cup of tea. There were quite a few customers enjoying the cozy atmosphere and free WiFi.

<Content> I came to Aroma to have lunch and study. A failure on both counts.I ordered a surprisingly small amount of food for about 8 dollars. The quality was meh, and I had to order more to get full. If I'm going to spend 10-12 dollars on lunch, I can have much more satisfying experiences elsewhere.Studying was difficult. The embarrassing light jazz track that they were playing was way too loud, and much more appropriate for, say, a hotel lobby than a downtown cafe.

Your workers were ridiculously friendly, your huge ass coffee mugs were on point, and the Beef and Cheddar sandwich was sabroso. You win.

Plenty of seating (including, I believe, a patio in the back), free wireless, nice decor and lighting, friendly staff: everything you need from a good coffee shop. They have food too (mostly sandwiches, salads etc): I tried their raspberry chipotle chicken salad, and it was pretty good.

<Content> I worked at Aroma Cafe, on Neil between Park and University, for 2 1/2 years, so I can safely say that I've eaten just about anything that could come out of their kitchen. It's not amazing, but it's all good stuff. The kids quesadilla is the best deal on the menu. There's front and back patio seating, which can be important as seating indoors fills up quickly when school is in session. They have music Thursday nights which can be very hit or miss.

Aroma's patio is adjacent to Pekara Bistro's patio. So, you can get a latte from Aroma, a crepe from Pekara, and have an excellent Sunday afternoon lunch.

<Content> I practically live at this coffee shop. The atmosphere is usually quieter than Kopi, and there is plenty of seating on most days; the staff is friendly and polite and know their way around a kitchen. There are outlets all along the walls, and free wifi, if that's what you're looking for. *See edit*I'm addicted to the vanilla chai, but I really go there for the raspberry white chocolate scones. I challenge you to find a better scone in the world! Okay, well, maybe not the world, but they trump any pastry in every coffee shop I've ever visited. When I've been on the road, this is the first place I come back to. Aroma is home!Also, the salsa here is amazing. It is house-made and there are two kinds: try the one with the peaches. I get it as a side with my cheese quesadilla, which is also tasty and totally worth spending my lunch money on!Edit: 5/20/2012Since I last reviewed Aroma, it has gone through a lot of changes, including new ownership. What's bad about this is they took away almost every single thing I loved. Those unparalleled raspberry white chocolate scones? Gone. Now they serve bloated English scones from Sweet Indulgences that are as dry and tasteless as the Sahara. Massive, extraordinary fail. I mean, there used to be epic Scone Wars over Aroma's scones--I used to try to beat these elderly ladies who worked downtown to the cafe to get my share. For real. Now the new scones just sit on a plate, untouched and unwanted, fat blobs of loathing. Anybody who likes them never had the original, heavenly scones of old. They're not even in the same category of pastry, I tell you. They offer other pastries from Sweet Indulgences, too, but they're all really expensive and not what I would eat for breakfast. (Old habits die hard.) They still sell apple fritters, I guess.They tried to get rid of my beloved chai, as well, but then the new baristas were too mentally challenged to make bagged chai tea and they had to revert back to the mix. I guess leaving a tea bag in a cup of steamed milk requires too much comprehension. I'm glad for it, anyway, because if natural bagged chai is your thing, nobody in town is better than Kopi, which is just around the block. Competing against them is just a waste of time, so they're safer to keep the chai mix and go with what their customers already know and love.Also, that amazing peach salsa? Yup, it's gone now, too. Forever. The whole menu has been revamped to have fancier, slightly healthier offering. I haven't been desperate enough to try any of their new food items except for the fruit salad, which is basically a bowl of chopped fruit with a yummy syrup over it, and that was good, but it was just for breakfast. I will say they seem to have spared most of their old menu's wraps and other lunch items for the time being. The Wi-Fi is also password-protected now ("sexytoast" is the key). At least they didn't insert that proposed "kid corner" they threatened us with earlier during the revamp. That would've sent me running for the hills instantly. As someone who comes in here regularly to find quiet and write, I can tell you the very last thing I want is to share space with a corner of screaming, running toddlers. I deducted Aroma a star for all of this, but find it hard to give it less than 4 stars. I've been coming to Aroma for seven years, so I think of it as my home away from home, even if it currently is a shell of what it once was. Some of the other regular customers I used to see in here are thinning out. I guess all of this will make it easier for when I move from Champaign, because now it's just depressing.

<Content> This cafe is usually crowded, and for good reason. It's got a great ambiance, it's comfortable, the food and drinks are good, the baristas know what they're doing, and it's in a great location in downtown Champaign. The menu has more "real" food than most coffeeshops, including hummus and cheese plates, as well as a very tempting selection of sweets. The Chai is delicious, but vegans beware, Big Train brand chai contains milk powder (as I learned from a helpful barista here). Of course, there is free Wifi. In a city of comfy coffee shops, this one is a great recent addition.

<Content> My rating's based on Champaign-Urbana coffee houses, not other cities. I mean of course Chicago or New York has MUCH better coffee houses than Aroma Cafe, but if you're in Champaign-Urbana Aroma Cafe is as good as it gets, at least coffee wise. Enviornment: 3.5/5, Drinks: 5/5Their prices are insanely reasonable and they give out a generous discount for bringing your own cup. The quality of the beans is also very good, which rocks. While Cafe Kopi (the coffee house just a street away from Aroma Cafe) roasts very well too, they can't make drinks worth shit. They don't even know how to steam milk! I got a latte their once and the milk wasn't steamed, just warmed up with the steam wand. I also rate Aroma Cafe highly because their prep, the way they make the drinks, is very good. Aroma Cafe actually uses a manual grinder for their espresso drinks! It's amazing! :D Most places just put the group head into an automatic. Their back bar might need a tid bit of work but I mean I'm getting really picky. I just feel bad for the usual lone barista doing all of the work.In any case, if you're in Champaign-Urbana and want a quality cup of coffee this is the place to go. Cafe' Paradiso's just too expensive and every other coffe house has no idea what their doing.

<Content> Aroma is tiny but mighty! The drinks are awesome. The best Chai I've ever had. The food-- codenamed "Sexytoast" -- looks really good, but we only got the hummus plate and it was fine. A light snack for two people with two drinks for $10? Not bad.

<Content> Cafe Aroma was a very pleasant place to kill time for a few hours. The food was good (I had a pesto and tomato grilled sandwich - yum!) and so was the coffee. The people were very nice. Seemed like a smaller seating area and less of a cozy atmosphere compared with Cafe Kopi around the corner. Otherwise the two were comparable and I could happily spend time in either one again.

<Content> *disclaimer* im writing this review on my memories from literally living in this place 5+ years ago. with that said......i finished my college career at this place! in a year, i think i spent more time here than my own room!their coffee is amazing... and the price is right for college students and those on a budget. their carb selection along with special menu items were always fresh. :)i do recall them having awesome salsas! i think i was about 3 americanos deep and needed to cleanse the coffee scum out of my mouth.. (eww, gross, sorry). they had a mango salsa special on the board and i have been making my mango salsa as they did ever since (or try to.. hehe).i miss this place. it's small, cozy, the staff there were always friendly and their music selection was always on point!

<Content> Admittedly tried to go to Kopi first and was immediately turned away by the sign on the door that said NO WIFI ON WEEKENDS. Fine, fine...So off to Aroma we went and glad we landed here. It's not quite the cozy place Kopi seemed to be but the coffee is good and I like the fireplace area in the back near where we sat. Staff was also quite friendly even though it was pretty early on a Sunday morning. And oh yeah, they have wifi on the weekends. One thing they could cut back on is the muzak going in the background. Maybe the rest of the clientele like the slow jazz, dunno.

<Content> I moved here from the Bay Area, the second largest coffeehouse metropolis outside of possibly Seattle. My first week in town consisted primarily of the hunt for "the right" coffee shop where the words "extra foamy" meant the wet foam, not dry, to provide a perfect foundation for latte art. If you know latte, then you must know Cafe Aroma. The consistency from barista to barista is not the same, so I send a word of caution. I have my favorite latte rainmaker, and I ask him for his schedule so I can come when he's there. I'm serious. The owner also is there often, and he absolutely knows what he is doing when it comes to making the perfect latte. Things like this are too important to play with. Go straight to Cafe Aroma and save yourself $30 of bad experimentation at the other coffee shops in town.

<Content> Best coffeehouse in town. The barristas are cool, especially Nicole. Their food is also great, especially the black-bean and corn quesadilla. The salads and wraps are way better than Pekara and way cheaper too. I wish they had more tables and more outlets and they've always got their A/C running on high, but other than that, this place rocks!

<Content> The custom-made my chai tea latte without any sweetener and it was the best I've ever had. I got to hang out for 2-1/2 hours to do work while traveling and felt welcome the entire time. Good tunes at a good volume and nice place to work and drink chai.

<Content> Good atmosphere for studying or relaxing. Prices are reasonable in my opinion. I got the Sienna Turkey Wrap for lunch on a Saturday. It is very large and comes w/ one side. This is a cold wrap, and it is very very good, with a combo of ingredients that make it stand out over other "normal" wraps. I got the "aroma salad" as a side. It has goat cheese, nuts, berries and of course greens. This isn't what I usually like (nuts and berries in a salad), but it comes with house dressing, and it was very good as well. Total for the wrap and side (not including drink, as I got a free glass of water you pour yourself) was about $8. That's a good deal in my opinion, as 1/2 the wrap filled me up, and I'm a guy. It could easily be split between 2.

<Content> Before there was Aroma, I thought iced vanilla lattes were supposed to taste bitter and burnt (thank you Espresso Royale...). Now I know they are supposed to be sweet, creamy, fragrant, and oh so good. Aroma has some of the best coffee I've ever had (but it's definitely not cheap), as well as a variety of delicious real food. Store is cute, with a nice patio out back, but it's not the biggest place and if you're looking for a place to study and it's after lunch, you'll probably be out of luck here. Otherwise, it's one of my favorite places to camp out (provided I woke up early enough on a Saturday morning).

<Content> Try the a-latta bananas. Delicious!! I asked to hold back on the banana syrup, so it wouldn't be so overpowering. The staff is very friendly!! And if you purchase one of their travel mugs you get a drink free then get 20% any time you come back in with the cup!

<Content> It's not bad. They make a decent cup of coffee. More positives: pastries are affordable; ample seating; nice back patio area; baristas are pretty cool. That being said, the best coffee in town (and some of the best pastries) is at Das Cafe in Urbana, which has theirs custom blended by Colombia in Champaign. So I guess Colombia really gets the credit on that one.

<Content> My home away from home :-) I love the food, whether it's any of their sexy sandwiches or the turkey wrap, or one of the amazing desserts which are "just right"! I love the very friendly and cool staff too, and I love the casual atmosphere in which you can get a huge cup of coffee and open your laptop, read, and do your work for as long as you feel like. In my case, that usually means staying for hours and consuming two meals, it's that good. I am still looking for a place like this in Chicago.The only downside is the corrupt little ***hole that the city of Champaign is, which imagines itself to be downtown Chicago or Manhattan. In other words, the biggest problem with this place is that you need to run out every two hours to feed the stupid meter. But, of course, that's not Aroma's fault so they get 5 stars from me, and if you read my other reviews, you'll see that I don't give out stars that easily.

<Content> what i love most about aroma is the outdoor seating. perfect in the spring/summer/early fall with an iced latte and a good book. what i love the least about aroma is the chai tea latte. for some reason, i don't know if it was the chai or the soy milk, it just wasn't good! however, i have been pleased by their other lattes (regular and vanilla), yet haven't tried any other coffee drinks thus far.i've also had their veggie wrap and grownup grilled cheese sandwich, which were both pretty good and worth getting again. the best i've had here is the mango salsa that comes with the sandwiches. don't know what it is, but i just love this stuff (i think because of it's simplicity). the space of aroma is ok...i've definitely had trouble getting seating inside because of the limited space, but usually it is okay.also love that they occasionally have live music. i have only been once when there was, and it was a pretty good experience....and overall, i've had okay experiences with the staff....nothing really to report about because there hasn't been anyone overly rude or overly friendly...just about what you'd expect from a place like this....

<Content> If Aroma was closer to my house, I would spend a lot of time here. As it is, I'm kind of stuck at Panera, which is a tad more expensive and boring. I like the atmosphere, though in my 40s I could use a little more light. I like VERY much the make-your-own-omelette, the cheese quesadillas, the buttered toast, and the fruit tart. As for the cafe mocha, I've had better. The lemonade was nasty, and had a pretty dreadful aftertaste (funky sweetener?) Service is okay, but could be a bit friendlier.

<Content> Wonderful, comfortably cheery atmosphere. It's so warm and cozy to sit here on a winter night with a hot beverage and a book, or a cheese plate and Scrabble with my husband. The drinks are wonderful; I haven't really had anything here I didn't like. In addition to the usual coffee/tea concoctions, they have juices and a few alcoholic beverages. The food is also quite good, unlike a lot of other coffee shops I've tried. Try the quesadilla or the Aroma Salad. Good music, too! My only beef with them is that they close super-early in the evenings during semester break, meaning that those of us who actually LIVE here don't get to partake while the students are gone. I would understand if Aroma were located closer to campus and got the vast majority of their business from college students, but every time I'm there, I see quite a few non-students, so I see no reason for them to close early.

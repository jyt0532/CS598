<Content> 5 for service. You get this blond hair female bartender, go to her!!! She's totally awesome and makes good recommendation. Food isn't bad either. Why the 4 stars? Yo, I ordered the chocolate de wannabe creme brle thingamajig and it only came with two slits of ginger snaps cookies (like the kind you pay 3 bucks for at ikea). I ordered two more of them rectangles and they charged me 50 cents! They charged me 50 cents for two rectangles of a graham cracker (remember a whole graham cracker has 4 rectangles). Man, as I eat those cookies I lost my appetite for the dessert (rarely happens). I didn't even want to take it home. I felt like I got carjacked and I wasn't even driving. Carjacked by ginger snap cookies, from ikea!!! Wtf!? Ahhh, but I'll be back. I'll just stay away from them cookies.

<Content> Food was creative but a bit off the mark: 4/5. Service was super slow and less than stellar: 2/5We arrived around 11:30 on a Sunday morning and were told we would have to wait 20-30 minutes since we hadn't made a reservation. Ok, fine that seemed reasonable enough and maybe would be a testament to the quality of the restaurant, I figured. Time easily killed by a walk around downtown. The hostess said that we could leave our phone number with them, and they would call us when it was our turn to be seated. A nice touch, I thought.We never received that phone call, but wandered back of our own accord some 15-20 minutes later, and our table was ready. We received menus promptly, and then spent the next fifteen minutes waiting for our waiter. When he finally showed up he did apologize for not coming by sooner, asked us if it was our first time there (yes, for myself and one other in my party), and then proceeded to describe Radio Maria's menu: the uniqueness of the Mexican inspired breakfast items, the deliciousness of the omelettes, etc. I think I would have really appreciated that primer if I had not already had the opportunity to read over the menu several times while we had been waiting for him to show up. He seemed really startled when we informed him we were actually ready to order, because clearly he was not ready to take them, citing the drinks he had to bring to another table. So cue another wait...All in all, we saw two tables that had been seated after us order food, receive their food, finish eating, and pay in the before we had gotten ours. Which points to less of a systemic problem (because, clearly, some patrons DO get their food in a timely manner), and maybe more of an individual issue. Our waiter did seem very harried, and I would venture to say even distressed, so maybe there is an issue with the division of work. I did notice that another employee stepped to help with water refills, but during only the last quarter of our meal.FOOD : We ordered: two veggie masa boats, vegetarian Eggs Benedict, Mexican coffees,and a side of beer bread.Rated from best to worst:Veggie masa boats (4.5/5): perfectly cooked eggs, and the masa black bean and tomato combo worked for me. What did not work: the goat cheese. I actually would have liked something a wee bit less salty and more melty, but I was in the minority at my table on this one.Vegetarian eggs Benedict (4/5): I guess I am used to versions with meat, but I could have done with a little more salt or other sort of seasoning. The slice of tomato/avocado combination didn't do anything for me.Beer bread (2/5): really dry and cakeyMexican coffee (1/5): Came with a half-inch of spice grounds at the bottom, and was cloyingly sweet (The upside to this is that a refill of regular coffee, added to the grounds, makes for an actually drinkable beverage).Overall... meh. I could overlook the service issues if the food were truly crave-worthy, but I did not find that to be the case.

<Content> Made the mistake of coming here for brunch Homecoming weekend. The service was incredibly slow. Took over an hour to get two breakfast dishes. I didn't get drinks but it did seem like people were enjoying their drinks orders. I ordered huevos rancheros with chorizo which is something I thought was hard to mess up. After the wait I was expecting greatness but this restaurant did not deliver. Eggs were over salted and the presentation was not appealing. Don't think I'll be back again.

<Content> Visited this restaurant for the first time with my girlfriend due to friend recommendation. And I have to say, it does live up to the hype. Since it was early in the morning on a weekend, we liked to start out our meal with some nice coffee. Not gonna lie, if you are looking to some authentic Mexican coffee, save it. Their coffee was not their highlight. They offered two specials that day: an omelette and a stuffed chili pepper. We listened to our friendly waiter's recommendation and ordered one of each. Their baked potatoes that accompanied the core of the meals were phenomenal! The temperature was perfectly controlled and all the pieces of the potatoes were cooked evenly, and just right. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with just the right amount of salt to make it appeal to the tongues. It is very hard for me to describe the main courses in details, since there was a lot going on, but just know that food is served in a timely fashion, and the impact of the flavors truly made the visit an overall enjoyable experience. Definitely keep a lookout on the specials if you want something more memorable.  The restaurant itself is very clean, and was decorated with interesting Hispanic things that created an unique atmosphere that made it ideal for 1 on 1 dining. Definitely would return to this place next time I am in town.

<Content> I come here for business every so often, usually on weeknights. Last weekend My wife and I decided to go for a date. We were seated promptly, and the restaurant was not full, but it was clear that there were some staffing issues and it took a long time to even get a glass of water. The waiter was doing his best - he is professional and I have had him before - but it was clear that there were insufficient staff working. We ordered tapas, which are deliciously prepared and large in portion size. However, when we ordered the hummus, there was too much to be possibly consumed with the pita chips that were provided. We asked for more, and got a somewhat strange response, "well that will be another 50 cents!" Somehow either they need to be free (I mean, come on) or make them a couple of bucks, or raise the price on the dish. Anyway, after a long wait for dinner and dessert and the check we were out in nearly 3 hours. I like romantic dinners, but the babysitter bill was a bit high for the date.

<Content> I love Radio Maria! I used to go here with my parents sometimes when they came to visit me as a student. This weekend my husband and I were in town for a board meeting and had a pleasant dinner. We sat outside because the weather was great.Delicious mojitos for both of us. We had the roasted garlic on toast, a potatoes with chorizo and egg tapas, and the filet mignon entree special with roasted brussels sprouts and pearl onions, radishes, mustard and cheddar. Absolutely to die for!!We will definitely return on another trip to the CU.

<Content> I can't speak for the bar and restaurant itself. We went to a wedding party where the party closed the place for the evening.As a party venue, Radio Maria was really great. I love the old architecture and the period decorations. Yet, they have a modern touch also, so I guess you would call it eclectic. When you walk in, the bar is is front of you. It is large, and I would guess that it is very well attended. (Lots of people tried to get in but were turned away due to the party.) They had one of the largest liquor selections I've seen, and they even have infused liquors. I tried the maple-bacon burbon - good, but a little too sweet for my tastes. Their infused liquors are all made on premises. The bartender told me he did it himself - and for the party, he wore a kilt.The dining room is large. We had a limited menu with four choices and we all pre-ordered our meals. I have to say that the salad served before the dinner was really excellent, fresh, simple and just the right amount of dressing. I can't say as much for the meal - I had smoked ribs. They were pretty tough, but did have a good taste.They also have tables on the sidewalk which we took advantage of. Topping the night off by sitting outside, drinking bourbon, eating dessert, smoking a cigar and watching the people walk by ended the night with a flair.If I make it back to Champaign, Radio Maria is definitely on my go-to list.

<Content> When we first moved here everyone kept recommending Radio Maria and I have no idea why. We went there a few times. The service was fine, the atmosphere was okay. The food was awful. Everything contained way too much garlic. You could smell and taste the garlic in everything. I think it's an okay place to grab drinks and sit outside on a nice evening, but I wouldn't try the tapas everyone raves about.

<Content> Shockingly I came here without checking Yelp, but I was really happy with the meal I shared with a friend. They have two menus, one for traditional dinner and one with tapas items. Since I like trying different things, we decided to share 5 small plates.Patatas (bravas): Great crispy potato chunks with some fancy mayonnaise (aioli) Charcuterie plate: Slightly untraditional plate of four types of meat. Spicy salami-ish meat, serrano ham, duck breast, and bbq crispy pork. The crispy pork was my favorite, but everything was really tasty, especially mixed with the pickled onions. Mussels: Really complex flavorful broth with well cooked and meaty mussels. The toast they came with was top notch, also.Lamb meatballs: Tasty, especially with hidden gems of pine nuts. If you really like meatballs, I definitely recommend these. Garlic shrimp: Four plump and juicy shrimp hanging out on a large piece of toast with a mayo based sauce. I loved these.The decor is slightly art deco, but a little more colorful and whimsical than that. Service was excellent, and I think overall it's a pretty good value for Champaign. I can't think of anything I didn't like at Radio Maria and would strongly recommend it!

<Content> My SO and I made our Valentine's Reservations here, and were extremely happy.The Good:-The goat cheese, the goat cheese, the goat cheese!! We had several tapas and one appetizer, and the fried goat cheese was our favorite, so delicious and creamy, and it is served with a light jam that makes a wonderful combination.-The pork tacos were also delicious, and obviously slow cooked, very delicious.-The service was excellent, especially for how busy everything was (they were tripled booked for Valentine's).-The homemade ricotta gnudi were also delicious, especially with the sauteed mushrooms that accompanied it. -We also ordered a flight of ice cream that featured a mint chocolate cake flavor which was extremely aromatic, and smelled like I was walking through an herb garden, delicious. The Meh:-Personally, I was not a fan of the arancini, to me all I could taste was a fried greasy taste.Overall:-Would definitely return! Especially for date night, it's a fantastic place.

<Content> Radio Maria has the best Cubans in Champaign. The bad news is that you can't get it unless you go during brunch on the weekend. The tapas, however, are pretty good. I generally get the roasted garlic and one of the various meat dishes, though sometimes I add in or replace it with the cheese and jelly plate.Radio Maria can get expensive, and often crowded, but the decor is great and service has generally been strong.

<Content> Why did I wait so long?Finally made it here for dinner and I'm glad I did! The restaurant has an urban / antique feel - exposed brick, high ceiling, and colorful. There were some tables outside, a rather large bar area inside, high tops, large half moon booths, and a separate dining room. Without reservations for a busy Saturday night the wait was not bad at less than 30 minutes. The host and server in charge of the outside patio were enthusiastic and kind striking small talk during the wait which made me excited for my meal! Once seated our actual server seemed distracted or slammed. Between 2 of us we ordered 4 dishes (tapas) and 2 drinks and were full. Goat cheese with pumpkin seeds/spices, eggplant frites, risotto balls, potato/charizo/egg dish = all tasty. The bill came in under $40! From being indifferent prior to dining here I now wish I did sooner. Radio Maria seems to have great drink deals, happy hour, and brunch.

<Content> Brunch might be the best in Champaign-Urbana area. 5-stars. Beer-bread toast is thick and incredible. Omelets are over-stuffed and innovative and completely satisfying. Regular specials make some variation on the menu. Coffee is aromatic and high quality. Wait-staff at Radio rarely makes mistakes: they're natural and easy and very good.As for other things, their beer selection is as good as any of the craft beer bars in downtown Champaign (Blind Pig, Quality, Big Grove, etc) but I often forget about it as a choice.4-stars overall only because the tapas menu, while tasty, can get really pricy for the portion sizes. This is what tapas is about I suppose, but also means I don't choose to head here in the evening as often.

<Content> I went here twice for dinner and once just for drinks.This is the perfect place for a date night- it has a really chill, artsy vibe once.I went here for dinner once and it was very crowded but we were able to eat at the bar. I had a hot pot, which was delicious but my mother ordered something that didn't take as long and her food was cold. They were very nice about it though and reheated her food for her.When I came for drinks, the server was very accompanying when our group wanted to move from inside to outside and had confusing orders.The tapas are delicious- especially the eggplant frites and the goat cheese. You could come here a million times and never order the same item.Next on my list is to come here for brunch because I've heard amazing things.

<Content> Definitely a fan of Radio Maria. It's always a safe bet for a great meal. I always have tapas but they have a full dinner menu as well. I recommend the hanger steak, plantains, and pork tacos. They also have charcuterie and cheese plate type tapas dishes that work very well as starters. The wine and beer selections are also substantially larger than the average restaurant. Anyone visiting Champaign or locals that have never been to Radio Maria should definitely give it a shot.

<Content> What can I say? Having studied abroad in southern Spain for a semester in college, Radio Maria's Spanish flare and tapas menu really pluck at a heartstring with me. I love enjoying late afternoon tapas on a warm summer day with great drinks and better friends. I'm not forgetting the great selection of entrees this restaurant/bar offers, but in typical Spanish fashion, I usually fill up on beer and tapas before I can even contemplate dinner. While they don't serve dinner all night long, they do continue serving their most popular tapas until close. So grab a group of friends and head over to Radio Maria soon; the availability of food at all hours makes it a great place to start or end a night downtown!

<Content> *hearts-in-eyes emoji goes here*I absolutely LOVE Radio Maria. I have only had tapas one time previous to this place, and that was in Barcelona. The atmosphere, decor, and food is downright enchanting. If you want to wow your first date - don't come here. They will fall in love with this restaurant and probably forget all about you. Ok but enough cheesiness, the food is great, even for a vegetarian like myself. I can't get enough of this place. I will say that the service was nothing to rave about - but it wasn't horrible. It also can be difficult to get a reservation/table on many nights - but that's a testament to how great it is.

<Content> I have been to Radio Maria before and had good experiences, but it has been a few years. I took my family there for dinner during graduation weekend since I had just graduated from law school.I understand that graduation weekend in Chambana can be really crazy. However, the service we got was unacceptable. We ate dinner at a different restaurant in downtown Champaign the night earlier and did not have anywhere near the problems we had at Radio Maria. Our water glasses were constantly empty, the waiter would go a half hour or more without stopping by our table, he would forget to do things we requested (i.e. fill our water glasses), etc. The restaurant is also EXTREMELY noisy.Given the prices at the restaurant, we really expected better. Further, although most of our food was pretty good, my grandparents could not eat the hanger steak they ordered to share. My grandparents cannot do spicy food and the steak ended up being totally caked in a pepper crust. The bottom of the menu says items on the menu contain ingredients that are not listed, but that is in very small letters and I didn't even notice it. Apparently, my 90+ year old grandparents didn't notice it either. My boyfriend tried the steak and said it was pretty spicy, so it seems strange that the fact that the meal is spicy isn't on the menu.My grandpa also got meat that was not good quality. It was very tough and he said it was inedible. The restaurant handled the problem graciously, however, and took the steak off the bill which we appreciated.Nevertheless, it is unlikely I would go back to Radio Maria or even recommend it to other people. I will be here for several more months while I study for the bar and even though I always thought of this place as one of the nicer restaurants in town, I was really disappointed. There are restaurants in Chambana that have great food for better prices.

<Content> So here's the scoop - This is a great spot for two reasons: (1) back-lit bar (with bright blue lights), (2) best Bloody Mary ever.I've been here twice now. Once just for drinks and the second time for dinner and drinks. Although I came for dinner the second time, I was so drawn to the bar that I ate dinner with my friends at the bar. You see the back-lit bar once you walk in, and I swear you will walk toward it like it's force is pulling you to it. It's captivating. Like a kid following a chocolate bar being held in front of him... if you're not drawn to the bar, something is wrong with you.I've only had one dinner item on the menu, so I'm no expert, but I can tell you that the menu is stellar. The offerings are really impressive; there is something on the menu for everyone. The food is upscale in terms of components - you can tell just by reading the menu. It's also upscale in taste. I had the veggie green curry. As a self-proclaimed curry master, I have to give it my thumbs up. Delicious.If you're a "drinks over food" type of person. This is your spot. The drink menu is probably 4x as big as the food menu. I would say RM got this ratio just right. They have a crazy good drink menu, and if the blue bar won't keep you coming back, the drink menu will.Last tid bit - the service is great. The waiters and bartenders are really nice and super helpful. No reason not to come here, unless you're afraid you'll never leave (good possibility).

<Content> Our whole family loves Spanish food and since we were all in Champaign for the football game we decided to check out a "new to us" Tapas restaurant.When we arrived at 2:45, the kitchen was not open but would reopen in 15 minutes. We decided we could easily wait so we snagged two tables outside and ordered drinks. The waiter delivered the drinks and took our tapas order so he could put in the order as soon as the kitchen opened which was a marvelous idea! Before you knew it we were sipping on Sangria and our food began to arrive.We tried the cheese plate which was outstanding. I could have just eaten that and been happy. The mussels were grilled which had a pleasant taste but the grilling did dry them out. The biggest disappointment was the Spanish tortilla, the traditional egg and potato omelet of Spain. This had been prepared like more of a quiche and no one at the table liked or ate it. I adored the fantastic lamb meatballs, we even ate the sauce with some of the bread which came with the cheese plate. The other tapa I tried were the marinated olives which were not nearly as good as I had expected. The marinade was so vinegary, not a smooth flavor at all. I would not order that again. We shared everything but there were some dishes I didn't try as I had ordered paella for my entree.The paella was really really good. It had a spicy chorizo but it did not overpower the overall rich saffron/olive oil taste of the dish. The rice part was outstanding and the chicken and seafood were generous and tender. What a treat! I had partaken of too many tapas so my husband had to finish mine, now that is a generous portion.We had a great meal, my sangria mellowed me out after like 4 sips, the Illini had won and the weather was beautiful. When the sizable check arrived I might have blanched at bit under normal circumstances but my husband and I just laughed and put it on a credit card.It was a great meal with the family but very expensive.  Next game, those kids are getting pizza or burgers!  Ol!

<Content> I am not impressed with this place. My friend and I walk into the bar side for tapas. I had read the reviews on yelp before I went, but my friend really wanted to check this place out. My first impression: There are at least 7 empty tables and a totally empty bar. The hostess asks us how many, and are we here for drinks, tapas, or full meal? I tell her tapas, and she tells us it's going to be 5-10 minutes, would we like to have a drink at the bar? Sure, we walk past several empty tables and sit at the empty bar. We are impressed with the blue light coming out from the bar top, when a "bartender" walks past and LITERALLY THROWS a drink menu onto the bar near us. And keeps walking by. I wasn't shocked because I had read the reviews, but I thought that was totally rude.I asked another guy walking by for a glass of water. He was able to ablige, and by the time we got our water, amazingly the empty table behind us was available. We sat, checked out a menu, ordered 3 tapas, and my friend ordered a beer and I ordered a glass of wine. It took quite awhile for just the drinks to get delivered. I was disappointed in the amount that they called a "glass" was about half of a glass I've gotten at other restaurants. And when I was looking at the wine list, I asked for a recommendation, and said I didn't like fruity reds, I preferred more on the dry side. I took a sip of an incredibly fruity red wine. Sigh...When the food arrived, it was alright. Maybe I just expect more. It was okay food, just not as tasty as I've had elsewhere. There were no outstanding flavors, or a bite of food that made me sit back and go "wow." Just ...average.The waitress asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu. Sure, why not. We went with the dark chocolate cake. About 20 minutes later, we finally got the cake. What took so long? Who knows. Maybe they had to bake the cake after we ordered it... Anyway, I have NEVER left a piece of chocolate cake on a plate at a restaurant before. My friend said the cake tasted like deli meat to her. How does one make cake taste like deli meat? I have no idea. It tasted out right burnt to me. Burnt cake peeled out of a pan, with some hersey's syrup on top to cover the taste.I ask for the check. She came by with the check, I gave her my credit card, and away she went. Another 15 minutes passed, and she had walked by our table about 5 times. The next time she walked by, I asked her for the credit card receipt. She was totally suprised, and hadn't realized she had never given it back to us. She was sincere, it was just annoying. I wasn't impressed with the food, and somewhat unhappy with the service. There was dancing (salsa or something) starting as we were leaving, but I wasn't in the mood for it. I don't know if I would recommend this place. Maybe once just to go... but I think once is enough.

<Content> Some restaurants in this area have Chicago-envy. That must be the problem with Radio Maria. The fusion menu doesn't work because the chef has not mastered the basic cuisines that they are trying to blend. Dishes are overly complex and are either bland or actively taste bad. The staff used to describe it as a Caribbean-Polish Fusion. (Really.) I have no idea what's going on now. Spanish-Korean? Soul Food Middle Eastern Style? Masa boats. Frog legs. Ground coffee rubs. Pad Thai. Torta.  The motto seems to be: when in doubt, add more things that don't go together, none of it done well.This could only be mistaken for sophistication by people who have never been anywhere sophisticated. Stay away!

<Content> Brunch!OK, first, we have to discuss the breakfast potatoes. As a daughter of Irish stock, I thought I was pretty much over any potato-creation. Wrong. These were baked to perfection (crispy skin, soft middles) and impeccably seasoned. I ate every last morsel. Seriously, I love when things look so simple (they are just cut-up potatoes!) are so unreasonably delicious.Secondly, just about any option could be made vegetarian. Bonus points for that, Maria!Portions were enormous... but we all cleaned our plates... so yeah, it was all very good (or we are all brunch-piggies, your pick).Our lovely brunch was reasonably priced as well. I treated my two friends (yeah, I'm a high roller) without cringing at the check.

<Content> The Good:-I liked the decor. It was very pretty.-The "Soup of the Day" was Red Pepper-Goat Cheese. I could eat that every single day forever and be very happy.-Extensive beer, wine, and cocktail list.-The boy said that his Curried Shrimp was light and pretty good.The Bad:-The waiter was not friendly. He wasn't mean or bad at his job, but there was no smile. Ever.-The place is separated into two parts, the bar/tapas area and the 'dinner' area. The two sides allegedly do not communicate (?). You can't get anything from the Tapas menu in the dinner side and vice-versa. Our suspicions were confirmed when we heard a waiter telling a customer that no, he couldn't have the "Tapa of the Day," because he didn't even know what it was. ....What the f? Why?!-I had the Korean Hot Pot. I was warned that it was spicy, which it wasn't. It was extremely sweet. So much so, that I had to stop eating by the time I reached the bottom layer of rice. It was like a half cup of brown sugar had been lacquered all over the rice. Blech!The Ugly:-I got food poisoning. Thank you, Korean Hot Pot. My guts are still kvetching about you....The problem is, they had so much delicious-looking stuff on the menu, that, food poisoning aside, I'll still probably go back. If I come out unscathed next time, we'll see about upping the score. Really, a 2 1/2 would've been perfect.

<Content> Falling Fast. I've been going to Radio Maria since it opened and have likely gone for dinner for the last time. The menu, once a delightful mix of cultures and influences, and the sort of place where there was nothing bad on the menu, has been getting progressively smaller and less capable as the years have gone on. Drinks are good, Tapas is "meh" and pricey, dinner...no...and pricey. We went last week and I ordered salmon which arrived with sweet potato chips - and a huge fried egg on top. The fish was okay at best and the odd attempts at nouvelle cuisine were amusing - but tasteless in every sense of the word.In a market as competitive as C-U, I don't see how they can continue this based on anything but location and alcohol. Pity to see an old favorite fall this far.

<Content> I don't even know what I'm supposed to review here. Is it a restaurant? A tapas bar? And what's with this sunday comfort food menu? Do they even know anymore?I almost feel bad giving this jack of all trades only three stars. It's not that there's anything outright bad here: the dining rooms are nicely decorated, the service is okay, the food is well-prepared, the wine and beer selection is thorough but not amazing. You probably won't be disappointed.But then there's nothing about this place that's outright great, either.Radio Maria was the first restaurant downtown, and they did a fabulous job. But now the dinner menu hasn't changed in years, they got rid of a lot of their good lunch menu (in favor of tapas), and they've got this strange "upscale comfort food" menu on Sundays that doesn't seem to fit in very well.Even the service - which used to be their highest point - has been slipping. As the old guard moves on, they're being replaced with awkward servers who don't know (and don't seem to care) about the food and drinks they're serving.I will, inevitably, go back. But since I can go just a few doors down, spend a few more dollars and get an exceptional meal, why wouldn't I?

<Content> Every time the convo about restaurants in Champaign starts, the mom-in-law mentions Radio Maria. Her praise hits often and reaches far. Tonight, we finally had dinner at the infamous Champaign culinary sensation.The food offering was a mish-mash of cuisines - South American, Asian, Mediterranean, Spanish - and seemed to lack a consistent and unifying theme/thread/philosophy. These types of menus are generally red flags for me because they say: I can do a breadth of styles good, but not one style great.We started off sharing the mezze plate. Pita was pizza dough-y, but buttery too...strange, in my opinion. Also, I found the couscous bland. Best part was the hummus, which I was wishing they served more of.For dinner I ordered the crabcakes, which were more like crabballs. Goat cheese potato pancakes were crisp, but lacked seasoning. Radio Maria's Haitian slaw was flavorless and served merely as decoration on my plate - I hate to say it, but KFC's got better slaw! Positives about the crabballs - they weren't THAT bad and you get three in an order. If you order this, ask for extra garlic aioli (probably best to ask for it on the side). I probably would've enjoyed my balls (but, really...who doesn't?!) more if I had extra aioli.Beau ordered the adobo pork. Generous hunk of pig, the orange-bourbon BBQ sauce starts sweet on the tongue, then finishes with a kick...flavor was decent, but I wasn't expecting or enjoying this sweet sweet meat (SHOCK, I know!). Jalapeno-cheddar cornbread was interesting in concept, but lacking in execution...I would've never known there was jalapeno unless the menu told me! Like the roughage on my plate, the honey left his chayote-cilantro salad be.Call me crazy, but I AM willing to try their brunch and/or tapas, but lemme check-in with not-my-bio-mama first...

<Content> Radio Maria is definitely one of the nicest dining options in downtown Champaign. I remember going almost two years ago when I first visited Champaign, and really enjoying it. I've gone again a couple times after moving here, and I was never disappointed.The restaurant is divided into two different dining rooms: one that serves more traditional entrees, and another (the larger one, where the bar is located) that serves predominantly tapas. I don't really understand why they can't serve both types of food in both rooms seems it looks like they share the same kitchen, but that's a detail. I would recommend going for the tapas (the other room is a little more *stuffy*). I've now tried a bunch of dishes, and everything has been good if not very good. A few highlights among the tapas that I tried: the spicy shrimp in chile-lime sauce are delicious, as are the anchovies (if you like anchovies, that is), and the scallops. They also usually have a bunch specials, which I would recommend trying. Not to forget, they have an extensive wine list (including a pretty good selection of wine by the glass), and a full bar. The drinks are particularly cheap (at least compared to NYC prices that I am used to), and I'm always amazed at how low the bill is in the end: you can have a really nice meal with alcohol for $40 to $50, which is a pretty good deal considering the quality of the food. The service has also always been good. 4-1/2 stars.

<Content> I have always enjoyed myself here. I've dined and drank and drank and drank.A few highlights of Radio are: 1) their Absinthe service, which is quite a production. I don't feel like I can really do it justice by describing it, but you will not be disappointed if you order up a couple Absinthe drinks. 2) They offer "The Wheel", which is a 3.5 oz shot of each of their beers on tap. They have about 28 beers on tap, and many are the darker craft ales, which in addition to being really tasty, are higher in proof. You need a couple of people to do this right, and there are some "rules", but if you are already planning on cabbing it home, this is a great way to learn about beer and get drunked. 3) Their kitchen stays open all night. 'nuff said. 4) Radio is one of the very best places to sit outside on a nice summer night. Get a table at dusk, put your back to the window and watch the night unfold.

<Content> A great salsa dancing club in the evening hours! I've never been here for lunch, but the atmosphere is great in the evening. $5 to get in and then salsa dancing all night! There's a full bar if you get thirsty and two dance floors. Salsa music is played and danced to--a welcome alternative to college kids bumping and grinding while sloshing cheap beer over the rims of cans. Even if you don't know how to salsa come on by; you might meet someone who will teach you!I will certainly try out lunch here at some point. In the meantime, check it out on a Friday or a Saturday night!

<Content> Once upon a time this place was good... but I can't say that's true any longer. I believe that the tapas area is a good bar.. but not so much a good restaurant. Go to Cafe Luna for better and cheaper food. I used to enjoy the other restaurant. They still have good free chips and salsa (that you eat while you wait for your food). The actual stuff on the menu is not so good. Also.. they haven't changed the menu in the last half year. Everything on it right now seems Spanish inspired.. and some of the things aren't so inspiring to eat.UPDATE: I went here for drinks the other night. I am not a big fan of their table set up even though the bar was pretty cool. I think they must not have very good bartender's working here on the weekend. It took like five minutes for them to figure out how to make a rum and diet Coke. And it didn't even taste right! It was like vanilla rum or vanilla Coke. But to their credit, I heard they have good mojitos.

<Content> Radio Maria makes me feel good. There, I said it. Any restaurant has its flaws, but RM is about as close as it comes to perfect in Chambana. RM is situated in the bustling Downtown, and sports an eclectic modern decor with latin touches. The Tapas Lounge is all-modern, with changing exhibitions for wall-art, and a Euro-chic cleanliness, not typically found in the mid-west. I will talk of the awesome Tapas 'experience' at a later date, but this blog is devoted to our last night in The Dining Room.With an exceptional wine-list, dinner at RM always begins and ends well in terms of drinking options. One of the best things for me is that no matter what mood I am in financially, (from big-night-out, to my typical tuesday-night-budget) there are so many choices of great tasting vino. Although RM changes its menu about once a year, they (thankfully) keep many of their favorites available, such as the Coffee Filet, Peppercorn Tuna steak, New York Strip and appetizers Seared Avocado with Quinoa salad and Grilled Goats Cheese Medallions in pesto. All dishes have latin-fusion inspired flavors, plenty of warm chile, spicy cream, mole and guacamole sauces.Service at RM is impeccable. Quick, but tastefully so, timing is almost always perfect, polite and sophisticated. Their knowledgeable sommelier staff are very helpful for beginners and experienced wine-drinkers alike. Dinner is not cheap for the average mid-west dining clientele, but compared to similar dining rooms in larger cities, I think Radio Maria is worth double whatever the bill is.ALWAYS order the special, their young, fashionable chefs always deliver. Expect to spend $60-$80 on food for 3 courses for 2 people in the restaurant, or $40-$60 in the tapas lounge.

<Content> Good food from a wide selection of ethnicities - cajun, indian, latin american, but not fusion. Just all on the same menu. Kind of hard to explain. They have just about everything - seafood, duck, lamb, plus the standards. They try to be inventive but usually are not too adventurous - still, the meal satisfies. I think they could let their hair down a little more by putting some riskier things on the menu. Good selection of wines and beers, plus margarias and sangria.

<Content> I'm starting to think these guys spread themselves a bit too thin.At brunch yesterday we were overwhelmed by how many options there were, with 14 regular offerings or so, about eight different omelettes, and then a dozen specials. Yikes! Unfortunately, most of us were underwhelmed with the food. My wife's Italian omelette lacked a kick--add some fresh garlic, perhaps? The two of us whose dishes included the "house made" chorizo were disappointed at the sausage's lack of flavor--either spice it up or use store-bought, folks!The mediocre food was made up for by the wonderful decor and overall experience. As a Chicagoan with family in Champaign I'm jealous that a place like this exists, so inexpensive, with so much variety on the menu and 37 beers on tap (next door at the Tapas Bar)! If they spent some time tweaking the dishes they have and adding that extra something many of them miss, they could become a truly top-notch restaurant for brunch.UPDATE: Went to the tapas-bar portion of RM the other night and was really pleased with the dishes. A few traditional tapas but mostly inventive twists using spanish ingredients, like lightly battered asparagus with serrano ham and manchego cheese and seared avocado stuffed with quinoa. Really tasty stuff, and goes great with one of the 25 draft beers (most of which cost four bucks).

<Content> Great tapas bar, great drinks, great ambiance, great service, just great overall. You can come here anytime at all and find something that suits your palette. An upscale restaurant in downtown Champaign, Radio Maria has both a well developed tapas bar with a metro, modern dcor as well as your classic restaurant dining area which is decorated in such a way that gives it a more rustic feel.My first experience here was a very pleasant one as we were promptly seated, the waitress was very attentive, and the food was done very well. We started off with the broiled goat cheese as an appetizer which was very tasty, and then I got the grilled salmon as an entre. Like everything else in Radio Maria, it was cooked well, plated beautifully, and served relatively promptly.I came here again several weeks later for brunch with some friends and had a craving for some spicy sausage so I got the house-made chorizo omelet. To sum it all up: *drooool*. My friend's said the same thing about their orders (Greek, Italian, and Pinta's omelet, and the egg sandwich). Everything tasted fresh and light - just like breakfast should.Whether you're looking for a place to loosen your tie and grab a drink after work, out on a romantic date, or just hanging out with friends, Radio Maria is a sure bet for good food and a good time.

<Content> Nice upscale-casual place in the heart of downtown Champaign. Their menu varies, but just tonight I tried a couple of tapas (fried mozzarella and calamari) and the mushroom ravioli. All were delicious and well presented.My warm chocolate cake dessert, however, tasted soggy and generally unpleasant. It came with a scoop of some oddly flavored ice cream---I think it was meant to be mint, but it tasted more like horseradish. Not the best way to end a dinner; fortunately the rest of the meal was good enough to make up for it.Our server tonight did a thoroughly wonderful job. But overall service in the restaurant felt slightly slow, even on this quiet Monday night when my party was one of only two or three in the entire restaurant for a whole two hours. Halfway through our meal I noticed a middle-aged woman abruptly exit the restaurant despite pleas from her waiter. There was no commotion: it appeared the customer left, after settling down but before ordering, simply to protest the service speed.If I had to nitpick, I'd add that the men's restroom was a little worn and unkempt in the details for a restaurant of this caliber. The lock was also broken. Holistically, though, I had a great dining experience here.Quick tip to first-time diners: Free parking is kitty-corner to the restaurant in a third-party lot. Spaces numbered 1 through 30 are reserved for this restaurant's patrons.

<Content> If you want good cocktails that are overpriced this is your place! Seriously, they had some interesting concoctions on the menu and I tried two of them. They were both fine. Very heavy on mixer. I am one of those weirdos who actually likes to taste the alcohol, the ratio was a bit off. The food is decent as well. I feel as though there have been some odd thing going on with honey on their menu right now, though. Fried eggplant with balsamic vinegar and honey... what? Why? My friend loved it. I tried it. Yuck! Waaaay too sweet. Lots of dishes with honey when i was there last.They clearly know a thing or two about food in the way they pair ingredients most of the time but sometimes it's a miss. To some degree, I appreciate that their menu changes based on what is available, however, I don't appreciate it when I look on the menu and there is only one thing I would consider eating.

<Content> I am giving this restaurant 0 stars. I don't want anyone else wasting their money at this establishment. Here goes:My fellow students and I had organized a fundraiser to be held at R.M. We were raffling off some of our artwork and had ordered a substantial amount of food because we were expecting 50+ guests. Around 8:30pm, there was an AWFUL stench that filled the bar area, followed by a watery mist that began to fall from the ceiling along the west wall of tables. There were a number of people sitting in this area (myself included), who were covered in this putrid water (I had to go home and shower!!!). The food we ordered which was on a nearby table, was also covered. I alerted the manager who said to me "It must be our pipes again." Again? This has happened to other customers? The manager then called the fire department in to inspect the pipes running along the ceiling, while our guests (those who were left) crowded awkwardly around the bar. The manager took no action in remedying the situation. Our food was NOT replaced, and the water on the tables and chairs was NOT wiped up, so that the guests could resume sitting. The artwork that was hanging on the wall was also damaged by the water, and was NOT compensated for. Radio Maria had quoted us for the cost of food prior to the event, but when we received our bill, it was over twice what they had quoted. Worse yet, the manager only refunded us the cost of one cheese plate. Thanks. You're swell. This matter is still not resolved as the owners of Radio Maria seem to think they owe us nothing. I disagree, and until we receive just compensation, I will not be returning and hope you don't either.

C-U does a good job of disproving this (and at times, an amazingly disgusting job of proving it correct) but Radio Maria is my number one choice.Their brunch menu features typical brunch/breakfast items; omelettes (lots of options for fillings), other egg creations, sandwiches, etc. My mom is a big fan of their crab cakes, and I believe my dad always gets a sandwich of some kind. I always get an omelette, which I always enjoy. Everything (nearly) comes served with their "beer bread" which seems to be some kind of beer/corn bread thing that's fantastic. They sell it separately in loaves, last time we were there my parents bought one to take home.The service can be a bit iffy, last time we went our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us as people who were seated later got their food way before we did. But eventually our food came, and he was very apologetic. I don't think this is indicative of their service typically, but from what others have said it may be. Overall though, Radio Maria is not to be missed.

<Content> Please, Radio Maria owners, read these reviews and take corrective action! Do not rest on your laurels because that way failure lies...I don't get to go to Radio Maria as often as I used to. It has a fond place in my heart, which is probably good for them as I'm not dinging them as much as I could in this review. RM was one of the first hip businesses that launched the downtown revival (along with The Blind Pig, v 1.0) and for that I have much love.The last few times we've gone, we've sat outside and had tapas. Now I'm no tapas expert, but I believe you usually order a bunch of tapas and they come out one-at-a-time to your table so you can experience each dish on its own merits. RM, however, always sends out all the tapas all at the same time. Everything becomes a mish-mash and it's overwhelming and nothing stands out. You also immediately get abandoned by the waitstaff so you have to wait forever to order another drink or get/pay your check. Also, the pretty pretty people who work there don't like kids. That would be fair if we were dragging the kids inside and interrupting the restaurant. But even if your kids are well-behaved and you're sitting outside, you catch a real snotty attitude. I am happy to report, however, that they do have a real highchair. When my eldest was a baby they had a beautiful vintage deathtrap highchair. They now have one that is still aesthetically pleasing, but without all the metal.The restaurant itself is still lovely. I just wish they'd shape up their staff so it wasn't so depressing to interact with them.

<Content> I dearly loved this place when I lived in C-U. Never had a bad meal, although sometimes it was marred with indifferent service of the "I am a hipster working in the hippest restaurant in town! What, you want me to DO WORK?" type. Brunch was awesome; a lot cheaper than dinner so my impoverished self could get a fix when mom and dad weren't paying. The beer bread, yes, and the masa boat, yes! And at the time they opened, renovating a decrepit downtown location to expose the brick walls and original tin ceilings was a new idea. They kickstarted a great trend. Downtown Champaign wouldn't be what it is today without Radio Maria. I remember going to that space to pick out wallpaper with my mom and dad back in the 80's. Radio Maria is a vast improvement.

<Content> Two words. Grilled plaintains. HO MY GOD.No, but really, the couple times I've been here have been good. Normally, I've only come for drinks but today was the second time I've come for food. The tapas are a little on the expensive side (they are tapas after all I guess) but I think they're very tasty. In a perfect world, I'd like to have maybe 4 arancini for 5 bucks, but it is what it is. Unless you're ballin' out of control, you're not going to eat here everyday. Living on grad assistant paychecks, it's a nice treat to come here.I really can't speak to any of the problems that folks have had with service, etc. My group today came in and the servers set up a nice big table for us. They also brought out some carafes for water which is something restaurants tend not to do.Anyway, 4 stars. Take your date here. He/she will thank you.

<Content> i'm from los angeles, the land of many-a-radio maria - so really, i like radio maria because it feels like a slice of home. i've been three times so far, and frankly i have to say that nothing has blown me away, but everything i've had has been pretty damn solid.first time i came for lunch, and had a portobella/goatcheese/pesto sandwich thing, and it was delicious. not very unique but good eats. i came for dinner the same night and enjoyed the pan seared peppercorn crusted tuna which again was not a unique dish by any means but solidly executed. i recently went back for the tapas - their piquillos rellenos were flavorful and the portobello entree was perfect. what i admire about the food here is that they aren't scared of flavor, which is something ive noticed happening in fusion-type restaurants. ALSO, their drinks are marvelous. pricey but innovative!

<Content> Came here one evening for tapas with friends. I was the only one that ordered for the four of us and our waiter just starred at us for awhile asking if we were sure that's all we wanted. You could tell he hadn't been working there long as he had to ask the kitchen twice about what was in some of the different sauces and I had to repeat my order twice so that he could remember it. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Crostini, Smoked Pork Tacos and Sauteed Calamari. My favorite was the Wild Mushroom Crostini. The mixture of the cheese, fried egg and mushrooms with the crunch of the bread made it delicious. The Sauteed Calamari was an interesting dish with a lot of flavor. It came out in a soup dish so it was great to dip just some of the bread in the sauce. The Pork Tacos were my least favorite as there was too much green onion for my liking.The food was good but each dish was made for two people rather than four. As we were finishing our plates, a waitress cleaned our table without asking if we were done, which peeved me because I wasn't done with the calamari.

<Content> I loved the decor in the new Radio Maria Tapas bar, but I was NOT crazy about the tapas. The olives in our manchego baked olive dish had a bizarre citrus note that was rather offputting, and were way short on manchego. Our apple blue cheese spread appeared to be apple-free, and the blue cheese spread itself was runny. My bloody mary was top notch; I'll have to do some serious research to figure out whether it surpasses guido's for best bloody mary down town.

<Content> I went here for Valentine's Day and was slightly disappointed. While the soft lighting and tiled ceiling lends a lovely ambiance, the food and service did not stand up. It was a very busy night, but our waitress was obviously assigned to too many tables. It too a long time for her to take our order and she forgot to bring the basket of chips initially. We were also seated by the window and the heating was poor. I was lucky I was wearing a warm dress, because I saw people near us having to wear their jackets while dining. I enjoyed my appetizer of figs with honey and gouda and the chips had a tasty aioli dip, but the main courses were less impressive. I had the Torta Maria, which sounded fascinating, but it ended up being a heap of flavors that really didn't stand out. My date's chicken breast was teeny tiny and he did not enjoy the accompanying slaw. The dessert menu was a bit boring, but the pot de creme was good. I also tried the tapas bar recently, which was a slightly better experience. The salmon skewers with cucumber were perfectly spiced and delectable. The balsamic fruit with manchego on bread was good as well. However, the lamb skewers...they were like meatloaf on a stick. The tapas are a good way to try several dishes, but they are overpriced considering how little you get and that I could probably grill salmon and put it on a stick myself. The exception would have been if the little dishes displayed exceptional artistry, such as Cafe Luna's.

<Content> Great food, not overly pricey, and thoroughly enjoyable. Their menu is unusually limited for a place of this nature, but they rotate items frequently, ensuring that Radio Maria is a place you can come to more than once a month.The best part about Radio Maria is at night; not content with being just a cultured restaurant, it become a bar/latin dance night. For this, it gets at least one more star to land at 4.

<Content> This is one of those restaurants that makes me wish I lived in Champaign/Urbana again. Even though it's been open for years, I didn't go until recently. We went for a brunch, and the food was amazing!My wife had the french toast and something eggy. Probably an omelet. The french toast was fabulous. I don't know what kind of bread they use, but it's perfect. She was able to taste some of the egg used, but I just tasted lovely golden syrup and cinnamon.The cuban was served on a fresh baguette. The meat was terrific, and so was the bread. The american fries ( I think) that we each got with the meal were perfectly cooked and seasoned.The decor is very cool, nice artwork hangs on the walls, and because it's downtown, it's close to Cowboy Monkey, The Art Theatre, and The Virginia theatre. VERY highly recommended!

<Content> On a recent trip to Chambana my family stopped here to celebrate my sister's graduation from UIUC and were quite pleased. To start, the wine list was decent with selections from the west coast to Burgundy and Bordeaux, though they were slightly more marked up that I've been used to in Chicago. However, the kitchen was very clearly overextended on the graduation Saturday. While I don't fault them for that I must comment that it didn't seem like they had tried to shove extra tables into the restaurant so it shouldn't have taken 3 hours for dinner, especially since we ordered quite quickly after we were seated.As for the food, we started with the arancini and garlic shrimp skewers. The arancini was satisfying though plain, and the shrimp skewers were well done. The entrees were bold options that suffered only slightly from less than perfect execution and definitely warrant a return trip. I enjoyed the pan roasted duck with goat cheese polenta and roasted beets, while my family selected their daily special (a salmon dish) or the hangar steak topped with bacon and a fried egg. As I mentioned, the entrees were good enough to warrant a return trip. Hopefully on my next trip to Chambana the kitchen will be less burdened and I'll be able to enjoy my meal at a slightly less leisurely pace.

<Content> Had brunch on Saturday, and it was so good we had to come back for more on Sunday. I had the vegetarian masa boat on Saturday, and it was absolutely delicious. The eggs were a wonderful texture, and it comes with a really great helping of goat cheese - always a plus IMO. Also had to order a side of beer bread and fried plantains, both good. The mexican coffee had a really nice flavor - I would recommend it over their regular coffee.I had the omelet special on Sunday - blue crab, corn, celery, red pepper, with hollandaise on top. Amazing flavors, really great crab. Ordered a side of corn bread (drizzled with honey and orange marmalade), and that was pretty nice as well. Had a guava mimosa - not as much guava flavor as I had hoped, but can't argue too much with a nice helping of champagne!I want to come back soon, especially because we saw these beakers mounted to the wall in the bar area, and our waiter told us it was their own strawberry rum.

<Content> Delicious food, lovely atmosphere. One of my top 5 restaurants in Champaign-Urbana!The roast chicken, fish tacos, and coffee filet are some of my favorite entre's that I've enjoyed here. The food is good quality, and the flavor always delicious!Tapas menu: the frog's legs (mmm, honey) and roasted asparagus are some of my favorites. A few of the tapas items lack flavor; but in general you won't be disappointed.The desserts I've had are lovely; with good flavor and pretty presentation. The portions of everything are very good - not too much food, but plenty to satisfy you.The wait staff has always been nice and helpful, if a bit distracted sometimes. Friendly people, good service.It's definitely one of my favorite restaurants, I go whenever I get the chance, and recommend it to anyone!Note: Many people have reviewed Radio Maria negatively. I think they need to put it in context of local restaurants. We're in Champaign-Urbana, not New York or Seattle. While we should have high standards, we just don't have the variety (and therefore competition) to create a large foody restaurant culture. I also think they need to stop being so negative. I've had a lovely meal and experience every time I've been to RM; I believe you get out of a place what you put into it (as long as it's moderately good, and this is much better than that). Viva Radio Maria! :)

<Content> We came here and had the sauted mushrooms, stewed oxtail, lamb meatballs, steamed mussels, sauted calamari, patatas, roasted tomato and shrimp crostini, and crispy bone marrow. The mushrooms were bland -- the broth needs to be more flavorful. The bone marrow was also disappointing, the sauces on the plate did not complement the bone marrow at all. The crostini was very average, too much bread and oversized tomatoes for the amount of shrimp rendered.On the other hand, the stewed oxtail was absolutely delicious -- the meat was tender and the broth full of umami flavor. I was also a big fan of the lamb meatballs, perfectly done with a creative sauce to match. The potatoes were well seasoned and the dressing paired nicely. The mussels were served in generous proportion.Overall, 50/50 good bad. This was my second visit and I definitely trust Radio Maria for a night out dining.

<Content> Had the chance to visit this restaurant on a Sunday night. Despite having seated most of the tables in the bar side of the restaurant, they seemed to have only one person actively waiting the tables. It took 10-15 minutes to get our drinks...not cocktails, but diet coke and iced tea. The waitress was friendly enough when she showed up to the table, but seemed relatively uninterested in doing so.We ordered several items from the tapas menu (no entrees) and other tables that were seated after us received their food before we did. I agree with the reviewer below that says that tapas should be brought out as they are prepared, not all at once. But sure enough, 45 minutes later all our food arrives at once.The food itself was all very good to excellent, but in hindsight it's the too cool for school attitude of the waitstaff that stands out in my mind, not the food. That's a shame.

<Content> AGHHHH This place is GREAT! I'm not as big of a fan on their Sunday brunch though, but everything is great, especially their TAPAS!!!Last time I went there, I re-orgasmed over and over again. You have to try their steak tips tapas dish. Hopefully it's still there. As the steak tips met my lips, my heart began to sing, and fairies and sparkles started falling out of the sky in a beautiful, sexy, and delicious array of love. It was so good, I wanted to regurgitate each bite, just so that I could taste the deliciousness once again. It also had smoked bacon and feta mixed in, which made me want to take off my clothes and dream of simpler times. PLEASSEEE, please go here, and try to stick with tapas, their regular food is good, but their tapas are ahhmazing!!! only downfall though? Pretty expensive-i think we might've blown about $100 on tapas and there were only three of us.Anyway, please go here and indulge on what may be a gateway to a magical land of rainbows and smiles, and angels singing to you as wish that the chef could accompany you along the path of life.

The bartender was really knowledgeable and there was a great selection of beer, wine and spirits. The menu runs from an inventive tapas list to unique entrees. We were blown away by both the house smoked pork tacos and the duck breast salad. Between the wonderful bar and the outstanding food, we will be stopping back next time we are able to come through Champaign!

The beer bread and potatoes that come with the omelet were so good! We also tried the mexican coffee. It doesn't taste that good with the food. It tastes better on its own. It's something you won't regret trying. It's sweet and has a strong cinnamon flavor. Service was pretty slow, but we were okay with that this time. I highly recommend going to Radio Maria for brunch! I would love to try their lunch and dinner menu as well :)

I am from Danville/Champaign area, and I drove by this place all the time in the daylight, and I never even noticed it. It's definitely for "friends" after hours.I remember I had the Arancini....holy crap was it DELICIOUS!!! The vibe was chill and trendy. A bit upscale for my liking...but eh, to each his/her own. I personally believe the restaurant needs to do more food advertisement, because I think the only thing that either my friends, acquaintances, or myself believe the reason that this place gets any business is because their bar service on the patio after dark.

<Content> Wow. What a great restaurant. I went here with my spouse for a nice date on a Saturday night. It wasn't too packed, surprisingly. They had outdoor and indoor seating, and the atmosphere was exceptional - really nice decorations, perfect lighting, both laid back and classy in its artistic feel.  We decided to order drinks and tapas. They have an excellent selection of beer and wine, by the glass and bottle, both affordable and more pricey, depending on what you want. I had a delicious local craft beer, and my spouse enjoyed some really nice white wine. We are both vegetarians and found that there were many delicious tapas options for us, including fried goat cheese, patatas bravas, fried artichoke hearts, and small gnocchis. Everything tasted wonderful and the presentation was nice as well. Finally, the service was really good. Our waitress, despite having several tables both indoors and outdoors, was attentive without being weirdly hovery, gave us good recommendations, and was really friendly.Overall, an excellent experience, and a great environment for a date.

<Content> Went for brunch and would definitely recommend it. My boyfriend and i tried the masa boat surprise, smoked pork pozole, and 2 mexican coffees. The mexican coffee was delicious, like a spiced coffee with nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. My boyfriend said it had a little too much spice for him, but it reminded me of a spiced latte. The masa boat surprise was tasty, although I recommend getting a little bit of everything in each bite. Eating just the egg and chorizo can be a little bland, but eating it with the veggies, cheese, salsa, black beans and some of the corn "boat" is sooo good. The smoked pork pozole was really good, although it could have been a dinner item if not for the poached eggs. It was kind of like a mexican stew with a couple poached eggs, and some beer bread. The beer bread was very tasty. We'll definitely be going back and try some other things. Radio Maria's has a pretty extensive breakfast and lunch menu.

<Content> I came here for tapas after reading the reviews on yelp. I love to eat tapas in my hometown and was a little skeptical whether or not this place could live up to my LA expectations. Radio Maria did not disappoint!First off, I loved the atmosphere. The architecture and style of the place is so artistic and unique. It's beautiful. I love the artwork all over the walls and the bar area especially. The dim lighting and the small bites menu definitely makes it a great place to go out with friends or to go on a date. The drinks are reasonably priced and tasty too.I had the lamb meatballs, the bread with fig jam, and the bread with serrano pork and orange marmalade and the potatoes. I'm forgetting the name of each dish but they are on the tapas menu. Everything I ordered was great, but the potatoes were AMAZING! They were crispy and had a delicious flavor because they were hickory smoked. They also came with a delicate drizzle of the most delicious sauce, I wish I knew the ingredients so I could re-create this dish. I can't wait to come back to have them again!

<Content> I think the trick to enjoying Radio Maria is not going there for dinner. The brunch is great. I like their omelets, especially the smoked trout one, I like the potato and beer bread that comes on the side. The omelets are enormous and I think the Radio Maria approach (tons and tons of ingredients) works in that context. They'll make you a Bloody Mary with horseradish which I love. The dinners are another story. I've probably eaten here five or six times in the last few years, and I don't get a lot out of anything on their dinner or the tapas menus. Maybe I consistently order the wrong things, but the food is either over- or undercooked or weirdly chewy or bland or greasy. I have friends who rave about the eggplant frites but they are just a greasy mess to me. The wine is usually fine but most of the cocktails are silly, like sorority-girl/moms'-night-out drinks. There was one thing they had years ago that I loved -- grilled asparagus with a fried egg and a drizzle of balsamic. It was simple and delicious. If they still had that I wouldn't dread meeting people here for dinner.

<Content> I enjoyed the atmosphere and the selection on the menu, as it offers food you cant really find anywhere else in the C-U. I thought the menu items were decently priced, maybe a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality of the food. I ordered three tapas dishes - the grilled plantains, the goat cheese, and the beef tacos. The goat cheese was fried and served with honey and bread and it was absolutely delicious! The plantains were pretty plain, but still a nice change of pace from what I normally eat day to day. The beef tacos were tasty, but they were incredibly hard to eat when served in dry corn shelled tortillas. They cracked and fell apart so it was a bit frustrating to end up having to eat a taco with a fork. Our service was absolutely terrible, I had to flag down the host at one point to get my water glass refilled, and she brought out all of our food at different times which was a bit strange. Overall, I was happy with the food I ordered and how it was prepared and how it tasted - were talking about Champaign, Illinois, not Chicago or New York - and unhappy with the service. I wouldn't tell someone not to go there, because it is a unique restaurant for this area, but I would be warned that the service will likely be disappointing.

<Content> I went with a friend and sat outside. It was a beautiful night and our server was very personable and helpful. She helped us order some things that she thought we would like based on savory and sweet and she didn't mind repeating specials and such for us.We got three tapas and an entree and it was all great.A bunch of people told us to try the plantains. They were our least favorite. They weren't bad... just plain.We also got the fried goat cheese, which was served with a honey sauce and bread, and arancini, mozzarella-stuffed risotto. They were both excellent. We had their gnocchi special which was absolutely delicious. It was definitely worth the trip.It is definitely a more casual place. The servers weren't around every minute, but I really didn't mind. It is pricier, but worth the money. I think that it is a great place to relax and spend some time with some great food.

<Content> Great place for tapas in Champaign. I agree that it's a good 'date night' place. Coming from Chicago, I find the portions of tapas to be large and inexpensive- which is great! They also have regular entrees if small plates aren't your thing. They had a good wine list, and the sangria was different ( I think there is brandy in it?) but good nonetheless. This is also a great vegetarian spot.

<Content> I've never had tapas before so there's might not be too much credibility in my review but the food was okay. portions were small and very expense. We ordered a paella ($20) but it came out to be the size of a small tapas so that was kind of disappointing. The servers were super friendly and hipster so definitely fun people to talk to. The wine was really good and the environment was top notch. However, I don't think i will be coming back but it was definitely something I wanted to experience at least once living in Champaign.

<Content> First time here...and I've heard great things about this place. First impressions were pretty good....the ambiance was good and the restaurant had a good amount of people. We started off ordering a tapas as our appetizer...the apple salad. It was very disappointing. The apples were not cut to order and were not crisp even though it was stored in a container of lemon juice. The bacon was not reheated...I mean who likes cold bacon? For pur entrees we ordered the scallops and duck meatloaf. The scallops were good however I personally didnt appreciate the jam that went with it...could have done with a spicy savory sauce. The duck was unknowingly served with the same exact jam. It was a tad too sweet for our tastes, but regardless of that...the meatloaf was absolutely amazing. The egg that topped it however was a bit overcooked so the sunnyside up yolk could not be used as a sauce. Our final conclusion is that the main part of the entreeswere cooked to order, as they should be, but all the garnish was precooked and we got the feeling that it was just thrown on...not worth the price.

<Content> My wife and I returned to Radio after not having been for several years. The service was fantastic and the wine list was excellent. For the most part, the food was good, but there were a couple clunkers. We ordered the a number of tapas, including arancini, pork belly arepa, diver scallops, crab tart, pork tacos, and beignets. The arancini were nicely done, if slightly overpowered by the breading. The pork belly arepa, however, was not made with pork belly and the diver scallops were not diver scallops. I believe the arepa was made with pork shoulder, and was good, but no one ever said anything about the change. Similarly, the scallops were very well done, but were not diver scallops. The crab tart, on the other hand, was a clunker, as were the beignets. The tart was made of corn bread and I don't know that I've ever had a more dried out piece of corn bread in my life. It totally overshadowed the crab. The beignets were huge, which meant they weren't cooked through. They were like eating a heavy cake doughnut, not the light crunchy wonder they should be. The best dish of the night was the tacos. Smoky, spicy, delicious. We will probably go back, but will be much more careful in selecting our dishes.

<Content> Just felt like adding the fact that I have traveld extensively through all of southern Spain and am very familiar with tapas. The food at this place does not remotely resemble anything I have had in Spain or any other good tapas restaurants in the US (New York, DC, SF, etc.). Everything lacks in flavor and freshness. Bottom line, hate it.

<Content> Radio Maria is at the top of the restaurant heap in Chambana for dinner. Top 5 at least. Haven't been for lunch and I haven't experienced the tapas yet. I LOVE the atmosphere because it is understated and eclectic at the same time. I love it when a restarant has the confidence to quietly state its intent rather than screaming "look at my personality!!!!!!!" The radio hostess stand is lovely. And I'm a sucker for their Crass-esque vintage graphic design.Excellent wine selection. The Reisling and Gewuiztraminer are my favorites.The service has always been friendly without being intrusive.My food has always been cooked perfectly.I can't say I agree with the claims that the menu is uninspired. The coffee crusted filet with espresso drizzle and savory vanilla sauce is not exactly something you can get anywhere. I think there is a fine line in a place like Champaign between daring and scary. You can tell by the popularity of places like Olive Garden in this town does not have the most adventurous pallate. Fennel, Saffron, hearts of palm, plantain, poblano chilis, mole... these ingredients are all "hot" in celebrity cuisine scene and at the same time pallatable items for most people. It might not be truffles and quail eggs, but it is modern and accessible. Oh yeah, and delicious.

<Content> The first time my husband and I came to check out Champaign before moving here, we stopped into Radio Maria's for brunch, it was GREAT! Our server who I wish I remembered his name was fantastic! Now that we live here we decided to go out for a really nice dinner, and thought this place would be a great choice. I am sorry to say I was a bit disappointed, in the food and the service. I love the atmosphere there, however that can only entertain you so long, our food took at least and hour before it came out. We did have the baked brie for and appetizer which came out straight away, but then we waited, and waited, and waited for our main entree. Finally I think our server who at this point I was sure had vanished, came to our table and explained the delay. That was 45 minutes later mind you. If he had told us initially that our meals would be slower coming out I would have been more understanding, however when you are starving and you see people who sat after you being served and getting their bill and you don't see your server anywhere, you start to wonder what's up.I would likely go back for the brunch, but may try dinner somewhere else, hence the 3 stars.

The chips were thick, crispy on the outside, but preserving the soft tender pita texture on the inside, complimenting the exceptionally smooth hummus.

<Content> David S. and I were here for brunch today, and it was pretty sweet! They had a variety of options, and a full bar and a commendable wine list. We started with bloody marys though I was tempted to try the bloody maria. My goat cheese, trout and avocado omelet was fresh and delicious and David seemed happy with his tuna, so we made one happy brunching family! Though, can I just say, his tuna was his hunk of meat that looked like a rarely done steak, it was massive. Our waitress was very nice and checked in on us very frequently. All in all, a great brunch experience, I would definitely come back here!

<Content> I'd love to say Radio Maria is my favorite restaurant and give it 5 stars. After all, they have awesome sangria and great sunday brunch. The fig appetizers on their dinner menu are fantastic, but their dinner entres are hit or miss. The tapas also taste great, but they always make me terribly sick afterward. I'll keep coming back for dinner, though I think I've given up on the tapas for good.

<Content> Oh Radio Maria, how I wish we could be in love.Radio Maria is like the girl your friends try to set you up with. You hear how beautiful, how wonderful she is. Then you meet her, only to find out she bites her fingernails during dinner.This restaurant has all the makings of a high class experience. It has a pretty bar with house-infused liquor. (I especially love the ginger vodka.) There is a large tapas menu, a full service restaurant, and even a hostess!However, that's where the magical journy ends. You enter the restaurant only to be told to wait. You may, if you're like me, point out all of the empty tables and ask "why can't I sit there?" "Well," says the snooty hostess, "those are reserved." Really? You have half of your restaurant empty and those are all reserved? Ok, I'll bite. Yes, we'll be happy to sit at the bar and have a drink and wait for "about 15 minutes."At the bar, we order two delicious drinks. They're made well, even though it took a little longer than it should considering there were three people behind the bar. We decided to ask for the tapas menu so we'd be ready to order. Sure, I don't mind that this one has food spilled on it. After about 20 minutes of staring at the menu, not having any contact with the bartenders and certainly not seeing our promised table, we left, paying only for the expensive, but tasty, drinks.Will we go back? Well....no.

<Content> Eh. I have some issues with this place. It has really good potential but I definitely have mood swings about it. The main restaurant is decent. The food isn't necessarily anything I couldn't make myself but it is good, especially for me-- a vegetarian, who has had trouble finding interesting vegetarian food at many of the places in CU. Also, the wine selection is pretty decent. BUT, I think the tapas side is just terrible. We've only eaten in that part one time and I believe it was a Tuesday night, but essentially every dish we got had something wrong with it. The biggest issue was that we were served the Spanish tortilla omelet refrigerator cold. It is supposed to be GRILLED. Not grilled then put in the fridge over the weekend! We told our server and she told us that was how it was supposed to be. Alrighty then! Actually, every tapas we ordered was COLD, but this was the one that stood out the most (who wants cold eggs? Not me!!).Maybe I need to experience the brunch to give a fair assessment, but for now I'm giving 2 stars (4 for the restaurant + 1 for tapas)/2 = 2 when rounding down).

<Content> After being a loyal patron for seven years, I am done with this place. While they still have some great drink selections, the service has gotten so bad. On a Friday afternoon, I was one of six sitting at the bar. Two bartenders and 1-2 servers were working and it still took them 20 minutes to take my order. With the downtown Champaign scene evolving, this kind of situation is unacceptable.

<Content> I wish I could give the wait staff 1 star and the food a 4. I've been here 5 times, mostly for brunch. The waiters are my least favorite part of Radio Maria. That said, the prices are reasonable at brunch, so go on the weekends if you decide to check the restaurant out. There are never enough people working at brunch. We always have to flag someone down to order, to figure out where our drinks are, to get refills on our coffee, the list goes on and on. The food has been quite good; I loved the Torta Maria, the blackened salmon, and their soups, while overpriced, have been excellent. The masa boat was a little dry, but the flavors were well-balanced. I went once for dinner. The food was good, but unremarkable. I had the Korean hot pot. It was good, but I wasn't expecting it to be sweet. The portion sizes were also tiny. For half the cost, I could have gotten twice as much food at B-Won.I don't drink alcohol, so I can't say anything about their drinks, but my friends say they have one of the best-stocked bars in town and the weeknight bartender is excellent.

<Content> Nothing at this restaurant warrants the cost. The tapas servings are tiny (for tapas); brunch is inventive but disappoints. The staff always act like you're wasting their time. This place sells an image of Euro-trendiness, but it's nothing more than that image. Go to Escobar if you want expensive food WORTH the cost.

I enjoyed, particularly, the patas bravas (although I'm pretty sure they were using liquid smoke, although if I'm wrong please let me know). I'm going to leave it as 2 stars now since consistency we've had such an up and down experience over the last few months, but I'll give it some more chances in the future...

<Content> I am straight up in LOVE with the fried goat cheese balls at radio maria. i was super excited to go and enjoy some of the deliciousness that is the food, however, last week i went in with a friend and we were seated and then literally sat there for 7 minutes before someone came over to us. I was just the hostess, who said that a waiter would be over in a minute. That minute was another 7 minutes, and we didn't even have a drink order in, so we got up to leave (as we were super hungry.) The hostess shrugged and was totally unapologetic about the terrible service, so we went to jupiter's and had some delicious pizza and beers for 1/4 the price of what we were going to order.

<Content> Radio Maria was one of the first restaurants in the current resurgence of downtown. When it opened around 1996, two upscale restaurants had come and gone in the Mike n' Molly's space, and other than Great Impasta, in its old location, there was nary a place to eat downtown except in bars/ short-order cafes. RM made quite a splash, and I thought it pretty good the first several years. Nice space, creative menu (for CU), and some good servers. Then things starting going south as more and more better-quality eating places opened downtown and elsewhere. I feel they often try too hard with their entrees...too many conflicting influences and tastes. I am all for fusion cuisine done well, but I think they lose the forest for the trees here a lot. Now, the new tapas bar I like quite a bit. Very reasonable, GREAT beer list, better service, and b/c of the nature of tapas, a more focused concept and execution of cuisine. Both spaces are nice - they are adjacent to each other.

The tapas bar wasn't there when I used to come, but it is an excellent addition to this fusion style restaurant. My favorites were the egg plant frittes and the seared scallops. Hopefully it won't be another 3 years until I am back!

<Content> We came here for Sunday brunch, and ordered 3 things.Leroy's buttermilk skillet cornbread @ $4 - just one slice. [Chicago downtown's Bandera Restaurant used to have a whole mini skillet for this price 5x the portion of this, the price has since gone up.] With the word "skillet", we assumed it would came in a full skillet (even a small one, but nope!) Taste-wise nothing to write home about, the bread is just so-so. Marmalade added a nice kick to it though.Migas & Pulled Pork Eggs benedict - both were not too bad each came with a small side of their house potatoes. The deep fried house potatoes were delish. Portions of the main entree were enough, but the side potatoes was on the lighter side, almost too little. Service at 1:30 pm on a Sunday was a little slow - the place was fairly filled up, still, it seemed like they had a good number of servers, so this was a little disappointing. Nice ambient, but can get very noisy. Our overall rating of the restaurant is 2-star.

<Content> A great lunch and brunch place, but I'm less impressed by their dinner fare.I mostly go here for brunch and the food rarely disappoints. The torta Maria and smoked port torta are unusual and always good. Each week the brunch specials usually include a special omelette, scrambler, and a sandwich. The omelettes are only OK; somehow they seem a bit dry and overcooked.My main complaint with brunch is the coffee. For my past several visits it's been quite weak and it's hard to get a refill. At a weekend brunch, I do expect good, hot coffee and not to go 20 minutes with my cup empty.For dinner, I think Radio is trying to present itself as more upscale and trendy than it is. A few years ago, the menu had a much more pronounced Carribean/Cuban/South American flair to it, and I miss that. I'm sure everything on the menu is very well-prepared, but it all seems like dishes I can get at any number of places.For my last dinner experienced there, I had a tenderloin special. It consisted of two pieces of tenderloin, one correctly medium, one well-done; six gnocchi (I counted); and a scattering of green peas. I believe the sauce mentioned in the description was absent. We did have a large party, but we were sitting at an empty table for nearly an hour before our food was ready; no salads, no bread. I guess we were expected to order cocktails and appetizers. Everything was tasty and was artistically arranged on an appropriately-trendy rectangular plate, but the portions were quite small. I shouldn't leave a restaurant after a $30 entree feeling a bit peckish.I feel like Radio can't decide what it is. A fancy drink bar? A tapas bar? A haute cuisine restaurant? It does all those things fairly well, but none of them exceptionally.

<Content> We usually sit at the bar and order up tapas and drinks. The bartender never missed a chance to mix us up a mean cocktail of his own creation. The food is good and priced right. The atmosphere is also wonderful, and very unique. They also serve brunch, which is great!

<Content> As I waited over 15 minutes for the waitress to return with my initial drink order on a slow night, I hoped the tonic wasn't as flat and flavorless as the last time. It was. I ordered a Bell's HopSlam the next moment I saw the waitress, and it came only 5 minutes after I pained through the flat gin and tonic. When the tapas came 45 after my wife and I arrived, we enjoyed the mussel in miso broth special and bacon-wrapped rainbow trout with aoili. The Spanish tortilla was burnt. Luckily, the harissa helped cover up the carcinogens. Now, I wait for the waitress to return so I can ask for the bill and go to a bar with responsive service. At least it's beautiful outside.

<Content> Radio Maria is a great off campus place to go because it has a different atmosphere than other places on campus. The food is pretty good, but the tapas I was not impressed by. They were missing alot of key tapas meals, and the waitress we had the last time we went was very ditzy. None of our drinks were refilled, and it took forever to order. Will prolly go back and hope that it's a little better. I really did like the atmosphere, and the food has potential.

<Content> Food is solidly good but not brilliant compared to tapas places I've been in other towns. That being said I enjoyed the food and definitely will come back - it's creative, fresh, and varied.Kind of weird to have two kitchens/two menus that aren't coordinated - they start with an apology for it.Wine and beer list is plenty long and varied - flavors for everyone. Plus, Tuesday is 1/2 off wine by the glass night - how can you beat that?Specials were very tasty - Mahi-mahi in parchment, and a local organic heirloom tomato salad w/orange zest and balsamic - yummy!Outside tables are great on a warm summer evening.Service at times a bit slow although great service attitude and personality by our server - as with any restaurant it depends on the person you get and the night you go...Agree with 3+ stars.

<Content> The good: - the decor. It's cool on one side; wood-warm and artistic on the other.- the food, when it works.The bad: - the food, which mostly doesn't work. It's all over the map, fusing foods from every which corner. I like fusion menus just fine, but the trick with them is that the tastes have to get along with each other. Radio Maria's often behave like they've never met, never wanted to meet, and hate each other when they do meet. The result is tastes which stomp on each other in needlessly complicated food. - the service. I second whoever wrote that it's hipper-than-thou. Apparently, no one is cool enough to be in Radio Maria, much less get competent, friendly service. Just ask the wait staff - if you can get their attention. We couldn't.

<Content> My meal here was phenomenal. I got the Masa Boat Surprise. My wife got the fish tacos. The masa boat was nothing short of amazing. It looks beautiful before you start eating, at which time it turns into chaos. You eat your way down to the little masa boat that is stuffed with Mexican cheeses. A really thin omelet tops the boat, and it was so loaded with veggies and chorizo that you hardly notice that the eggs are there. That is perfect omelet in my opinion. The dish also included black beans, yummy potatoes, and salsa. All for only $8. My wife's fish tacos were great too, but not as good as we've had in other locales.

<Content> Stunning!Astounding interior!Amazing Bar!Look at the bar - the rail is a retired escalator handrail. Look above the bar, and you can see the shroud from a vane axial fan - a big one, from the former University of Illinois wind tunnel. Even the host station is a re-purposed tube radio. The center of the bar is a drink dispenser, made from a re-purposed laser. Gad - there was so much eye-candy, I had a blast!The tapas is simply amazing - every dish we ordered was good. The prices were on par for what you pay in downtown Champaign, and my daughter was smart enough to get us reservations. If you're bold enough to try a walk in, all I can say is good luck. They are reserved to the hilt usually.All in all, a good meal. We have eaten here twice, and love the place.

The service is always awesome and they have a constantly changing menu that always includes things like cheese plates, steaks, fish, frog legs, with their goat cheese boursin stuff in lots of things. Another reason going there is their great bar that has a beer selection which will please anyone who is as geeky about american craft beer as I am :-)

<Content> Came here for my birthday. Was greeted at the door by the host and led into the dining room that was dimly lit by candlelight. We ordered a couple glasses of pinot noir and were happy with their selection. Our appetizer, the broiled goat cheese, was amazing. The grilled bread provided great texture to the meaty pumpkin seed and spice spread and the divine creaminess of the goat cheese. Our entrees were the two dinner specials for the evening, seared diver scallops and a filet. Our scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The accompanying puree had pieces of bacon which perfectly complemented the entire dish. Our filet was a beautiful medium-rare piece of meat that just melted in my mouth. The bourbon demi glace and gratin brought the dish together into a very enjoyable experience. We tried two desserts, the molten chocolate cake and the green tea white chocolate mousse. I absolutely loved the mousse while my partner preferred the chocolate cake. The best part of the rich chocolate cake was the fresh mint ice cream that came with it. Overall it was an amazing dinner. Go to Radio Maria and order their dinner specials. You will not be disappointed.

<Content> The ambience at the bar is really exceptional. We always sit at the bar for tapas.. You must be in an experimental mood, this food is nowhere near "normal bar food". The sea scallops and the seared tuna will make you crave more. The bartender can accomodate any request, with a passion. We have him making key lime pie martinis, and they rock.  Fun place. Ultra Cool. Super Hip.

<Content> I've moved back to Champaign-Urbana after living here briefly 8 years ago and sooo much has changed. I feel like either the town finally realized that it would be wise to start spiffing its image up a bit to attract more students' $$ by spending some $$ or else maybe in the last 8 years, CU's been adopted by a millionaire benefactor with desire to see a small town emulate a big bad city in its gastric offerings. The restaurant scene here has improved phenomenally. My boyfriend and I popped into Radio Maria after being turned away from Bacaro for not having a reservation on a Saturday night. We both had to giggle a little as that's never happened to either of us before in Chicago but it's good to get rejected every now and then. The waitress was apologetic and nice enough about it. So next door to Radio it was and I'm so glad we gave it a chance. We hadn't been in the mood for tapas until we opened the menu. Surprisingly innovative, interesting and very hip. We tried the smoked red potatoes with aioli, the fire roasted pears with manchego shavings and fennel, spanish fusilli pasta salad with olives (which I didn't want to fuss with at first b/c I hate spitting out seeds in public but they were pitted, nice touch) and spanish olive oil. I'm not a big dessert person but since I'd been enjoying the meal so much, I splurged and ordered the pumpkin cheesecake with cinnamon cream sauce. Still thinking about it a day later...the restaurant's decor was again surprisingly hip for Champaign. The bar is lit in blue from beneath and the artwork was very urban/Japanese. There was this cool light box banner thing running the length of the artfully splash-painted brick walls that I'd love to have in our house back in Chicago. Check it out if you're in town. The waitstaff and service was also very friendly, young and attentive.

<Content> I'm a huge fan of Radio Maria, but their Valentine's Day Dinner left a very bad taste in my mouth and it wasn't the food. Radio Maria is my favorite restaurant in Champaign. The food is top-notch and the atmosphere is one of a kind. But my wife and I had their Valentine's day menu this past weekend. The food was great, but not for the outrageous cost. It was $50/person plus drinks for a "tasting" menu that wouldn't have filled up a mouse. Normally the value/price ratio is excellent. I always felt like the food was worth the cost, but not the valentine's day fixed menu. The high price combined with lack luster service took the sizzle out of what could have been a hot night.

<Content> This place is a paradox. I was there over Memorial Day weekend, on Saturday night, and had none of the issues with staff "coolness" that others reported. We were treated well and served professionally as we stayed all evening (7-11 PM). The drinks were good, though I'd say the beer was a bit small for the otherwise fair price. The odd thing is that the food is irrationally high priced - at least for the entrees. Our group of 4 ordered 3 of the specials and 1 menu item. The specials (which are not priced on the board) were simple plates of an entree & a "decorative" side. I ordered the Paella from the menu. The Paella was a 6 inch skillet of rice and seafood - 3 or so pieces each of shrimp and scallops, with some hard cooked sausage slices throughout. Good, but not special. Two of the specials were a fillet with a garlic crust - 4 oz of good meat. So what's the issue? Well $30 for the fillet and $24 for the Paella is an outrage for a remodeled VFW in a College town. This pricing is just too much like Soho/Manhattan - but it is Central Illinois! So go for the drinks and the Salsa Dancing after 10:30, but skip the food - it just is not worth it.

<Content> I just finished dinner here about an hour ago, and I'm still wondering how Radio Maria managed to get all of this attention. I guess their HUGE wine/beer/drink list was pretty impressive, but the food...was not. My first disappointment was in the size of the menu. I looked it up online and they seemed to have a wide array of choices, when I saw the actual menu, I think there were 5 entree choices, in addition to a wide variety of tapas. On top of that, the one dish I wanted, was sold out, so I went with the Smoked Duck and Brie Pizza. I mean, it was OK, there was a good amount of duck on the pizza but the whole time I was craving more brie!! They could have seriously doubled the amount of brie on the pizza and it still might not have been enough, I could hardly taste it. Also, it wasn't really a pizza at all, more like a cold flatbread, so be forewarned. I also ordered a small side salad. It was a delicious spinach salad, but lived up to the "small" definition....AND it was $6--give me a break. If I'm looking to drink, maybe I'll stop by next time I'm in town, but I'll hit up K.O. Fusion or Jim Gould over this place ANY day!

<Content> Wow, this place has really changed, now they occupy two spaces instead of one. One space is for formal dining, while the other is more casual and laid back. We sat across a huge purple bar. The menu was much different than I remembered. Instead of entrees like half chickens with grilled plantains, etc. they offered Tapas, which we didn't mind at all. In fact, we love Tapas. The best Tapas we ordered was the vegetarian paella. I wished the paella was served on a big platter like in Spain, but it was just in a tiny side dish, which I understand is part of the whole Tapas mentality, but still I wished they'd offer it on the menu as a main dish. The margarita I ordered was spot on. Not to strong, not to watered down. And their prices are extremely reasonable. We spent $47.00 without tip for six tapas, two margaritas, and one dessert, which we shared. I still love Radio Maria's, but I like the decor on the older side better.

<Content> What a unique, wonderful place! This place has 2 sides, each with their own menu: a tapas side and a restaurant side, I ate in the tapas side. Must have = eggplant frites. Their drink menu was extensive, but pricey. The service was a little slow, but granted, it was a Saturday night. The server was personable and ready to provide recommendations though. The place itself is beautiful and modern, and they decorate with art from local artists. I'd definitely go back when I visit Champaign.

<Content> I am having a hard time deciding between giving Radio Maria two and three stars. Ultimately I decided on three stars because the service is decent. The food is nothing to write home about. We had a couple of appetizers that took a long time to bring to our table. Our server was pleasant but seemed bored and/or distracted. I don't plan on going back any time soon. There are several other places downtown that are much better (i.e. Big Grove and Bacarro). Not a bad place but not great either.

<Content> My husband and I recently ate at Radio Maria for dinner. We'd had Sunday brunch and loved it at that time. In all fairness, it started out wrong. The employee seating us went to get us a table and was sidetracked by another employee at the entrance to the dining room and let us wait for at least 7 min. while he carried on an obvious flirtation/personal conversation with the other employee. He finally looked away and saw us standing at the front door and that reminded him that we were still waiting. I'm a relatively patient person but I was considering walking out at eating next door at Bacaro at that point - not because the wait was so long, but because we were so easily forgotten from the get go. It was rude.The best I can say is that the dinner service left a lot to be desired (our waitress was tired and stressed) and the accoustics of the restaurant are such that larger tables are extremely loud, making it difficult to carry on a conversation in a normal voice. The food was marginal at best although you have to give them points for creativity. Wasn't a pleasant experience and my husband became very ill later that evening and lost his meal. I wouldn't recommend it for dinnertime but may try again for brunch.

<Content> Food is great, service is great, staff is great.... Chinese Food is one of my favorite cuisines, and I've tried many place locally as well as out of town... this is one of the best. There is one other place locally that I love almost as much, but the food is there is prepared Cafeteria Style... But very well seasoned... One Wok Food is prepared as order.. and some items could use a little more seasoning.The Restaurant has a open kitchen, so you can see that it is clean and watch as your food is being prepare.I have never been in there when I wasn't greeted with a friendly and warm hello and a smile, no matter how busy they are..... Most of the time I call in my order and it's always ready when promised.. The price match the quantity...

<Content> just a okay place for Americanized Chinese food(you know, general tsao's chicken, beef broccoli, sweet sour pork and such). decent amount, but mostly on the bland side. Sometimes i just wish they could put something (M.S.G, chicken stock, oyster sauce or whatever works) into their cooking to make the dishes more flavorful! really, but mostly it just taste like soy sauce. *sign* but the people work their are nice. :) they wont greet you overwhelmingly(big smile, "hi", "how are you" and stuff), just generally being nice. ps. try their dumplings, there are huge! i like them~

<Content> I really think this is some of the best Chinese food in Champaign. I was an Empire fan for the longest, but one dish from Number one Wok is definitely more savory than Empire or Evo in comparison. They are a little heavy on their pork inclusions to fried rice and egg rolls, but I enjoy swine so the more for me.

<Content> Ok - So - My fiancee and I are driving down Green and he looks at me and says, "Listen - I want Chinese Food tonight - and while I know that We've never been there - I think it's time that we give No. 1 Wok a try. After all, they are making a pretty staunch declaration and I think that deserves our attention."I am glad we did. Their food, while not unbelievable or incredible, is always good and doesn't break the piggy bank. I suggest the Chow Fun. It's very good and not TOO greasy...

<Content> The food here isn't great but it isn't bad either. It's cheap but Champaign has lots of great Chinese options such as Lai Lai Wok or Golden Harbor nearby. Among the cheaper options though, this is about par.

<Content> Food is actually pretty delicious. Price is okay, but the amount that they give you is amazing. Definitely worth going for if you want good quick Chinese food

<Content> Bad. Just plain bad. It's hard to believe that Chinese people make this food. It has so little resemblance to Chinese food. Number 1? Starting from last place?I can't remember what I had. It's better that I didn't, because whatever I ordered has nothing to do with what I was given.

<Content> Cheap and perfectly adequate. The kind of place you order from because it's close and cheap. If you're willing to travel farther, wait longer, or spend more, go elsewhere. But this is a fine option, and you can get a lunch special with an entree and fried rice for $4.50. I like the broccoli with garlic sauce--the sauce is good but not great, but the broccoli is perfectly cooked. Mmm.

<Content> I love this place for take out Chinese. I tend to get the sesame chicken combo and fried wontons which are both very good. When I get other things I am happy with the food. I use to go to First Wok all the time because I lived near it but now I am far away from it and find that this place is just as good if not better. They are always very pleasant, quick, and I find the prices very reasonable.

<Content> So far, I've visited three Chinese restaurants on Green Street. Number One Wok is pretty good, there are some things I like about it. First, its an open kitchen and you can see that the order taker and the cook are coordinating orders so that its efficient and fast. Next, its easy to get in-and-out, with a big parking lot. (If you need liquor, the Hollywood Liquor, formerly Hollywood Video, is next door.) They are also really nice - a warm smile when handing me my order.The food was quite good, healthy portion, and a lower price than the other restaurants ($5.19 for a small Beef dish.) The beef and veggies were good; the only complaint was that the seasonings were bland. I've only tried one dish there, so I'll try something else next time. There are several other Chinese places on Green other than the three I've tried, so it may be a while before I settle on my favorite place. Recommended as a low priced, friendly place to eat. The carry-out was ready quickly, and was very well packed. The dining room is more than adequate, it is spacious but dated.

<Content> Another review from a few years back, really sorry, but wanted to make note of the places I loved when we lived in Champaign.OK, I read a lot of reviews a few years back (when this review was current) and found that people considered a place called First Wok a hidden gem. Well, I didn't want to drive to First Wok. Then Number One Wok opened (yes, this review is from when this business opened). I picked up their menu. It was almost exactly the same as First Wok. Were they related? Sure looked like it. Are they still? No idea. Anyway, I found the menu amusing. A lot of Chinese food menus have bad descriptions of the food and typos but this menu had NO Descriptions. It was like a shot in the dark to figure out what some of the things were going to be. So I gave it a try. And I really liked it. No, I didn't order any of the standard things like sweet sour whatever or broccoli cow. I randomly picked things based on the protein or noodle base or whatever caught my attention. I did this four or five times before I got some favorites going. By the time my favorite order was going in once a week I was very happy with my food. My mother came to visit and even SHE thought it was pretty damn good. FYI our background is Chinese born in Hawaii where things might not be exactly authentic but good tasting food is super important.  A caveat: Takeout food is in a different category than sit down restaurant. I am not comparing this place to the Chinese banquet restaurants. That just wouldn't be fair.

<Content> Well, their sign says it all, "No 1 wok"; as in, No, don't bother trying it.I ordered a combination plate and asked for fried rice, but got white, the egg role was terribly overdone, and the sweet and sour chicken was just ok.For the price, I would go to a few other places in Champaign-Urbana and get much better quality.

<Content> I used to go to Red Herring at least once/twice a week during my undergrad years.In my opinion, the best lunch option near campus, and never as packed as some of the shittier places nearby. Soup and sandwiches were always great, and the entrees were good too. I could never convince my friends to come with me, because they were idiots.The food definitely fluctuated in terms of taste/quality depending on who was working that day. I still remember a specific dish I had back in '05 that still ranks among the top 10 things I have ever eaten. Unfortunately, by comparison, nothing else from there ever lived up to that one dish, even though it was always excellent.

<Content> The food is bland and the portions meager, but as the only dedicated vegetarian restaurant on campus, Red Herring gets stars for being cool. Surface over substance.

<Content> I had lunch here for the first time yesterday. I had the falafel salad and the soup of the day, I think it was called Samosa. Both things were excellent, Im probably going back today for their fusion meal.SO GLAD I FOUND THIS PLACE! No better way to spend $10 for lunch!

<Content> I loved this place. The atmosphere is lovely and relaxed and so is the food. I've been meaning to come here for quite some time, but the hours that they are open never match up with when I have wanted to go. The hours are pretty random and short but it is worth planning a trip. The food is very good and very fresh, it is a little pricey for the portion size, which is pretty small, but it was worth it. I would recommend for any vegans, vegetarians, ethnic cuisine lovers, or just healthy eaters!

<Content> All I want is for this place to do well. It deserves it.Basically, if you survive the terrifyingly steep steps downstairs, you'll enter what appears to be a speakeasy beneath the Unitarian Center. And by speakeasy, I don't mean Prohibition Chicago era hideouts for liquor runners, I mean a Vegetarian Speakeasy for hippies--the best kind of speakeasy. :)The decor is eclectic and homemmade. It basically looks like a co-op and is inhabited by the usual college town cast of characters: hipsters, professors, crunchy folk, punkers, and any person who likes great food.I enjoyed my butternut squash bisque soup and was disappointed that they were out of cornbread today--Keep that in mind and come relatively early to avoid having them run out of foodage. Otherwise, you should enjoy.Go and at least check out this awesome local community spot that really seems to care about the area around it. Good call. :)One note, they only take cash, much like the Y-Thai. But really, if you're eating on campus, you should spend your money on places like Y-Thai or Red Herring rather than the soulless, corporate eateries lining Green Street in CampusTown.And there's free wifi. Hot damn.

<Content> NEW MANAGEMENT ALERT! The Red Herring is a local institution but the quality changes dramatically as the place has passed through many hands. I recall with some fear the staff of years past: one cashier enjoyed candidly sharing with me stories of their disagreements with the health department. (This was as I ordered food.) But that has changed. The new manager is reportedly the same person who originally opened the place in the 1970s (says the cashier). As a regular visitor for seven years, I found the effect striking.The food was good! Not just a passable alternative option as Mimi N. wrote, or something that vegetarians must eat out of desperation after they tire of green salad and fruit plate from the local chains. The red herring is not the only option for those with a lentil craving anymore. It is a place that you might actually go to for the food -- food that is actually good. It didn't taste like the Red Herring I know at all; it tasted a lot better.I had the corn chowder and the ingredients were obviously carefully selected and very fresh. The kernels had a crisp, sweet bite. The toasted mozzarella sandwich was also a treat with good quality cheese and fresh bread.Unfortunately, while change is good in this case, I did notice the portion sizes have declined dramatically. Maybe they are still working this out? (I hope.)I spent $7 for a half sandwich and cup of soup, and almost immediately I found that I had to go out to a second lunch. It was the smallest half sandwich I have ever been seriously offered and charged for. At first I mistook it for a sample or a scrap trimmed from someone else's sandwich. I would have preferred a bowl of soup but this tiny cup size was the only choice. $7 for a sandwich trimming and a tiny cup of soup is a little steep around here.So enjoy the food but don't order half of anything -- the result will be too small. Rest assured that the crunchy atmosphere you love is still there... but cleaner. The staff still seems to be the kind of staff that will say "Peace out!" after you complete your order and will lend you money if you are short.Peace out!

<Content> On an icy winter's day, Red Herring soup melts my insides. I'll reject red meat any day for it. Their soup menu changes daily... and everyday it's made fresh by volunteers. So - if you're low on cash, you can work here in exchange for food. Not too shabby!I have heard rave reviews about the Krishna dinner... and damn! I forget almost every Monday. But how could the reviews be wrong? Five bucks for an all you can eat, organic, home cooked meal? Damn straight!

<Content> With a new and seemingly permanent chef --no more revolving door of student cooks, it seems-- the quality of the food at the Red Herring has improved drastically. Consistently flavorful and fresh, eating at the Red Herring no longer reminds me of my wayward youth eating the bland, overcooked lentil leftovers from my friends' shifts cooking for Food Not Bombs. The menu is streamlined with a few regular offerings --half and whole falafel or PB&J sandwiches-- and rotating soups, salads, and entrees. I've had several of the soups and salads now (black bean chili, curry butternut squash, potato and cheddar, to name a few) and each has been delicious thus far. The bowl of chili is even filling! However, I would warn against taking your meal to go because of the aforementioned portion problem -- for soups, I've been given a medium paper coffee cup only a third full when I've ordered a bowl's worth. The staff was happy to give me more once I noticed, but since then I've tried to just eat my food there.While I like the bartering premise of the shared labor --sign up for an hour's worth of work and get a free meal-- this does provide for some inadvertent hi-jinks at the cash register and in the kitchen. I came one day when there were clearly too many volunteers on the shift who hadn't yet been trained, and I found myself unable to look away from the comedic fumblings (tickets being moved around the counter with orders being filled twice as a result, and a hilarious attempt to bag my soup in several plastic bags, each abandoned once the realization hit again and again that a cup of soup is NOT going to stay upright in a plastic bag). It was like watching a sit-com kitchen, but live! I enjoyed it immensely.That said, the service is usually quick and friendly, with plenty of smiles!

<Content> Oh, Red Herring! Be still my heart. I loved this place before I ever considered eating vegan, and it's been a haven for me since then. The specials never fail to delight, so much so that I went six months never trying a regular menu item because I was so entranced by the daily specials. The BBQ seitan is outta control good--so fantastic that I find myself picking up the escaping pieces of seitan with my fingers and then licking the sauce off. The falafel is phenomenal as well. Meat-eaters, have no fear. I've brought many a devout omnivore to Red Herring, and they've raved about their eats as well. The chef does a fantastic job of dreaming up dishes that are flavorful and filling (and still pretty damn cheap). I find the whole sandwich fills me up nicely for $5, and the specials are always a meal-and-a-half for a bit more.I'm sad they weren't able to keep dinner service going, but I've got my fingers crossed they'll revisit that another time. Red Herring, thank you for satisfying my stomach, making sure this mostly vegan gal never feels frustrated grabbing a lunch out, and helping me feel completely guiltless about eating out.

<Content> If there is one thing I mass about ol' Chambana - it's Red Herring. This place is just so wonderful. Where do I start?My typical memory of it would be walking in on a blisteringly cold day. I'd be greeted by steamy warm, earthy air. My glasses would fog up and I'd go blind for a moment. Once the fog disappeared I'd be greeted with a wide variety of the community - from the still thinks-it's-the-70s hippie to the like-oh-my-god-check-out-my-North-Face-fleece! sorority girl - everybody is represented. Definitely more hippies than greeks - but yeah. I suppose I fall in the middle there and never felt out of place.The place is staffed mostly by volunteers who as I recall get paid with a meal for a certain amount of work. Go there for a little while and you'll quickly get to know the staff - they're all great.So next it's time to order. They have their daily menu listed and it's always different. Prices are not bad - $5-8 will get you a full meal as I recall.So the food - I have yet to buy something here that wasn't fantastic. Maybe I'm easy to please (as some of the other reviewers would make one think) - but geeze - it's all so great! There is a clear stand out though - the BBQ tempeh sandwich. I've tried to recreate this item at home (since I now live halfway across the country!) but I just can't get it as good as Red Herring did.I've taken many people here - from red blooded meat lovers to normal folk and everybody else - and I have yet to hear a complaint. Fantastic place - highly recommended!

<Content> I am a former vegetarian working nearby, but was scared to come here. On a previous visit, a friend and I left because of the crowd, which I know now was probably a buffet night.I'm glad I finally got over it and gave it a try, because that was some of the best falafel I've ever had. I also had the curry soup, which was very flavorful and seasoned just right. A half falafel "sandwich" (which includes popcorn and a dill spear), cup of soup du jour, and a cookie cost me roughly $7. They also have a water cooler with a stack of non-disposable cups.

<Content> I'm a carnivore, but this place is so delicious. It might be one of the only places to get real, non-greasy food around campus. It always makes me feel satisfied for several hours, whereas other places you feel hungry about an hour later.Om nom nom! Try a cup of chili with brown rice + veggies.Furthermore on fridays they have a really sweet band playing, today there was a guitar, banjo, and a double-bass. Awesome.

<Content> Let me start by saying that I really like this place. Until just recently, I've only been here for lunch (which never disappoints). Having just gone to my first Monday night krishna buffet, I am in total awe. The food was unbelievably tasty, cheap, and there was an overall jolly atmosphere going around.If I could take off a half-point, I'd only do so for the times that I'm not carrying any cash on me. Besides that, I love this place.

<Content> We were actually brought here by Annie W. during our visit to UIUC. (Not sure if you can tell, she's a big fan!)I ordered half a hummus pita with a garden salad on the side. I actually liked the hummus, although I don't eat hummus as much as I'd like to. There were lots of fresh veggies in there, although the distribution through my little pita pocket was a bit awkward. (Chock full o' hummus on one side, lots of veggies on the other.) I ordered the salad with the sesame tahini, but I wasn't a huge fan of the tahini. I don't eat tahini often, though, so maybe I'm just not a tahini person? (The vinaigrette would've complemented the meal better.) The meal was served with some plain popcorn.I found my meal okay, but I would definitely be cautious to omnivores (and especially carnivores xD). Many of the people I was eating with were pretty dissatisfied with the flavors in their food? Even the little bottle of hot sauce (I think it was a kind of salsa?) wasn't really doing much to quench their hunger. I'm a bit more used to vegetarian food, but if your friends aren't used to vegetarian food, this is probably not the place to try to introduce them to it.I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, but again, it can come off as "weird" and "hippie-ish" for people who aren't used to it. We had a guy playing BOTH the guitar and the xylophone up front and, not going to lie, he was reinforcing the stereotype of "hippie-ish" in this restaurant with his look a wee bit, according to some of my lunchmates.But I liked it. There was a little station for you to fill up on water, iced tea, or hot tea, cane sugar, organic teas... considering that you're not paying a whole lot, I thought that you got a pretty great deal, ESPECIALLY if you are a vegetarian or a vegan, you know? However, if you're bringing a friend who has never heard of seitan and doesn't really like that organic feel, then this is the wrong place to bring him/her. If you're into that, though, this is an AWESOME place. Even the back of the bathroom door contributed to the overall feel of this restaurant that I had to descend into. It is very much like a co-op (if you've been to one before), but I'll admit, not everyone is going to love it. I personally liked it, though.

<Content> It is so nice to have a vegan restaurant in CU. I see another is opening and claiming to be the first. Well The Red Herring was first a long time ago and it is great. The variety of flavors offered makes it a place you can return to often. The atmosphere is, well, laid back and comfy. Nice in the middle of a frenetic day. The staff is always friendly and welcoming and they know their dishes enough to make great recommendations. In short, whether you are vegan or not you should visit The Red Herring and enjoy a great lunch served with a smile in a place that begs for a good book or a good friend to join you. Try it. You'll like it.

<Content> 5 buck karma-free Monday night dinner? Gotta give that a shout out. Anyplace that satisfies my evening grubbin' needs that cheaply can make the whole day seem even better.Down the steep stairs and into the warm scent of good hippie eats. You get in line, toss your fiver in a basket, and are given large portions of whatever they cooked up.Tonight was rice, veggies with Indian flavors, kick-ass lentil soup, and a brownie. Drinks cost extra, water is free with dinner. You can eat as much food as can be shoveled down.The atmosphere is like a laid-back commune, with a smattering of all campus types. Punk, hippie, geek, frat/soror, etc. It's a really friendly place with a community-building-is-awesome vibe.My friends who've been in town awhile say it can be a tad hit or miss. Tonight was for the win, fo' sho'. Another tip I was given is to bring a Tupperware. If you accidentally get more seconds than you can eat, you'll be able to have some noms for lunch the next day. Or, ya know, snacking on the way home. It might be a little less karma free that way, though...

<Content> After living in the area for many years, I finally got a chance to try The Red Herring. I took my wife to lunch on a Friday afternoon. Service was friendly and questions were answered politely.I had the Dragon Bowl special, which was very good. I only wish that I had ordered the full portion instead of the half portion. My wife ordered a tofu dish (not sure exactly which one) which was excellent. She also wished that she had ordered the full portion.The prices were fair and we had a good first experience here. We will return.

<Content> This is probably one of the few places on campus I can depend on to get food that won't lead to a grease coma. The food tastes fresh and healthy. The downside may be that the portions are a little small compared to other restaurants for the same price. I would recommend the chili with a cornbread muffin.

<Content> OK, I'll admit it- I generally detest vegetables, so the idea of a vegan restaurant did not initially appeal to me. However, thanks to the Red Herring, I have been converted to the veggie cause. The Red Herring is staffed by dedicated volunteers and generally these are people quite knowledgeable in the ways to making vegetables delectable. It's a small place, nothing fancy, but it's quite nice for a non-for-profit establishment. On a cold day there I always like to get their $3.00 bowl of vegetable soup with corn bread. The soups, like the entrees and desserts, vary each day. Some days might be better or worse than others, but I can usually find something I like. The corn bread is the wonderful constant in this equation. It's soft and melts in your mouth. Besides the cornbread, the next best thing is the ingredients. They use lots of local and organic products.Even if you are not exactly crunchy and you like your red meat, I suggest trying The Red Herring. Hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised.P.S. They are now serving dinner.

<Content> I REALLY want to like this place. On paper it sounds amazing, super healthy vegan/vegetarian food. Lots of organic, free trade type stuff.Unfortunately it usually fails to impress. The dishes usually bland and uninteresting (mostly stews and vegan imitations of american and western european meat dishes that most meat eaters don't even like that much, like beef stroganoff for example). On top of that I made the trip out there on four separate occasions only to find the place was closed with a note on the door saying "Sorry we are too tired to cook today. Here's a recipe if you want to make your own dinner." WTF. I know this place is a non-profit but they seem to reject the notion that a business should strive to please their customers if they expect to survive. Of course only greedy capitalists care about such things..

I had the BBQ seitan and for someone who doesn't eat that type of thing normally it was actually pretty good. It had the look, feel, and taste of bbq pork. I also had a side salad that had a yummy herb vingearatte. I don't think I would go back again because I like my meat but it was definitely tasty and if you are looking for a vegetarian type of place definitely go check it out!!

The Krishnas put on a Monday night meal, all you can eat for $5. Very peaceful and cooperative, and spiritually and gastronomically healthy.

<Content> This is easy to miss in the Unitarian corner building near the foreign language and across from the science building. It's a place you have to come to, though, if you like vegetarian fare and really one of your only legit options if you want vegan and don't want to just have a celery stick or raw veggies at some other restaurant. All food is freshly prepared, their main menu item changes every day. On top of this all it's fairly cheap as well. Definitely a place you have to go and try out.That said, I have talked to a connected friend who told me horror stories about the management changes as well. I guess it passes between different people since it's run by the Unitarians and there is some sort of committee for it. Apparently sometimes the place was not run in a, shall we say, cleanly and efficient manner. That said, I hear the current manager, just like nifty c. says, is very good and the place is top quality.

<Content> I really wanted to like this place, being both vegetarian and right next to my building. After several visits though, I had to concede that it just isn't that good. Tables are constantly dirty. Food is inconsistent, too expensive for the quality and portion size, and generally not very tasty.The employees are in a constant state of confusion, seemingly overwhelmed by the trickle of customers during the lunchtime "rush". The ordering process is inefficient, with very little thought put into organization of the process.Basically, this place has all of the drawbacks of a small, quirky cafe, with virtually none of the payoff. I am currently at the restaurant again, having given in to proximity over quality, and I am regretting it.

<Content> So I'm not really a vegetarian, but I like to be a poser, I ate at Field of Greens while in the dorms and I eat here when I actually have my lunch hour free on campus. Sure a lot of people have said this can be hit or miss, but I find the hummus sandwiches to be excellent every time. They always have fresh veggies on them and have a lot of flavor, plus the homemade wheat bread is awesome. The sweet potato and corn chowder is quite good as well. Alas I still haven't been able to try the cornbread, it seems they always run out within the two people ordering in front of me, so get there early if you can. The coffee isn't outstanding, for that I would walk down the street to Espresso. Great place to support and cheap eats, I usually spend no more than $6. Basically you should go if you are on campus for lunch and want a healthy alternative to chains on green st.

<Content> I haven't been to a Long John's for years. I had a coupon and a fish craving so I went through the drive through for lunch. I ordered the fish and more with corn instead of fried. The fish is really quite good. The corn sticks to your teeth and is chewy. The cole slaw is cold and crunch and good. Not the best but not the worst either. Hush puppies are Hush puppies whatever they are. This meal is neither fantastic nor awful. But it is expensive. I really like BW3's buffalitto lunch special and I can get that for 5.99 where as this average meal is 6.99. Glad I had a coupon but that still make it's 5.99. I'm also thinking this deep fried fish isn't very good for me as I wipe the grease dripping from my mouth!

<Content> Recently, I received a 1 page LJS advertisement (coupon page) in either the Chicago Tribune or the local News Gazette newspaper. It contained a variety of different options (coupons).Last Saturday night, October 6th, I went through the drive-through lane and ordered two meals.When I reached the pay window I presnted a coupon. The clerk, after a couple of minutes, told me he could not accept the coupon, because I did not tell him I was using it when I placed my order!!!  I told him this was unacceptable, since nowhere on the coupon or anywhere else was I told I had to mention the coupon when I placed the order. I therefore paid, accepted my order, and departed.On the way home, my son and I joked how silly and inappropriate this transaction was. We decided one action would have been to cancel the order, then drive around and reorder it mentioning this time that we were using the coupon! I reiterate that I was not informed anywhere that I had to mention the coupon when placing an order.Other than Company Policy, I assume the refusal of the coupon was because of one or maybe two reasons.  FIRST, the employee entered the purchase when I ordered, and did not know how, or have authority, to override the register.   The SECOND more serious possibility is that there are two varieties/quantities of merchandise offered to the customer -- one for a regular-cost purchase, and another cheaper one for coupon use!Either way, I think the advertising is deceptive because it did not say anywhere that the coupon must be presented when the order is placed in a drive-through. This deceptive advertising should be publicized in the same manner that the coupons are issued.

<Content> Restaurant reviewAYCE steak sounds great in principal... but this was a disappointing experience. It has been a while since I have been back here and was expecting a nice BBQ type restaurant like Golden Corral. This is the first time I had to eat the chicken from the buffet because I ran out of other things I wanted to eat. Don't get me wrong the sirloin steak is good, very tender likely from meat tenderizer used. Well seasoned and cooked the way you like it. The major downside is beside the steak the buffet is missing many of the bbq type items you would expect like corn on the cob, sausage, pork chop etc. Instead there is your fried chicken, mac/cheese, mashed potato. I agree with the other reviews this place is rather dirty. people will finish eating and the tables will not be cleaned for over 1 hour. There is spilled food all over the place. I can honestly say I will not be visiting again based on this experience.Pro: AYCE buffet, relatively inexpensive 11 dollars for dinner, free for children under 2Cons: dirty, limited food options, poor service (the guy who was running the grill made no eye contact and felt like he was doing you a service by serving you a piece of steak)Hidden gem:Sign up online for BOGO coupon through the crave connection

<Content> The food at this Ryan's is actually pretty decent, but the overall experience is severely marred by a total lack of cleanliness in the dining and serving areas. The dessert bar was particularly revolting during our visit--mostly as a result of their failure to enforce the rule against unattended children at the buffet.On the positive side, they offer a military discount. And the lady who refilled our tea was very nice. But our family will not be returning to this location.

<Content> I took a group of eight here for a birthday lunch on Monday afternoon. We went because it was close, we had coupons and figured that, for the same price as Taco Bell, we could get a decent lunch. I didn't check Yelp reviews or look at the buffet before paying. My mistake! This place is filthy, the food looks and tastes like it comes out of freezer bags and some of the temperatures had me worried. Seriously, the corn on the cob still had ice crystals on it! The odor from the dessert prep area caused several of us to lose our appetite and we left wishing we'd spent the money at Taco Bell. I was disappointed because usually we have a good experience at Ryans and their sister buffets. I called their corporate office and complained. In their defense, the district manager did call me the next day to address our concerns. He said they would look into things and also were sending us some VIP passes so we could have another meal on them. However, after reading reviews on this place from two and three years ago complaining about the same issues, I have a hard time believing its going to improve. So for now, it's eat at your own risk!

<Content> I was disappointed at my recent visit to Ryan's. I used to love coming here during my U of I days, but it has been some time since I ate here and things have gone downhill. First, the buffet seems so much smaller than it used to be, with less choices than before. The food was meh, just stuff to fill my hungry stomach. As for the atmosphere, it looks like they haven't improved the interior since I was there last. The tables and chairs are old, and the rugs and walls seem worn. The only positive was a nice waitress that kept are drinks full and cooed over how cute my son is...an extra star just for that.

<Content> Ryan's is the kind of place that always has a standard of food that is generally a little above average.In their averageness, there are times you get amazing hot n tasty food. And there are times when the food has been warmed a little longer in the steam table that it should have been rotated off a while ago.They serve breakfast on Saturday and Sunday. If you go then, you get the treat of a hot n fresh custom omelette made to order.The rolls are always good. The service is always attentive.Today .. the food was on the better than average side. I had a coupon to get an extra $1 off for breakfast that was sent to me in email as I'm part of their club. Generally, if I have a coupon, I'll visit as it helps the overall value. If I don't have one, then it depends on the occasion or how hungry I am.For Ryan's.. a good visit. Better than most visits. 3 stars.

<Content> Of buffets, I've never been to anything worseOld Country Buffet (or OCB for those who have frequented there as children) could run circles around this place (if these buffets were running some kind of circular track race). Food:1. I sampled a little bit of everything except for the salad bar. The salad bar looked super lame. And everything tasted like it had come out of a freezer and was immediately heated in hot oil. Then saturated with salt.2. To give you a point of reference, I ate meals from the dorms for four years. The dorm food was better. significantly. 3. I will concede on one point- their steaks were actually not too bad. Price:1. $12.00 per person. (WHAAAA?- Just use your money on 2 Chipotle burritos). 2. Extra cost for drinks. I was tired and asked for a coffee. DONT make my mistake. It was horribly awful. Worse than Mary Ann's. 3. Why would anyone pay this much money for this??People:1. So at buffets, the staff help take away plates and refill drinks. Did this happen at Ryan's? Uh like once. We had a stack of dishes waiting for 30 min to be taken away. Which meant no one refilled our drinks or took away our dished for most of the meal. 2. I went with a group of young 20 people and we stuck out like sore thumbs. Most of the people were older, whiter, and larger. Ambiance:If you've ever gone to OCB, it's just like it. Unless you like overpriced unappealing oversalted food, my suggestion is to skip Ryan's.

<Content> I was afraid to eat most of the items offered in the buffet. Almost everything looked icky. Our booth was sticky and there were bits of food all over the carpet. I felt like I needed a Purell bath afterward.If you eat a lot in one sitting and don't care what it is, then this buffet is for you. Otherwise, spend your $10 somewhere more pleasant.

<Content> As far as buffets go, this place is fairly decent. During dinner hours and during Sunday lunch they offer all you can eat Steak. The steak is pretty tasty in my opinion, but it's nothing to write home about.The rest of the items are Ok too, the deserts are pretty good.I'll probably eat there again in the future. You really shouldn't be expecting anything more from a $10 all you can eat buffet type restaurant.

<Content> Ryan's provides great value for the money, but don't expect to eat a fine steak. The buffet has a wide variety of decent tasting choices. The service is friendly and efficient. The steak is only offered as sirloin. For the $10 price range, you couldn't expect much more.

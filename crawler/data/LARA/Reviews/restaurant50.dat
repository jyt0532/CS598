<Content> I visited The Dancing Dog this evening and had an excellent meal, and the service was wonderful as well. The staff are very friendly, and everything on the menu (including the wine) is 100% vegan. I had the vegan fish and chips.I think the vegan fish pieces (there were three) are Sophie's Choice brand, and the deep fry the pieces, so if you are looking for vegan health food, the might not be the dish for you. However, if you want the closest thing I've ever tasted to British-style fish and chips, this would be it. The tartar sauce was tasty and the coleslaw was some of the best I've had anywhere. For dessert, I ordered the chocolate chocolate chip, cookie, which was also excellent. Dense and chocolatey, slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.All in all, I would definitely visit here again the next time I'm in Urbana. Any vegans and vegetarians in town should feel lucky to have this wonderful restaurant.

<Content> Such a pleasure to have delicious vegetarian options in Urbana! I had the black bean and tempeh tacos with a quinoa corn side dish. Delish!

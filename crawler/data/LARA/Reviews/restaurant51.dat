<Content> The service is always amazing here...but last night, there were 15 people in line and only one person working the cash register! The staff is always friendly and go out of the way to make sure you have everything you need. My ONLY complaint is that there is not a turkey burger option. We love this place!

<Content> Decent burgers but for the price you can get better in town. The best reason to come here though is the cheese fries. Their cheese sauce is uhhh-mazing! The staff is always very friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming and clean. We eat here from time to time but since it ends up running about 30 bucks for two people we go here sparingly (or when we crave those cheese fries!!)I love that they give you sea salt grinders amd pepper grinders insteaf of the ol stuff we are all used to. Nice touch.

<Content> I come here when I'm craving a burger with my own pizazz. It's a little pricy, but they give you tons of fries and I enjoy the fancy soda machines. If they mess up something, they will acknowledge it and fix it immediately. They want you to leave a full and happy customer.

<Content> Went here one time after driving by it thousands of times. Just had the taste for a good burger. I was shocked in a good way. Very well put together restaurant, simple enough menu, excellent staff (the girl on the register was in training even), and the food was ready very quickly and they were busy. The food was excellent btw. Excellent burger and fries.

<Content> When I first arrived, the line was out the door which I thought was both a good sign about the food and a sign that this might take a while. But the cashiers were speedy and maybe the customers were decisive as well. The concept of this place is similar to that of Chipotle--you pick what toppings you want on your burger or you can choose one of their predefined burgers. I went with the second option and ordered the californian with regular fries and a drink which came to a total of just under $12. Kind of a lot for a meal at a fast-food like place but I was hungry so whatever. My meal was pretty good and there was a ton of fries in the "regular" portion. They were thin and crispy as well which I loved. The burger itself was good, it did fall apart a little bit when I tried to eat it, but there were a good amount of toppings so that was predictable. I was disappointed in the amount of cucumber wasabi on my burger as I was really looking forward to that. I feel like I only tasted it in one bite. Instead I just added some of the specialty spicy chipotle kethcup available which was delicious and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like ketchup and eats her fries dry. They also have Coca-Cola freestyle machines were you can pretty much have any Coke drink imaginable so that's cool. It also means the person in line behind me gets irritated because I like to check out all of my options before making a decision.

<Content> Man, this burger will haunt my dreams. We came across this place while we were in town for friend's wedding and we could not have been more impressed. I loved the warm, friendly staff and the fast arrival of our food. To top that, I loved the juicy burgers and chicken tenders (probably the best I've ever had - seriously!). It really hit the spot for dinner. My only wish is that you would expand out and create a location in California! Love this place and highly recommend!

<Content> I don't go for fancy dancy burgers, like wasabi or fried egg and weird flavors. But if you like that, they have it at Meatheads. There are tons of choices to put atop your burger.All fresh. It's an adult fast food atmosphere. I like the regular old cheese burger, so I got a 1/3 lb. burger, which is two thin  patties. All in all, it was tasty, it was almost everything I wanted in a hamburger. Fresh ingredients. The patties are fresh, never frozen, as per the manager. It was very tasty and our order came out fast, and the staff was friendly, the place is clean. The fries are really good. Crispy, thin (but not too thin) and salty!!!I'd go here again for a quick burger. UPDATE: I had a nice email from the manager, I would patronize this place again because it appears he CARES!!!

<Content> Our favorite burger place in Champaign. Great burger and fries. My favorite combination is Hawaiian burger with cajun fries. The fries portion is quite big, which could be enough for two. Beside the food, what makes us keep coming back to this place is its staffs - very friendly with smiles always on their face. Highly recommend when coming to Champaign!

<Content> I liked it. Despite some not so positive reviews, they have a really good burger joint here. Found the place to be immaculately clean. Even the mensroom was spotless. A lot cleaner than most of my recent Five Guys visits that had peanuts all over the floor, and garbage on top of the tables (China Town DC--you know who you are!).They kill you with too many fries, the burgers were good, very tasty and cooked to perfection, but my work colleague said his burger was too small. I felt my 1/2lb burger was appropriately sized. Service was friendly and fantastic and a manager-looking guy even bused our table.It's great to see a burger place like this offer a drive thru window.

<Content> We have been to Meatheads in both Champaign and Bloomington. Both times it was delicious! The burgers beat the heck out of Five Guys, and the fries do too! Especially the cajun fries! And you MUST try the cheese sauce for dipping...yummy and a little spicy. The milk shakes are for real, too. Great, now I'm hungry...

<Content> Just finished a wonderful salad called "the chopped wedge." Ordered it as listed on the menu board but added the crispy chicken. The iceberg lettuce was cold and crisp. I asked my husband when he had ever seen me eat a salad without dressing. Answer was "never." That' s how great this salad was. Have to add the blue cheese vinaigrette was very good ... I dipped my chicken in it! Great staff every time we go.

<Content> First of all I do not care for hamburgers but once in a while I will get one. I drove by Meatheads and noticed they had a drive through.& I decided to give it a try. Not a big menu. I had the kids meal which included french fries, cheeseburger and a teeny tiny drink.I am also not huge fan of french fries either (yes, I am American) but as far as french fries go these were excellent. The cheeseburger was OK too. I think it taste just like Culver's. You can get a cheaper burger at Culver's but their french fries are gross so if you are going for the whole meal thing this place would be your best bet. And they don't skimp on the FF, they give you plenty!!!The staff in the drive through were super nice.I tried to do a check in on Yelp here but it did not list it on my phone for some reason.

<Content> Surprisingly a not so great place for meatheads to eat. Food is really greasy. That's probably the main ingredient, grease. They drown everything in fats and their cajun spices to mask the mediocrity of their other ingredients. I would not recommend this place but it's not inedible.

<Content> This place's burgers remind me of Five Guy's with more options. I'm impressed with many of their burgers, and my kids have enjoyed the chicken, too. I'd put their fries up against anyone's. The only restaurant that has better fries anywhere is Arthur Bryant's in Kansas City. I'm as pleased as I can be that they have a reading incentive program for kids. My kids are actually doing this and enjoying it. As others have mentioned, the freestyle drink machines are great. So what's not to like?!Did I mention my 5 year old likes to call them "Beefheads"? That's worth the trip by itself!

<Content> As an update re: my last review, I was contacted by regional management and was asked very nicely for specifics about why our experience was unsatisfactory. After voicing my complaints, I was offered a generous gift card ($25) for my feedback, which was not necessary but we appreciated it. We've already used it, and the service experience seemed better this time. While it's still a bit steep price-wise, I do like the burgers and it's comparable to several other fast-food places in town.Just want them to get the credit they deserve for following up so quickly to my relatively unknown Yelp posting to make things right.

The staff is incredibly friendly, the food arrives fast, and you can build your own delicious burger. So stop eating crap burgers from McDonald's/Burger King/Wendy's and other cheap fast food joints. Upgrade to Meatheads!

The restaurant was very clean and the service was also excellent. The food came so quickly and they clean up for you right away when you are finished.

<Content> As far as drive-thrus go, this one is definitely on the nicer end, especially given it's location. There's really not much else around on that strip of Neil St. besides other chain restaurants.I had it for the first time the other day on my way out of town and got the Californian, a burger with avocado and this amazing wasabi cucumber sauce. It was pretty tasty. Definitely not lean by any means, but hey, it's a freaking burger.I will say that I did really like the little high school football scoreboard on the wall. I appreciate the interest in community. The servers were really nice too and the fries were pretty good. The soda machines were also brand new and had lots of options... and all it was a very clean, nice little place.However... I still have a couple suggestions:-Add truffle fries. We have them at every decent burger place up here in Chicago (I'm a Champaign native though fyi) and I think it just legitimizes the fact that you're paying for more for "just a burger". Plus they're freaking delicious.- Add turkey burgers, or bison, or venison or something. A turkey burger is easy, and delicious, and leaner and I know I'd get it.

<Content> The only fast food choice you should even consider in Champaign. Nearly leaps into sit-down restaurant status. Quality ingredients and a wide variety of choices make this a destination heads and shoulders above the rest. The staff is always friendly and very helpful. John was a welcome smile for my late night drive-through purchase. He encouraged me to come back to try the milkshakes. I definitely will include that stop on my next Champaign trip.

<Content> Awesome food and service. I get the Cajun Sunrise burger most of the time! Also, order kid sized fries because regular may be a little too much for most people. The serving is still a lot for "kid-sized"However, it seems they get new people staffed every so often which slows down the speed of my order because they are training. But everyone else working there is so nice and friendly!All in all, I really love this joint!! I frequent it and leave satisfied every time.

<Content> I stopped by Meatheads one weekend and while I had fun, I wasn't blown away. I ordered a cajun, which was a solid meal for one. The burger came with egg + fresh jalepenos (delish) + cheese, etc. hold the bleu cheese sauce. Everything was nicely spiced and season, but the egg was a little overcooked and the patties were on the dry side. For ~$7/person, my sister and I had a solid OK meal.

<Content> I love this place. It's a bit provide than the average fast food burger joint, but the food is so much better. I'd argue that the food is better tasting than most sit-down burger places in C-U. Perhaps more importantly to someone as dorky as I am is that they regularly cycle their Chef-inspired burgers off the menu, but they'll still make them; as a result, I've literally been ordering from the "secret menu" for months. Ask for the Goulden with Cajun fries--you won't be disappointed!

<Content> The atmosphere and service are great. Very modern and clean inside, and the staff was helpful and nice. The food, however, like others have stated leaves something to be desired. When I pictured a meathead burger in my mind I expected a huge beef patty, and instead get something similar to a McDonald thin patty. The meat didnt really have much flavor, and the sandwich pretty much fell apart. I will say the ingredients were very fresh, and they give you a ton of fries. Easily could split a order between two people. The coke machines are pretty cool and was more memorable than the food. I'll give this place another try sometime, but for the price, it won't be a regular go-to place.

<Content> Yuck. Normally I like to try a place a couple times before writing a review but I will not be getting anything else from this place.My girlfriend's coworkers got take-out from here and she got a burger and a sandwich for me. Her burger had avocado, lettuce, and tomato. My sandwich was an ALT - avocado lettuce tomato on white bread. So there was similarity.When we got it, the paper around both sandwiches was soaked through in grease and translucent. This is not, in fact, necessarily a negative. I didn't get food from a burger place to eat healthy. I love seeing the grease on the wrapping paper from Derald's on their breakfast sandwiches.My sandwich was disappointing. It had enough avocado - once I could find it in the almost half cup of mayonnaise on the sandwich. The lettuce was iceberg lettuce and uninteresting. The tomato was okay. The bread was just white bread, fried in some kind of cheap vegetable oil. That made the sandwich much "heavier" and unpleasantly greasy. Like I said, I don't mind some grease, but this stuff tasted cheap and stale. After eating it, I felt kinda sick later in the day. My girlfriend's burger had much less avocado. The patties were extremely thin and bland. The bun wasn't great either. For all they talk about fresh ingredients on the website, I am not seeing the quality reflected in the food.The prices aren't cheap, either - $5 and up even for veggie sandwiches and up to $10 for burgers. Fries are extra - so we didn't get any, but I hadn't heard good things about them. Compare this to Black Dog, where you get an awesome burger and fries or other side for $8. Or Derald's, where the burgers are much cheaper and the veggies look more freshly sliced. If you must eat at a chain, try Culver's, even that's a much better deal, I think.Since we got take-out I can't comment on the restaurant itself. I would still never get food from them again.Edit: a note on this review. After it had been up for a little while, I was contacted via Yelp message by someone from Meatheads. They apologized profusely for my dissatisfaction and offered me a complementary meal in the future. I haven't taken them up on it - I'm still not in a huge hurry to go back - but they are trying to address unhappy reviews, and I think that's worth noting.

<Content> My boyfriend and I were having a craving for burgers and decided to give Meatheads a try as opposed to going to our regular bar for burgers. We regretted it as soon as we took the first bite.The burger here was greatly unimpressive and meat itself was mostly tasteless. I like it when I have a rich beefy taste to the burger patty, but this one did not have a trace of it. (so much for advertising the beef ... ) The burger was dripping with grease and it soaked the bun with the grease which made it soggy. Needless to say, eating became a messy ordeal. For two burgers, drinks, and fries (regular and cajun) we spent nearly $22!!! I was thinking this was gonna be the best burgers I've had, but it was a huge let down.I'm not coming back for sure. Much too expensive, burgers AND fries were subpar. Even if it was cheap, I would pay more for something that actually tastes good. At least the people were nice. Decor was very modern and clean. Oh and they had the new coke machines. But those things wouldn't be any reason why I would come again.

<Content> I saw this place at 10am in the morning while I was on my way to Charleston, IL and made a small footnote to stop in on the way back. I pulled in around 2:45pm and the place had a good crowd in it. I have a fondness and a weakness for a good burger...must...stop...in!The place was clean, the staff was professional and patient while I ordered. I went with the 1/2 pound Meathead, Cheddar, Mayo, Ketchup, Mustard, Lettuce, Tomato and Applewood Smoked Bacon. Hey its not fancy but I like the combination. I ordered a large order of fries and was warned, I went with the small. I also ordered a vanilla shake, I'm out of town I miss my girls and needed to eat my pain.I forgot to order my burger medium, what I got was absolute perfection. The burger was like cotton candy, it melted in your mouth. The river of fries were at the height of crispy perfection and the 'nilla shake, wooh!Over 11 hours later, I haven't been able to eat another thing, just not hungry, that was a good burger, as good as it gets! 'Nuff Said!

<Content> My wife and I went to Meatheads for the first time this evening. They did a great job remodeling the building. However...Our order was taken promptly, we were seated promptly although the tables were really close together and we felt like we were setting with six other people at our table. Even though the good folks setting on either side of us were pleasant and courteous, the seating did not make for a comfortable dining experience.I had a third pound meathead burger with all the fixings, a regular fry and drink. Our order was ready in supersonic record setting time and was brought to our table by a server. The burger was tasty and I really enjoyed the fresh cut fries. However...I understand turnover is important, especially on a busy Saturday night, and management wants to push as many people through the line as possible, but be reasonable. I have never felt so rushed or pushed to finish my meal as I was tonight at Meatheads. It was ridiculous! I barely got my last fry into my mouth before someone was hovering over me wanting to clear the table (and have me leave). Maybe it would be different say at 3:00 on a Tuesday afternoon. Maybe someday I'll find, or maybe not.

<Content> We've eaten here probably a dozen times in the last six months, and every single time the experience has been perfect.We typically order the "chef-inspired" burgers (Californian, Hawaiian, Reuben, etc.). We've tried them all, and they're all great. I've eaten burgers at a lot of places in CU and I'd say Meatheads ties with Crane Alley for my favorite burgers. (I even like them better than, e.g. Seven Saints, Destihl, and other high end places.) Crane Alley has fancier ingredients, but the quality is at the same high level at both places. I think that's very impressive for fast food.The other meals are good too. My daughter loves the chicken tenders, which are crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, unlike the dry chewy stuff you get at many fast food places. She also loves the hot dog, which is a real footlong.The fries are really, really good. And this is surprising considering they make them from fresh potatoes. Most places that I have been to that make fresh-cut fries (including, e.g. Five Guys) make a soggy, greasy mess that tastes like raw potatoes. Meatheads makes a hot, crispy pile of deliciousness that is really hard to beat. And with the cajun seasoning on them they are my favorite fries in town. FWIW they will also put things on them (bacon, cheese, etc.) if you want.The management at Meatheads is superb. Whenever we go at a busy meal time when the place is packed, the manager is always out on the floor watching *everything* and picking up the slack wherever it's necessary. This is exactly what a manager should be doing, but it is so rare in fast food that it is actually a pleasure to watch him and his employees do their jobs. It's like watching a well-oiled machine.Cooking is my hobby. I love fancy food. But this place is my guilty pleasure. I never thought I'd say this about a fast food restaurant, but to be honest it is my favorite American restaurant in town.

<Content> The burgers are definitely a cut above. They are comparable in price to the nice burgers in town at the Courier, Esquire, Crane Alley, etc. ($4-$7, depending on what you order). My husband still thinks that the Courier has the best burgers, but Meatheads blew the competition away for me. You get a larger portion of excellent tasting beef for the price. Every burger has at least two patties. Nearly everything about my regular meathead burger was perfect. The only room for improvement is the bun...but it wasn't bad at all--just not as gourmet as the rest of the burger. They have lots of fancy options. My husband really liked his Cajun Burger (although it was pretty messy to eat!) The fries are fresh, cut thin with skins on, and also served in large quantities. I have yet to try the shakes because Custard Cup is right down the street...The ambiance is casual and clean--a wide variety of songs played, not too loudly. There's plenty of seating and room to spread out, although I have seen it get pretty packed. This would be a great place to come with a big group because you could easily push tables together. They give you a number so that you can sit down after ordering and wait for a server to bring your food. The food comes very quickly. They also have the world's most high tech soda machine, with a touch screen menu of more than your average options. There's a drive through as well.Obviously eating here costs more than a fast food place would, but it tastes so much better. You're not eating pink slime, chemicals, fillers, or trans-fats, and it's obvious. It's still cheaper than eating out at a "sit-down restaurant." Tonight, my husband and I spent $16 for a filling meal for two and didn't have to tip anyone. When I'm in the mood for a burger at a casual place, this is where I will go.

<Content> Well, I went back to Meatheads with intentions to give it a second try. I figured this time I'd try an Oreo milkshake and a specialty burger, while sticking with the Cajun Fries. In all, this experience was much better than the first. The specialty burgers are the way to go, and the Oreo Milkshake was better than the Chocolate milkshake I got on my first try of Meatheads. I will be going back, but it's still a bit pricey to be my main choice of restaurant. Still, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good burger.Also, this time I noticed how involved Meatheads was with the community. They had a wall devoted to the sports for the high school's in the area. I thought that was a great idea. Just a side note.

The burgers are waaaaay overpriced, the fries are vastly medial, the meat is over-cooked, and the patties are about the size of something you'd get at Mickey D's...

<Content> I brought my husband to Meatheads for lunch on his birthday. He was super excited so we "splurged". He ordered a "Build Your own Burger": half pound burger (which is actually 3 small patties stacked) and a fried egg on top w/ swiss cheese. He loved it. We had the Chili Cheese Fries and they were delicious. I think the previous reveiwers who had Take Out...maybe didn't get the full experience like you do with dining in....because I would rank the Chili Cheese Fries at top of my list. I had the Texas Ranch burger and enjoyed every bite. We also had a Mocha Shake which was very rich and delicious, though my husband thought is was very "coffee" flavored (um, that's the point I thought but was happy to drink more of his share).Oh, and I love the fancy soda dispensers ...they are the electric ones where you can choose a flavor to go with your soda choice...totally fun.

<Content> I went there craving a burger but because I wanted something fast. I opted for the chili cheese fries to go. Something told me that I wasn't a good idea to take that on the road...The place looks super fab. It was very clean, earthy, and urban and not some hole in the ground. When I got my order, I got a heaping order of fries. They were separate from the chili, cheese, onions, and jalepeno peppers which were in small containers. They're not McDonalds kinds, more like Five Guys (with the skin on it), which I am not a fan of. Alone, the fries were bland and underwhelming. They were also not super fresh. The cheese sauce was okay (I was expecting something similar to nacho cheese), and the chili was actually pretty good, though, given the amount of fries I had, I was surprised at how little I got.It's definitely not something that I would order again, though I'd love to try a burger there.

<Content> Meatheads is okay, but to me it's an attempt to be Five Guys, and with one in C-U now, it's no longer high on my list of places to go.First the good: the burgers are amazing. They give Five Guys (heck, a lot of the bars) a run for their money, and in terms of "fast food" type joints, I've only had one or two better. The soda machine with the unlimited options is always cool (though I don't recommend the Peach Mello Yello Zero, both because it's not as good as it sounds and it probably shortens your lifespan by five years). Plus the decor is neat- I like that they list local sports scores on the wall, and the place is bright.The problem is that the place is so darn expensive. It's normally $12-$15 for a burger, fries and a drink, and while you get a lot of fries, they're the shoestring ones, so you don't get as many as you think. It also takes a bit of time for a pseudo-fast food restaurant, and while the toppings selection is diverse, it's not like it's super-diverse.

<Content> I made good on my promise to give Meatheads another try, and I did my best to leave my last experience at the door and give the restaurant a fresh start. At this point, Meatheads has been open in Champaign for over a year and a half, so I expect most of their kinks have been worked out, and my experience is fairly standard. I'm still not impressed. Sorry, Meatheads. I wanted to like you. This time, I ate in the restaurant. It was a Thursday, shortly after noon. The restaurant was busy-ish; not packed, ample seating options, but doing some good business. I ordered a similar burger to my first - a cheeseburger with fresh avocado, and I split an order of fries with Husband. I also got a soft drink, because they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle machines. I have a soft spot for those machines. I don't drink a lot of soda, but there's something that appeals to the kid in me when I can make a strawberry Sprite! ANYWAY.Pros - Customer service while ordering. The cashier was friendly, efficient, and got my order right. Drinks - Again, love those Freestyle machines. Way to go.Mehs - Fries. I didn't not like my fries. I also wasn't blown away. They were fine.Cons - The burgers are just *too* greasy. I'm sorry. Maybe some people like that, but I don't appreciate an active stream of grease dribbling off of my sandwich. The bottom bun was soaked with grease before I even had a chance to take a bite. The burgers just aren't up my alley.Price - The burgers aren't very big considering the price. I still think it's a little steep for what you get, especially compared to some of the other burger options in town.Customer service while eating - There were at least three staff members making regular rounds. This is good - if you need something. I don't like the feeling, however, of being rushed, and as soon as anyone picked up the last fry/burger bit/etc from their tray, a staff member would swoop down, ask a hurried "Areyoufinished" and grab the plate. This unnerves me. Also, Husband wanted to use his burger plate for a ketchup rest for his portion of the fries, but as the staff member had already grabbed his plate, he let it go. Is this a huge deal? No. Is it kind of.. rude? I felt so. I appreciate that the staff is trying to be helpful, but the constant circling is off-putting.I realize I may be picky, so I encourage anyone who is curious to give Meatheads a try. I did ask, again, for my dining companions' opinions, and they also weren't very impressed. Husband had been with me before, but we were dining with a friend who had never gone - in fact, it was his desire to try Meatheads that convinced us to go back and give it another try. None of us are planning a return trip. YMMV.

The fact that you can get specialty burgers like the bacon ranch or the rueben gives this place a solid advantage over the competion, the cajun fries are better than five guys.

<Content> Meathead's is a dependable burger spot that comfortably sits in between the upper end fast food of Wendy's and the local sit down offerings of Farren's, etc. While the patty itself is not quite as good as Five Guy's, the topping options put Meathead's ahead, in my opinion. I love the Texas Ranch burger (bacon, cheddar, BBQ), and the option to add a fried egg with the Cajun Sunrise is top notch! Also, the awesome soda machine and delicious chipotle flavored ketchup are fantastic additions! My only complaints are that sometimes my burger is a touch too greasy, and the cost is maybe $1 or so more than I would think appropriate. But never enough to prevent me from looking forward to my next visit!

<Content> I have gone here a few times. I find the burgers tasty and I am glad you can customize. The price is a bit high after adding fries and a drink. The drink machines are cool and the cajun fries are very tasty. The atmosphere is very clean and modern. I also like that they have a drive thru which takes about the same amount of time as sitting in the Steak and Shake drive thru. When I am craving a burger and don't want to go to a sit down place then I will probably go here.

<Content> Brought the burger-loving boy here the day after Meatheads opened to check it out. It was packed, but we received friendly greetings from the staff (GM and owner(s)? were there). The restaurant has counter service, where you order your burgers and then go to your table while everything is made to order. We each got 1/3 lb meatheads (there is also a 1/2 lb and kid's option) and a large fries to share. There are many premium toppings available to add to your burger for free (roasted red peppers, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, sauerkraut), while cheese, bacon, avocado, and fried egg (!) cost a little bit extra. I got a handful of standard toppings, and the boy got everything. Our food came out in ~5-6 minutes. The fries were fantastic, crispy with the skins left on. A large ($3) is enough to feed two hungry fry-loving grad students. A sign says that these are cut fresh daily... filling the C-U void for decent potato fare. As far as the burgers go, I quite liked that I could taste the beef through the toppings. The burger ($4.50 + $1 for cheese) was greasy to hold (on the outside of the bun and also dripping from the burger itself), but everything tasted clean and I didn't feel like I had been salt bombed afterward. The bun was soft and sturdy.. appropriate for the type of toppings offered. My burger did not go slip sliding away. Meatheads also offers several dipping sauces (for fries or to be added on to burgers), handspun milkshakes, and two freestyle coke machines. The food is satisfying and tasty (craveable? perhaps), the location is clean and bright, and the people are friendly. Welcome to the neighborhood!

<Content> Not bad. Got the 1/3 Texas something or another burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato and grilled onions. Portions were huge, swimming in grease. The fries were alright, but not the best; crispy, but not too much potato. The white bread buns were cold; with all the other toppings the texture clashed with the grilled burger and crispy toppings.  I wished they would toast the bun slightly to make it fit."It's basically an okay Five Guys" says my friend. It isn't the best burger around. I was hoping for better meat, and a big honking patty over two stacked slim slices of meat.  I gave it three since 11 dollars for the full meal is a lot for just an alright burger. I will try it again, and recommend it to anyone who wants to try that "upscale" burger joint.

<Content> I can't really say anything bad about the restaurant experience, other than to note the menu is very, very limited, if you don't want a burger ... But then again, the name of the restaurant is Meatheads ... Also a very sterile environment, and very loud, with lots of hard surfaces reflecting every sound.More significantly, the burger was a major disappointment! The best description would be GREAT selection of toppings on an extremely ordinary and virtually tasteless hamburger patty, and a Wonderbread bun. I mean, the bun was really disappointing ... My girlfriend and I each had a burger - no fries and no drinks - and it came to $12. With fries and drinks it would have been $20. Seriously, I would have been more satisfied with a McDonalds or Burger King hamburger - maybe not so fancy but half the price ...Honestly, I would never go out of my way to return to this restaurant, and anybody who recommends the burgers at this restaurant as anything more than mediocre has really questionable taste in food ... IMHO.

<Content> As most other people have mentioned, Meatheads takes after the Five Guys burger model. Didn't try the fries, but I enjoyed the Cajun Sunrise burger, though I might recommend it without Jalepenos, as it overwhelmed the taste of the burger.It's a little pricey, and there are definitely better burgers out there, but not bad.I would give this place a 3.5 but I'll round up due to balance out some of the strange negative reviews about the menu and greasy food. Yes, they have only burgers, and yes, burgers are often greasy.

<Content> I went again and my experience was much better the second time around. This time I decided to try one of the recommended burgers (I think they were called Chef Inspired) instead of building my own. I had the Hawaiian - Pineapple, Jalapenos, cheese, and bbq sauce I think. It was much better - my burger was a lot less greasy, and it stayed together quite well. I got the Cajun fries again, those were pretty good as well. I went again with a large group (7 people) and the staff saved a table for us while we were in line. That was awesome, since it was pretty crowded on a Saturday night.Pros: Tasty burger. A large fry is plenty for 2 people to split. Not overloaded on cajun flavor. Staff was excellent again. I didn't get a milkshake, but they looked kinda expensive for the size (but supposedly they taste pretty good).Cons: Fries were alright. I had a lot of little pieces in the order I split with a friend.Overall I had a much better second experience at Meatheads. I would recommend that you try one of the chef inspired burgers! I can say that I will come back here again.

<Content> I ate at Meathead's twice. The first time I ordered a burger, fries, and a drink. The total was about $9, so I expected a burger and fries for two, and the portion was huge. It looked really good, with fries overflowing the basket. The burger looked great...until I took a bite. I waited for some flavor, but it never came. On to the fries. Fresh cut, looking good...but tasted burnt. I was sitting close to a couple who I overheard discussing the food, and their thoughts were the same. The burger was tasteless. On my second visit, I ordered a Chicago Dog and fries. The dog was a footlong, but it also didn't have the snap or the meat flavor I expect in a Dog named Chicago. The fries were the same, huge portion, burnt tasting.C'mon, Meathead's, man up. What's with your beef? It's can't be that hard to buy beef worth the prices you charge. When I occasionally eat at Mac's, I get a double with nothing on it, and even at Mac's, the beef flavor shines through. Five Guys will be here soon, and I'm hopeful we'll have a great burger in town. But I'm not counting on it. "Under promise, and over deliver." I think with franchise prices what they are, corners are often cut.

<Content> Ok, I have to admit, I really wanted to like this place. This whole "upscale burger joint" concept is really growing right now and I kinda dig the idea. I've been here on three occasions, hoping that I was just missing something. Unfortunately, It's just not that good. As others have mentioned, the staff really seems to try and are friendly. The atmosphere is as expected. Sort of an industrial/modern atmosphere with lots of wood. It's a new facility, so it's clean and tidy in upkeep. Can't fault any of these items.But then there's the food. Burgers, fries, drinks and shakes. Pretty much that's it. There is a selection of theme burgers and a build-your-own option. First time I went I had the basic Cheeseburger. It came promptly in a basket with a pile of fries. The burger was covered in so many toppings that it was really just a topping sandwich flavored with meat. Everything was so greasy and sloppy that you really had to eat it with a knife and fork. Meh, not my thing. But I figured I'd give it one more chance and try a build-your-own next time. This wasn't much better. There's just no flavor to the burger and it's a sloppy mess to eat. I decided to splurge on a shake this time to take with me. By the time all was said and done, I was out darn near $15.00. Way too expensive for a burger and fries. Then, about two weeks ago, I was late to an appointment and needed a quick lunch. As I mentioned, I really wanted to like this place so I decided to swing in and give it one more try. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger this time. Even worse than the first two. Size and quality had dropped from the first two times, always a bad sign. Seems like they are starting to cut corners. Again, dropping $10 for lunch really isn't going to work. Culver's, on a good day, make a way better burger for quite a bit less.There are a couple new places with this theme opening in the next few months around town. Let's hope they are an improvement.

<Content> Who knew someone reads this stuff? After my last review I was contacted by Mr. Sanders from the home office marketing department (shouldn't he be marketing chicken?) he was very unhappy about the experience I had and in short he said he would get that taken care of. He later invited us to please give them a second chance. So on the 2 June we did and the staff and the cleanliness had not changed still top end. But the food, it did change for the better our burgers and fries and chicken sandwich were all cooked and put together very well. Unlike last time this time my burgers were juicy with nice flavor and had the toppings I ordered, the chicken was hot juicy and well seasoned, the fries hot and fresh still a little heavy on the salt for my taste but nothing like last time, we ate them all this time. Maybe I'll ask for them with no salt next time. Over all a big impovement and we will be going back, hope there is no backsliding. We went at similar times both trips about 3:30p.m. on a Sunday and a Saturday very slow both times so it did not get better or worse do to number of customers

<Content> I came in right at 11am, and there was no line.... but by the time I left about 15 minutes later, the place was filling up fast!  The burgers here are hand-formed which is a big plus for me and the fries are cut fresh -- another huge plus!!  I ordered a l'il meathead which is a single burger with lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, grilled onions and jalepenos! The jalepenos are super-fresh green.... not the kind that sit in brining liquid for years.  The lettuce was crisp, but a little yellow and everything was super fresh. You order at the front, they give you a number, you sit down, and then they bring you your food in about 5 minutes! They also have this crazy cool touch screen soda machine so you can have custom-made sodas like Fanta Grape/Pip/Sprite/Diet RootBeer or some other weird concoction.  Anyways, I ordered cajun fries which were super crisp and had just the right amount of kick! I have no complaints about this place so far!!!  Way better than Five Guys (I don't think I'll ever like their burgers and thank goodness they aren't in Champaign)! Meatheads is probably the best fast food burger in C-U, but not as good Farren's or Black Dog. I paid a little over $8 for a lil meathead, cajun fries and a drink!

<Content> I thought I had found my 5 Guys fix but was a bit disappointed. We ordered 2 cheese meatheads with a regular fry and a vanilla milkshake. It was definitely a step up from the typical fast food chain but lacked the addicting lure of 5 Guys. Maybe we just got a bad batch but I wouldn't order the fries again. They appeared to be shoe string size but the only ones that were crispy were the really small fries. The drink machine was cool but no Birch Beer! Pricing was similar to 5G's but MH gives 10% back to the community! Decor and staff were excellent.

<Content> Lame. Doesn't hold a candle to Five Guys. Burgers were greasy and buns were stale. The produce on the burgers wasn't great either. Fries were lame. Just a very average burger if you ask me.

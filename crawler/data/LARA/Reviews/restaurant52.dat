<Content> I have not been to a KFC in years. However, I saw an ad on TV about the 395 calorie meal for $3.95 so I thought I would try it. No good deal here. This is only offered in dark meat not white meat. Since I don't like dark meat I paid the extra $2.00 for white meat. How do they get such small breast and wing pieces? Are they using baby chickens? Not only were the pieces small but they were very dry, tough and cold. It was awful! I will not go to KFC again!The green beans and potatoes were good so at least part of the meal was eatable.

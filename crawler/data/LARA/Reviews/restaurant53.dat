<Content> We've been to Boomerangs on several occasions now. Their wing night on Wednesdays can't be beat. Their sauces are really good. I actually prefer a lot of their sauces over that big-chain wing place (which I won't name). The wings are really big and only 33 cents. I like that you can get as many of any flavor as your want without an extra charge. My favorite sauces are the jerk and tequila lime.Their sides and burgers are really good, too. {EDIT} We went to wing night again last night and got onion rings. I can't think of anyplace that has better onion rings. They're not frozen, obviously hand-dipped. They even give you the fried crumblies. Holy moly, they were so good. Nice staff, nice place. I like going here because it has a neighborhood bar feeling.

<Content> 30 minutes is just too long to wait for wings and it still didn't look like my order was coming so no thanks.

<Content> There is absolutely nothing wrong with this place. Seemingly not a ringing endorsement, but when you take into account the surroundings of this joint, you will recognize that the mere fact that this place doesnt suck means that it is A-OK. Confused? Don't be. This place looks like an absolute murder-me-in-the-bathroom-and-serve-me-as-patty-melts-next-Tuesday shithole. Its not. Its a moderately divey outdated (vintage 1986 decor, probably ironic in hipsters' eyes) bar and grill. High points include a pretty new version of Golden Tee, a juke box, a friendly guy slinging drinks, and most rewarding: a fully integrated theme of boomerangs. I wont be a spoiler, but you will love pointing out all the boomerangs, like its Highlights magazine. They have domestic macros on tap, a full liquor selection and daily lunch and dinner specials. I'll probably go back for the Friday night fish fry.Bottom line: don't let the fact that it is next to a strip joint and bumps up to a pretty questionable area chase you away. If you are a diver, dive in.

<Content> My parents were in town and mom wanted to watch the MSU basketball playoff game. We needed somewhere close, cheap, unpretentious where my middle-age 'rents wouldn't feel too out of place.Yay, Boomerangs! Despite the fact of Friday evening, the place seemed slow. Might get busy later?  I love the cheap drinks here, and plan on trying food here sometime. When I'm less terrified of bar burgers due to the Iron Post Food Poisoning Incident.From the shot list, Pineapple Upside Down Cake kicks serious ass. I ended up getting three of 'em and sharing round my group. The bartender here was super friendly and very attentive.

We had some fresh cut french fries and fired mushrooms, the mushrooms were great!everyday they have a special, and it appears they have a new menu with famous Illinoisans assigned to each sandwich.pitchers of domestic draft beer was $5.

<Content> Live music, rockin' service, cheap drinks, and a great grill. Drew, the line cook is the most outgoing friendly dude you'd ever meet. They had the coolest float in the Labor Day parade which makes this the place to be in all of Urbana. (Not an ugly one in the bunch). Pool tables, video gambling and the area's only 0.33 wing night on Wednesdays.

<Content> A great neighborhood bar under new ownership since 2011 with a handful of regular, and mostly pleasant drinkers. It caters to bikers as well as family plus has a decent- sized outdoor lounge. Food specials daily but Fish Fridays serve up the largest and best cod sandwichs in C-U hands down! Always clean, fun, and comfortable for what looks like a dive bar next to a strip club. Actually was built in a self serve car wash structure. With the new owners the place now rocks out with live bands. Check it out cause you won't be disappointed.

<Content> This Subway is the closest to my work so I go here when I want a quick sandwich. The last few times I have gone there have been big over sized work trucks parked in the parking lot. The lot at this location is way too small and it's hard to maneuver around the vehicles. I parked in the very last spot so no one would block me in and sure enough one of those over sized work trucks parked next to me in a no parking area. I had to wait until he was done with his sandwich before I could leave. I will avoid this Subway until they get this problem resolved.

<Content> This is the worst Subway in Champaign-Urbana! Filthy, and the staff was bitching about the fact that he had to sweep the floor! I'll never be back, too many other options in town and close to this location. Ewwwwwwww!

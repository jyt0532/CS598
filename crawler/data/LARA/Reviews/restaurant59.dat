<Content> Yes, I can now understand why Sbarro filed for bankruptcy earlier this year: their food sucks. Not only is it low quality pizza, it's also very costly. Even with a coupon, I paid $3.00 for just a slice of pizza. They don't even have the prices for a slice of normal cheese or pepperoni pizza on their menu (they also don't have take home menus); almost as if they're ashamed they're charging exorbitant prices for basic slices of pizza.

<Content> Worst meal ever. I made a yelp account just to give this place a bad review. The baked ziti had several hard pasta pieces inside. They were either under cooked or left out for too long. My slice of pepperoni pizza was slightly chewy and the cheese was slipping off after a few bites. Please get this Sbarro off my campus.

<Content> Delicious! This is the best gyro place in the C-U and the best gyro place ever. The quality of the food is amazing. The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable.

<Content> What the heck? Did I go to a fake Niro's Gyros? My experience was trash compared to the rest of the yelpers here.They had 2 burgers and fries for $5.99 on special. I thought I ordered that and even tried to point at the marker board to the woman taking my order, who clearly looked as if English was not her primary language. I also ordered 1 single gyro. It came out to $15.What I actually got was 2 burgers, a single gyro but no fries. I would have went back but didn't realize it until I was already home. I could have sworn I said "THE TWO BURGERS AND FRIES". Even after my order was taken I thought I heard her shout my complete, correct order to the cook. No receipt was given so who knows if it was right at all?Anyway, the burgers were most certainly not worth $3 each, they were mostly bread and only come with 2 pickles, ketchup and mustard. Cheese is also $0.50 per burger, and honestly was comparable in taste to a McDonald's "burger", if you even want to call that garbage a burger at all.Next was the gyro which I was hoping was going to be at least a little better than the burgers; it wasn't. Yes, it was a large portion of gyro meat but quantity does not make up for quality, for me. At nearly $6, this monstrosity was way too greasy. I know gyros are a greasy food, but this was excessive. The paper it was wrapped in was soaked and I had to pick it off in pieces. The grease content was similar to a $4, 1lb burrito you get in the bad neighborhoods of Chicago. Regardless, the two slices of tomato were fairly large but there were hardly any onions on it at all, maybe 2 small O slices, but I'm doubtful either of them were fresh. The tzatziki sauce was hard to taste from being drowned out by all the grease, making it more of a watery, greasy mess. I didn't care for this gyro at all, the only thing going for it was the quantity of meat. However, my local beef stand back in the suburbs has a gyro that isn't half as greasy and in my opinion is much better. Oh, did I mention it costs $2 less?I had high expectations for Niro's but my order was not correct, I got less food than I paid for and the food I got was poor, at best. Yes, the place was busy and maybe it was an honest mistake, but I spent $15, which can get you a lot of other [better] things in Champaign-Urbana that might actually include a drink, or perhaps a correct order.Sorry guys! 1 star for portions, if that.....P.S. I thought the gyro at Zorba's was MUCH better than Niro'!

<Content> The food is great. The delivery drivers are nice. Whoever answers the phone will bitch you out though. I had a simple question and she treated me like I was stupid. I get that customer service sucks, but at least act like you like your job. I don't think I'll be ordering from them again. I don't support people who employ assholes.

<Content> These are some great gyros. The best time to come is in between 11:00am and 3:00pm when they have their specials. Every day, they have a special where you can get gyro and fries or Italian beef and fries for $6.19 (drinks not included). Here's a list of all their daily specials (which do include drinks): Monday: Italian beef meal $5.99Tuesday: Gyro meal $5.99 Wednesday: Chicken breast meal $5.09Thursday: Phili steak meal $6.09 Friday: Cod fish meal $5.09Saturday: Grilled chicken pita meal $6.29

<Content> I used to get Gyro burger and pound of gyro meat from these guys. Very friendly and the food is also excellent. The pound of gyro meat is super cool considering its only $7.

<Content> The gyros here are def the best in town, hands down. Nice flavor, not dry with the perfect grease level. Fries are best here if you ask for them well done, they get crispier. Just as good are the Italian beef sammies. Dear gob, get them dipped in au jus and inhale 'em quick while the bread turns into a somehow delightful sogginess. Urbana side of town is take-away and drive-thru only.

<Content> I was going to Zorba's to have gyros until I explored this place, and I'm regretful about the time which I wasted in Zorba's.Niro's Gyros (on University Ave.) is a great place to have gyros. Fast and delicious!!! Also cheap. You pay less than 8$ for a value meal. Also, they have a deal when you get 2 gyro sandwiches, you can get 1 free!!!Only disadvantage of the place is that they have no indoor area, because they work like a take-away.Anyhow, this is the best gyros place in C-U area.

<Content> This is Greek food as I know it. The kind that makes paper translucent, takes the edge off an upcoming hangover, and makes you feel crappy and satisfied simultaneously. It's abundant in Chicago, but this is the best place in Chambana for a really greasy gyro.They have the requisite gyros and Chicago hot dogs here, but I recommend the equally staple pizza puff and the OMFG-YES gyro burger. Think of a quarter pound cheeseburger with layers of gyro meat strips on it...makes me want to pound a few and take a cab all the way to Urbana.Oh, and the Urbana location is the original and a lot smaller than the Champaign one. If you want your food quickly (or via drive-through) and want to avoid a mass of drunks late at night, go here.

<Content> Tasty!It looked like a good gyro should look, had the requisite onions and tomatoes and tzatziki sauce. I ordered extra sauce, and for a nominal fee, was given a HUGE portion (awesome). The fries were fine, and the price was right on par for a gyro combo meal.As far as taste goes it was pretty right on, but the tzatziki could have used a touch more garlic, because I don't still taste it every time I burp...Gross, I know, but, c'mon, you know what I mean.

<Content> Zorba's made me skeptical of gyros in Champaign-Urbana, and then I tried Niro's. The gyros are delicious! Here's a tip: if you're getting more than one gyro, go for the double or triple gyro plate rather than getting individual gyros. The prices are pretty similar, but you get fries, more sauce, and more meat. You have to assemble the gyro yourself then, but that way you can get the perfect sauce to meat ratio. The meat is really greasy, so I usually blot away as much as I can with a napkin or two. That's eating healthy, right?The fries are also pretty good, and I don't like fries all that much. The cheese fries are awesome, but it's just a cup of cheese with an order of fries. If you pay a bit more for the chili cheese fries, you get a ton more fries and cheese, plus chili. It would be nice if the order of cheese fries was as large!I haven't really tried anything else on the menu. My boyfriend has tried more and liked it all. Take his word for it, if you want, or just stick with the greasy, but oh so good gyros.

<Content> I don't usually review chains, but since this is the only place in Champana you can get a descent gyros, I'll make an exception.Their gyros aren't amazing or anything, but will definitely quench that gyros craving. Yes, they are greasy, but all good gyros are -- I like mine with giardiniera. However, it is important to mention that I've had their Italian beef before and it was crappy! I'll definitely be back to Niro's whenever I'm in the mood for a greasy gyros.

<Content> I have only had one experience from here. Ordered a gyro-cheeseburger as I was looking for something of the sort--fat & greasy. Read a lot of reviews and in the past I was real fond of gyros and have tried Zorba's & Geovantis. Geovantis's gyros being the better of those two. It was rather tasty, nothing spectacular though. Very fulfilling. However, the fries were extra greasy and looked like they had been fried in really old grease, tasted like it too.I would definitely say its worth a try if you're hungry and in the mood for such a meal. I am pretty sure their gyros are delicious.

<Content> I gave 5 stars because:1. It has great Gyro. I used to go to Zorba's for Gyros, but I think this Niro's does a better job.2. The have a deal for a free Gyro with the purchase of two Gyro meals. 3. Did I mention the Gyro is awesome?!4. They are open pretty late in the night. That singlehandedly deserves one star! It's close to my lab, so it's a savior for late night work.5. The people working there are friendly, and fellow students. Oh, and the Gyro is tasty!

<Content> One of the few halal places in Champaign. I have only ever tried three of their items. Gyros, cheesburgers and gyro burger. Cheeseburgers are mediocre but everything else is good. My only complain is the place is too small. Not much space inside to relax and eat. Also the fact that even water costs money is ridiculous.

<Content> We just ate gyros from here the other day and they were SO UNBELIEVABLY SALTY. As always, the mozzarella sticks tasted like cleaning detergent... but I wouldn't ask it any other way. I love Nyro's, and besides, the salt lick flavor can always be hidden by the most delicious cucumber yogurt sauce. Oh yes, come to me, gyro.

<Content> This is the best gyro place in town, and one of the better meal values as well. After 4PM there's a buy 2, get 3 deal on the gyros, which equates to dinner for you and a friend with either a snack for you when you get home at drunk-thirty, or when you wake up.

<Content> It has a large array of foods to choose from, so if you don't want a gyro that day, you can find something else. The fries are ok -- they used to serve a lot more than they do now -- but opt for the onion rings.

<Content> I used to love this place as a student, and looked forward to my visits when I was back in town, but on my recent trip I was somewhat disappointed. The quality and taste were down significantly from what i had been accustomed to. Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, so if I try it again and it's back to its old form I'll update this.

<Content> Qdoba recently made it s return to the campus. This time its located in the basement of the union where that sushi restaurant used to be. Unfortunately, Qdoba continues to dissapoint. Its prices are shockingly high, 7.40 for a chicken bowl or 8.50 for a steak bowl. For such a price you'd expect quality food, but instead its like eating a less fresh and less flavorful Chipotle. Considering that chipotle isnt known for being very flavorful, you can use your imagination about how good qdoba's food is. Luckily, there was no line at qdoba when I went today, whereas chipotle almost always has a line. If you're in a rush and craving pseudo mexican food, then this might be acceptable, otherwise I'd recommend going to Maize or, at worst, Chipotle.

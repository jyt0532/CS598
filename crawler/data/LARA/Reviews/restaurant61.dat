<Content> The Good:SO and I both ordered Unagi bowls. The unagi itself was good, and that's the only reason I gave this two stars instead of one. The Bad:The veggies served with it were not great, and it did not come with miso soup, unlike all of their other "bowls". Also, it took an extremely long time to receive our relatively simple meals, around fifteen-twenty minutes. This was because he completely forgot about us and only remembered when my SO went up and to ask about the food. Moreover, he and I watched as the worker (probably also the manager) argued with a customer, saying that she had already received her food, when it was clear it was a different girl who happened to order the same item. Overall, would not return, especially with Sushi Ichiban so close, and with more reasonable prices.

<Content> Health nuts (and those looking for lighter fare) will love that the food is free of heavy seasonings. But the portions are tiny and, my God, is the service here slow and rude. Perhaps that's why Sushi San, despite occupying one of the most visible spots in the food court, attracts hardly any customers even during peak hours. Once I asked for rice and vegetables in separate containers (as opposed to one on top of the other in a cramped bowl, making it impossible to enjoy the two together). The server flatout refused without even a trivial apology.

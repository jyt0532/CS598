<Content> With no visible signs or advertising, you could easily overlook this place during your entire stint at the university. (By the way, you can find it on the second floor, northwestern corner of the Union.) I would recommend this place for guests of the Union Hotel who want to stick close to their rooms, or anyone else who wants a slightly classier lunch option (compared to the mall-style food court in the Union's basement). My department often takes visiting professors and job candidates here for lunch, mostly because it is no fuss yet still feels professional. Although there are no actual restrictions against the public dining here, the location and atmosphere make it a more appropriate lunch option for the university community and campus visitors. Food is served buffet-style, with daily soups, salad bar, sandwich bar, hot bar, and desserts. In terms of quality, I'm pretty sure that the Ballroom uses the same food service company as the campus dining halls. There's a good selection of crunchy veggies on the salad bar, meats and cheeses for sandwiches, and other items, but I can't help but feel that I'm reliving a slightly upscale version of my dorm years. The hot bar is surprisingly good, and probably the only part of the menu that sees significant rotation (I've never seen the same thing on the hot bar twice in a month). This can be great if you plan to eat here regularly and don't like repetition; it sucks once you've found something you really like and know there's a slim chance of seeing it again. Some of the past items I've really enjoyed include: chicken piccata, eggplant parmesan, and potato-crusted fried fish. There is usually a vegetarian entree and sides, and the staff are good at answering questions if you have dietary restrictions.Time has passed since Yelpers wrote about this place, and the price has rose to around $10 per person. This price includes access to the full buffet, plus beverages, and I think it is comparable to what you'd probably pay at other buffet places.

<Content> The ballroom, as the name suggests, provides a grand atmosphere for lunch. But the food is done by University Dining Services -- the same people that cater meetings and events so badly. The motto could be: "A dorm dining hall without the dorm."The one joy of the buffet line for me is its Midwestern-ness. I occasionally see jello salads and ambrosia unlike anything I have ever seen on the West Coast. Miniature marshmallows!  Fruit salad with... is that mayonnaise? The salad and dessert recipes recall the Better Homes cookbook circa 1952. But beyond these culture shocks there is little pleasure to be found. It's expensive for the quality of the food. The salad bar is tolerable. The main dishes range from poor to horrible. The sandwich bar features limp lunchmeats and tasteless bread. If you like to snicker at such things, apparently the person who writes the buffet cards is often stumped by the exotic ingredients in some dishes. This leads to platters marked as "White Soup," "Spring Salad" or my favorite: "Ethnic Dish."Note that the previous price listed is out of date. It is now $8.75 for buffet, drink, and dessert.

<Content> I love this place...my sister first turned me onto it when we were both students in the 80's. first of all it's incredibly cheap, $7.95 for lunch, dessert, soda, and coffee. the students who work here are all on the work study program so you should definitely tip them well considering the food is so cheap and these kids can really use the dough.the architecture in here is awesome. mostly faculty staff are dining here so be prepared to see your professors if you are a student or your colleagues if you're a worker bee.the food is actually quite good. you can make a super salad with actual dark green leaves and some nice additives. they always have nice vegetarian options for entrees and soup as well.this is a great place to meet a group and really feel collegiate.

<Content> This was an o.k. place when it was around $7 a meal, students would stock up and make it their only meal of the day- ultimately filling the belly and saving a bit of cash.The only real saving grace for this place is that you can bill a departmental account. I highly suspect that's the primary reason we see Prof's and visitors here often. I personally apologize for the food when there with guests. The waiters aren't really waiters, but sort of "I'll get you your drink when I feel like it"-ers & "I'll just ignore this stack of used dishes while asking if you want coffee"-ers.The dishes remind me of school cafeteria food but from chefs who passed the next level up of culinary cafeteria school. I think I may have finished my salad. All else left me cold and wanting. Try to avoid if you can. (Unfortunately all my grad friends somehow think this is all a good deal for $10.)Seriously- can it be called a place to eat if they can't even serve a glass of coke with carbonation left? Do they pour them in the morning for the lunch hour?

<Content> Sure, this place is convenient, as it's located inside the student union right in the heart of the UIUC campus. Especially convenient for me since I work right across the street. But quite honestly, the food isn't that great at all. It's a buffet, all you can eat for a reasonable price (around $8 or $10? not too sure), but the food is no better than cafeteria food and overall quite mediocre. If anything, go to check out the giant ballroom that it's located in, but for the same price you can get better lunch fares a couple of blocks away on Green St. Meh...

<Content> This place is a little expensive when you consider the following: 1. The service is atrocious, 2. they stop making a lot of the food early. I like to go from time to time for London Broil, it tastes great. But if I arrive a little late (but still within the time that the place is open) I might not get the food I came for. They stop cooking the food eve though people have still paid to be there! The staff has been rude and slow for as long as I have been coming. It's embarrassing when you bring people from out of town (like visiting lecturers, etc).Three stars for good food, minus two stars for being lazy and rude.

<Content> If you ever feel the need for ill-prepared food in a funeral-home-esque atmosphere, this place is for you. The last time I was here it was when a visiting scholar was in town, so someone got the bright idea of bringing her here. We loaded up our plates with watery cottage cheese and wilted lettuce and sat down. The conversation kind of mimicked the food: bland and predictable. Maybe you'll have better luck, but man, I thought this was just about the worst place on campus to eat. (See my review for the Krannert cafe, which is at least do-able.)

<Content> Cactus Grill is a worthy substitute for Chipotle (I avoid campus if I can and the other location is out of the way). Their daily specials are a fair price and filling. I usually get the burritos in a bowl to save a little on carbs.I do wish their fish tacos/burritos used something like grilled salmon or tilapia, instead of Gorton's-type fried fish mystery meat.A big plus is they have Sriracha as a condiment! The Thai-Mexican twist makes me a happy camper!

<Content> I ordered the steak burrito today and placed my order at 11:08. 12:55 rolls around and still no food so I called the store to see what the holdup was. The guy on the other end says he'd get in touch with the delivery driver and see what was going on; this after telling me it should be 33 minutes because his driver was on my side of town. I hung up expecting that he'd call and give me a new more accurate time to expect my food but 1:10 comes without a call and at this point I'm ready to cancel my order unless they're willing to take off some of the price for the long wait. As I'm on the phone with him the second time my food finally came.  I shouldn't have tipped the driver but I did after he said that he'd gotten lost. On to the food itself. The flavor was good when I tasted it. Very unevenly distributed throughout my lukewarm meal in what should have been a satisfyingly large burrito. The rice was very bland in many parts and the sauce was a far cry from what I consider spicy. To be fair I grew up in Texas so they may have been catering to Midwestern spicy which isn't nearly spicy enough for a south/southwest pallet. For the $12 I paid after the tip, I should have gotten much better for my money. Oh and how they justify a $2 charge for delivery (which I found out after the driver was long gone) is beyond me. It's too bad because I really wanted to like this place. Maybe I'll have a better experience dining in but I might not have the stomach or wallet to give them a second chance. A free or largely discounted meal would go a long way in chalking this up to a fluke.

<Content> Mediocre mexican. Priced awesome if you get the special and it's only about $5 for lunch. There wasn't any flavor when I ordered a steak bowl. I prefer Pancheros or Chipotle over Cactus Grill.

<Content> Food wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the hour and a half delivery time I experienced. I placed my order just after 11AM (opening time) and it took way too long for a burrito and a quesadilla. Now this was the second chance I had given them. The first time, I ordered my food and they called me an hour later to tell me they had just received my order. I asked them to cancel my order instead. If you need food delivered, I do not recommend ordering here. No unless you want to be late to class because you were waiting for food to arrive.

<Content> Just ordered the steak burrito. I thought the meat was good but on the whole a very simple meal..nothing special. Decent delivery time and decent prices makes this a decent place to order from.

<Content> As someone who works in the Neil Street area, I am dismayed that most lunch times options are limited to typical restaurant chains. Luckily, I can count on Cactus Grill when I want a fast lunch that is less corporate than a McBurger.The quality of the food is near mediocre; some ingredients really shine, but others somehow always disappoint. Many of the meats (chicken, steak) are chewy and dry, though they're left to soak in their juices before service (doesn't help, unfortunately). For my meat option, I usually stick with the fish, which is deep-fried in a panko-like batter. The fish dishes also usually come with a drizzle of creamy chipotle sauce, yum.Recently I bought a burrito with cilantro-lime rice and black beans. The rice is an unmistakable (but poor) imitation of the rice from Chipotle, with cilantro that is never mixed in evenly. When I bit into the beans, I realized they were still...undercooked? I was pretty surprised by this discovery as most places use pre-made, canned beans rather than beans cooked in-store...so compliments to homemade beans, but disappointment at undercooked beans.Despite my criticisms, I still return to Cactus Grill every other week to pick up food. It's not luxury, but I don't expect too much from lunch on a weekday.

<Content> Not bad, but not impressive either. Too expensive unless you get the daily special. I'll stick to Maize next time.

<Content> I *really* wanted to at least add a star to my review of Cactus Grill on a return visit, but I'm very disappointed to say that I can't bring myself to do so.It happens to be very convenient to my work to go, so I decided to go on a day when burritos were the special of the day. Wednesday's special is Steak Burrito for $4.99, so I went with that, even though everyone who DOES like this place says that the Honey Grilled Chicken is the way to go.  Since I was getting the special, I decided to get a side of chips and salsa, thinking that just in case the burrito was terrible, at least I could snack on the chips.To their credit, the burrito was much better fare than my previous experience with the tacos. I got the cilantro rice and black beans, but the steak just does not have that much flavor.  I got the spicy green salsa, and this salsa does carry some heat with it when you have quite a bit of it at once. It had very little shredded cheese on it, which could have at least been a saving grace if there had been more -- they should think about going with a cheese sauce (ala Qdoba's Steak Queso burrito). Overall, it was food and probably a decent deal for the $5 special, but I wasn't impressed on taste.So...the chips.  These were not even close to the life preserver for which I was hoping. The chips were cold, HARD, and downright inedible. They were only barely salted, and honestly, I was afraid I might chip a tooth. I ate about 4, and that's all I could bear. I got the hot salsa with those as well, and even tried soaking them a bit, but I ended up throwing most of them away.I'm sorry to those who do enjoy Cactus Grill and can't understand why I'm down on them. Like I said before, I would like to see them succeed. There is a severe lack of variety for lunch on south Neil near my work, and this would be a nice location if the food was more up to par. I will give it one more shot with the chicken, just because i like burritos but refuse to fight the campus parking/traffic. If it improves significantly, I will post an update.

<Content> I really do dislike writing bad reviews for anything, but I feel this experience merits a warning. I just moved here from south Texas, was really craving Mexican food, and felt too lazy to go sit in a restaurant, so delivery it was. I ordered a cheese quesadilla (with onion and tomato for a sad attempt at pico de gallo), and chips and salsa.The quesadilla was incredibly greasy, the tomato chunks were quite large, and the onion was far too overpowering for my taste. The chips and salsa were another matter. The chips were edible, but they weren't my favorite. And warning with the salsa, if you order the spicy salsa, expect green salsa. I'm used to red, so the possibility of green didn't even cross my mind. I'm not a fan of green salsa, so my dislike is likely an artifact of my dislike of green salsa in general, not this specific salsa.Plus side? The food was delivered about half an hour earlier than estimated.Looking at the rest of the reviews, it doesn't appear that Cactus Grill is ALWAYS bad, so maybe mine was just a bad experience, but still...TL;DR: greasy quesadilla, hard chips, green salsa, searching for another Mexican restaurant

<Content> Honestly one of the best quick meals that I really enjoy. I go there a lot. The same few guys are usually working and whip the food up quick. They have a $4.99 daily deal that always hits the spot and their honey grilled chicken oh honey don't get me started That and their steak quesadillas are my regular. Chips and guac is a must you get a monster guac thing so you don't run out I hate when I run out of guac. There fish burrito is good too load up on the special fishy sauce I like it. The tacos are good too. Man everything is good and you should just check this spot out. I don't really mess with the delivery cause it takes like 30 minutes and you can be in and out in 5. You can win a free burrito at the gumball machine but I'm currently 0 for like 100 so not likely. But yeah this place is better then waiting in that chipotle line plus I just like it more better bang for your buck!

<Content> I had the honey grilled chicken burrito. I thought it was good. You can choose white rice, spanish rice, pinto beans, black beans to add to it. You also have the choice of tomato, onion, lettuce, hot sauce or mild, sour cream.  The people working there were very helpful and let me try samples of the chicken before ordering. I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't think it's there yet. Also, the fish tacos are really awesome.

<Content> Dude how could I not be a fan when my first experience with this place is that they hand me a gigantic, free chicken burrito?? I hope that they get some spillover traffic from the Subway next door, because I can tell the locals that own the franchise are workin' hard and I don't want them to get eaten by economy like so many other local businesses (i.e., papa george, sweet indulgence, pages for all ages)

<Content> The service is pretty good.I've tried their tacos and burritos, both the chicken chipotle and steak varieties. Neither really has much flavor. You can try to compensate by adding a lot of toppings, like everyone does there, but then they just taste like undressed salads.

<Content> Good tofu burritos are hard to come by in Champaign-Urbana. In fact, the Cactus Grill offers the only one I know of at a restaurant in town ... with some nicely grilled veggies. It's an independent, tasty burrito joint in Champaign, IL, so of course it's not quite what you might find in Arizona or California or whatever -- but the food is good and the folks behind the counter know how to use a tortilla.

<Content> Has one of the widest varieties of options for varieties for a burrito chain I've even been to. I love that they have tofu as an option but I also can get fish tacos if I'm feeling that. The daily special's are a plus, which made lunch here affordable. They also do free or $1 burrito day which is AWESOME. Good quality food, decent prices, and the management is fantastic. I keep going back when I'm in town. Love it.

<Content> I've tried this place a couple of times.. i could not stand how bland the food was. nothing tasted good. the food looked like it was at least a month old.plus, the last two times I ordered, i didn't get a fork, napkin, and they didn't give me the correct order either. I can't believe I tipped the driver, too.

<Content> The service is really great and the food is tasty. I wouldn't give them the full 5 stars because the burritos are a little dry. However - they do know how to make a fish taco and the fish they use is delicious!

<Content> Restaurant reviewThis place gets a 5 star based on the bargain price for mexican food. I can't say that food is 5 stars, often it is above average with what you would find at a mexican non-chain restaurant but the prices are a bargain for what you get. For the lunch special 7 dollars we got the mix plate that had shrimp, chicken, and beef on it This was quite a bargain for the amount of food you got. The ambience leaves much to be desired though so don't expect a classy restaurant. Expect great prices and solid traditional mexican food.Pro: inexpensive, free chips/salsaCons: Hit or miss entrees Hidden gem:Come for the lunch special, cheap and lots of varietyFree chips/salsa

<Content> The ironclad rule of BBQ and Mexican joints is, the worse the place looks on the outside, the better the food is on the inside.Dos Reales looks like a dump. The food is outstanding.First off, you'll notice the menu is enormous. It takes some time to sift through all the options. On a friend's recommendation, I got the burrito bravo - just an enormous burrito. You can choose steak or chicken. I ordered steak, but my girlfriend got a taco with the chicken and it was mindblowing. (The chicken is shredded and pulls apart, like what you get out of a slow cooker.)If I went again, I'd go with chicken for sure.The house margarita was just so-so. A little too tart for my taste.Service was excellent, quick and friendly.And everything is absurdly cheap.It's a shame they close so early, because this would be amazing hangover food. (Someone needs to throw their hours up on Yelp. The day we called, they closed at 10:30 p.m.)

<Content> This place shouldn't be as popular as it is. I got a enchilada, taco, and chulupa combo and couldn't tell the difference between the three items, they all looked the same. The sauces they use for their food was bland. As a Latino, I enjoy authentic food and good Tex-mex food but this food didn't fit into either category. This place will overcharge for a taco. Yes, their burritos are huge but any Mexican restaurant has huge burritos. I was confused on their decor. It looks as if three people decorated at the same time. Champaign has so many Mexican restaurant options, that it's not worth trying this one. I will not be returning here.

<Content> This by far is the worst Mexican food i have ever had. Their skirt steak was drier than a beef jerky and the sauce on top looked like diarrhea. The so called best dish they serve, enchilldas tasted like Swanson's frozen mexican dinner. A huge portion of horse poop is still Kaakaa. All the rave reviews are about their margaritas, so the majority of people are bunch of drunks who have absolutely no taste buds.

<Content> Three and a half stars! I love coming to Dos, as we affectionately call it, whenever I'm in Champaign. There's a ton on the menu to choose from, some good specials, and good prices! Plus, who can pass up unlimited chips and salsa?Every time I've come here the place has been packed, which speaks about how good it is!I ordered the chicken enchiladas suiza- chicken enchiladas covered in a cheese sauce (yummmm) and served with sides of rice (refried or black) and rice. The beans covered in the queso from the enchiladas is out of this world. I have started making my own because it's that delicious. My only complaint was that the chicken was little dry inside the enchiladas, but everything else was good.The server was very friendly and called us amigo and amiga. Our drinks and food were served in a timely fashion too. When we left, we had to push through a crowd of people to get out the door. Love Dos!

<Content> Completely generic. From the faux adobe building, generic bar, and at best mediocre food. Though somehow this place is always packed and many consider the premiere Tex-Mex place in Chambana. Service is not out right bad on purpose, just slow and uninformed. The menu is as generic as it gets, and without the nostalgic feel I get from Fiesta, let alone the uniqueness from Wedge, Escabar's, or Maize. The who's who of safe, mass pleasing food items. Which has its place, but really nothing I care for. Nothing special bar wise either. Salsa is week, chips stale, guac is not fresh. That is just the starters. Everything just uninspired.A place I can't even give a good old local star bump a la Fiesta Cafe. Nothing I can really recommend here.

<Content> One of the best Mexican places in Champaign-Urbana. Every time I go, I'm never disappointed. I also love the decor. They definitely embrace their culture with the decor. Every time I go I'm seated in a new place and I have different decor to look at it. The whole restaurant is shaped as a adobe too.At my latest trip here, I had a margarita for the first time. I love that they had margaritas on their daily specials. It was a blue margarita and it was worth the $5.75. My friends got mango margaritas and those were pretty good too!I think the best part of Dos Reales is the amount of food you get for your money. You definitely get a lot of food for what you pay. This time around I stuck to just a carne asada quesadilla. It was so simple, but incredibly tasty. Also when you sit down, they give you a basket of chips and two kinds of salsa. I love when that happens. The service was pretty good, too. The waiter was attentive and would frequently refill our water. He also made a joke about refilling out margaritas.I'll definitely keep going back.Just make sure that you have a empty stomach when you go or you might end up taking home leftovers, which isn't bad a thing though.

<Content> I went here, and with the huge 45 minute wait, I was expecting amazing food, What I got was meh food, Our server was on top of the table, but my meal came out a good 10 minutes after my dining partners meal, and while the server was super apologetic, food should never come out so far apart! And to be honest the food I got well, it was just bland, and boring, It was terrible. Maybe its because I am used to getting authentic Mexican food, but even compared to the tex-mex I get this was sub par. Although you do get a nice portion for the price that you are paying, so there is that.Long story short, this place is perfect for people with huge appetites, small budgets, and those who care about quantity over quality.In other words a typical college student. I really wouldn't recommend it for anyone else.

<Content> This is my favorite Mexican place in town! Full disclosure, the Tex part of the Tex-Mex is very dominant, and yes, the food used to be better years ago. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this is not the place for you. However, if you're looking for a tasty meal in a casual setting, with very generous portions, try them out. My favorite is always the fajitas set, with sizzling fajitas, hot sides, and warm tortillas.

<Content> I came here with a big group of people, for a friend's birthday dinner. Though I'm an omnivore, the vegetarian options were apparently pretty good, so we settled on Dos Reales over a few other options. The service was great, and the waiters were welcoming. I ordered a carnitas dinner, which provided me with enough food for two meals. The pork was cooked to perfection, and the rest of the plate (beans, rice, lettuce, tomatoes) was pretty standard for Mexican food around here. I really enjoyed the sauce on the carnitas, which was the highlight of my meal. It could have come with a few more tortillas, though; the dish only came with three, which was definitely not enough for this huge meal. As much as I enjoyed the food, you have to remember that you're eating at a Mexican restaurant a few blocks away from the highway in central Illinois. The location and the atmosphere, even though the restaurant looks decently clean and well-kept, is still a little bit off, and I'm reluctant to give it a fifth star, as much as I enjoyed the food and the service.

<Content> Um, this place is a tradition - a staple for all graduating UIUC folk like myself. I didn't fully appreciate it when I was there. Senior year, I started going more often, to partake in the insanely cheap margaritas and filling, hearty Mexican food. Now, whenever I visit my campus, I return to get my fill of the deliciousness.I love how incredibly inexpensive this place is. Seriously, $16 for a 60 oz pitcher of margaritas? WHAT? We'll take two, thanks. $9.50 for a big portion of fajitas with tons of delicious beans, rice, and guac? Totes. And if you order off the ala carte menu, you can practically pay with change from under your couch.It's actually pretty tasty too. I looooove their tamales. The bean burritos are pretty good too, and as soon as I bite into that familiar salsa, I melt. They refill the chips constantly. Portions are large and satisfying - it's pretty classic Mexican food for an American crowd, not reinventing the wheel here, but it's consistent and nostalgic. The margaritas are always delicious, though sometimes they are stronger than others. Service is usually very friendly and quick. It's like memories covered in chile sauce with a side of beans and rice. Dos Reales, I'll always love you.I bet this place gets mad crowded since they closed the Dos on University Ave. Why on earth would they do that? Shame. Now you need to have a designated driver instead of being able to stumble back to Green Street after dinner.

<Content> Basically, a whole lot of decent Mexican food for not a whole lot of money.The place was packed with college kids, so it was pretty busy. The wait staff was excellent, with super fast service and just very attentive. The food though, was pretty standard Mexican fare. Nothing that really stood out. One disappointment though was the quesadilla that I ordered had this incredibly thick and disgusting cheese on it. Now I love cheese, but this just did not taste good, and I could barely take more than 2 bites out of it before giving up.Extra points for portions, for being cheap, and for blazing fast service.

<Content> Wow...fellow Yelpers (and Illini, more importantly)...really?! How can you think this is the "best Mexican ever"?! Even by Champaign standards, I'd rather go to Chipotle or Qdoba any day of the week (I know, that is saying a lot!). The first time I went here, my roommate and I both felt sick. For some reason, we got talked into giving it another chance. No miracles happened the second time either. The food is super bland and just tastes like a huge mess on your plate. I tried...I really did. But a lot of Illini are from northern Illinois...and with all the Mexican choices in Chicago, I'm pretty disappointed in yall :/

<Content> I've been to Dos way too many times now. The food is generally mediocre at best. The first time I went, we literally got our food 30 seconds after ordering (I'm still trying to figure out how this was even possible). 30 second food simply can't be good and it wasn't. They seem to keep all their basic ingredients in huge warming trays in back: mexican rice, refried beans, chicken, beef (and these ingredients just don't taste that great). Then, they do some crazy fast assembly and bring it out after a short stint under the broiler. The only time I've really enjoyed my food was the time I ordered fajitas (I don't think they've figured out a good way to make these ahead of time). So, I'd recommend staying away from the combo plates, but once you do that the price isn't that great (~$10 for entrees).You must be thinking, If i disliked the food so much, why am I giving them 3 stars? Damn good margaritas! Definitely the strongest I've had in the C-U area. They always have the 32 oz pitcher for like $9.75, which split between 2 people, is more than enough to get you both pretty wasted (or, if you're really ambitious, just drink the whole 32 oz pitcher). So, if you order the margaritas before the food, you likely won't care enough once you get your food to hate it. Works like a charm every time! But, If you're not 21 yet, I'd suggest going to a place with better food!Service is generally pretty good. I've only had 1 slow waiter, which isn't the worst track record for a restaurant. Long story short: Bad to mediocre food, amazing margaritas, decent service.

I love white cheese dip, and their's is pretty tasty. Guacamole is also good, which I get on the Chalupa. I've also tried their quesadillas, which are stuffed with fillings and white cheese dip (not flat).

<Content> My co-worker and I were passing through town and decided we needed to eat before we passed through. We literally chose an exit and saw DOS Reales and decided to give it a try. The parking lot was packed so we were wondering how long it would be to get seated. Luckily, the place is rather large so we were seated right away. The menu is huge...so many options. I had a hard time deciding so I asked our waiter what he recommended and he said "Acapulco." I asked him what the most popular dish was and he responded with the same dish.I ended up ordering the Acapulco and the waiter said that if I did not like it, he would let me order something else instead. When the dish came, I could not believe how much food was there! The meat mixture of steak, chicken and shrimp was yummy. The chicken enchilada included was good as well. There were two disappointments. The rice was not very good, it was VERY dry. Also, the dish said it would be smothered in cheese but when it came, I would not call it smothered. It just had a small portion of cheese on it.Regardless of the two disappointments, the rest of the experience was good. I would recommend this place.

Don't even think about going to the one on University (well, unless you're on campus or the line at the Prospect one is ridiculous).Why they're awesome? Everything on their menu is delicious and comes in ginormous portions! And those of you who can finish a burrito bravo in one sitting seriously deserve some sort of medal.Also, Dos has SUPER fast service - your orders come out in like 5 minutes.

<Content> I'm from the Bay Area in California, so there are no shortage of GOOD taquerias in our area. This place did not even come close.I had a fajita quesadilla with chicken I believe, which was pretty disappointing. It tasted like they just used Kraft Singles american cheese in the quesadilla, which is definitely NOT the right kind of cheese for this sort of thing. The texture of the quesadilla just left a dry feeling in my mouth. The saving grace of this place is that they have really good tortilla chips that come with your meal, and the salsa was okay. Sorry to say, but I would probably not come back here again.

<Content> It's the best damn Mexican food in Champaign, and it's only given me the poops maybe one, two times? In all honesty, the service here is pretty fast and polite, and when the food comes out I am rarely disappointed. Very few items are strictly vegetarian as almost everything is made with animal fat or cheese. However, if you can put the fact that in one way or another you're probably eating animal byproduct (or just product) then it's great. I love the DR!Note: I never eat there anymore because (SURPRISE!) it's really fattening.

<Content> I used to be a Dos or Die kind of Mexican food eater. However, after years of eating here I still like it, but it could use some more variety. Everything you order is some combination of the same ingredients: chopped steak or chicken, ground beef, rice and beans, lettuce, cheese, and sometimes guacamole and sour cream. It's good, but it can be redundant. The chips are horrible, but the salsa has a good "kick" to it. My favorite has to be the fajita quesadilla. I usually order it with shrimp and steak, and it is delicious. If you like peppers and want a gigantic portion of food that you probably won't finish, then this is the meal for you. Oh, and if you want fried ice cream be prepared to share--it comes in a whopping portion with a huge topping of whipped cream. Another bonus is that it is kid-friendly. The waiters are good with children and make them feel welcome. The food is also a hit with the kids.

And yes, some of the food is americanized Mexican, but some of it IS authentic, and it's ALL delicious. And if you tip well, they will remember you and treat you like royalty. Of course, there's no reason NOT to tip well, as long as the service is friendly. And when the service is as good as it is here, a stellar tip is really a moral imperative.

<Content> I ate at this restaurant regularly for the 4 years I went to UIUC. After Over 90% of the time, I didn't even stop when entering the restaurant because they were ready to seat the next group-seemingly regardless of how busy the place was! The staff is remarkably professional, courteous, and polite. Then after they seat you insanely quickly, they prepare your food at lightning speed as well. Here's the kicker: the food is actually great! If you love cheap Mexican food, I can't imagine why you would go anywhere else in Chambana. I recommend ordering their chicken chimichanga a la carte. A great deal, no this and that to deal with on the side, and just enough to fill a girl's belly!

If you're looking for a chicken fajita to come out sizzling in less than five minutes, they're the place.The staff is always unreasonably nice for the amount of business they turn out. The place is pretty clean and has plenty of seating. The prices are good at about $6-8 a plate.Sometimes I wonder how they made my food so fast, though...

<Content> I ate at this restaurant regularly for the 4 years I went to UIUC. After Over 90% of the time, I didn't even stop when entering the restaurant because they were ready to seat the next group-seemingly regardless of how busy the place was! The staff is remarkably professional, courteous, and polite. Then after they seat you insanely quickly, they prepare your food at lightning speed as well. Here's the kicker: the food is actually great! If you love cheap Mexican food, I can't imagine why you would go anywhere else in Chambana. I recommend ordering their chicken chimichanga a la carte. A great deal, no this and that to deal with on the side, and just enough to fill a girl's belly!

<Content> I used to be a Dos or Die kind of Mexican food eater. However, after years of eating here I still like it, but it could use some more variety. Everything you order is some combination of the same ingredients: chopped steak or chicken, ground beef, rice and beans, lettuce, cheese, and sometimes guacamole and sour cream. It's good, but it can be redundant. The chips are horrible, but the salsa has a good "kick" to it. My favorite has to be the fajita quesadilla. I usually order it with shrimp and steak, and it is delicious. If you like peppers and want a gigantic portion of food that you probably won't finish, then this is the meal for you. Oh, and if you want fried ice cream be prepared to share--it comes in a whopping portion with a huge topping of whipped cream. Another bonus is that it is kid-friendly. The waiters are good with children and make them feel welcome. The food is also a hit with the kids.

<Content> Loved it tonight, as always. Staff is totally accommodating. Service is amazingly fast. And yes, some of the food is americanized Mexican, but some of it IS authentic, and it's ALL delicious. And if you tip well, they will remember you and treat you like royalty. Of course, there's no reason NOT to tip well, as long as the service is friendly. And when the service is as good as it is here, a stellar tip is really a moral imperative.

<Content> One of the most difficult things about moving downstate was not having good taqueria food - and then I noticed my friend writing Facebook status updates about how he was having "Dos for dinner" or "Dos delivers!" It took me several months of building anticipation to finally drive myself to Dos to order a shrimp fajita salad to go. I swear that this salad could cure world hunger! The thing is HUGE, tasty, and came with chips and salsa! My salad only cost a little bit over $10 with tax and was prepared in under 15 minutes. Quite impressive!I dined here for the first time with my boyfriend and friend, and was equally impressed with the quick table and food service. We had lunch specials that cost well-below $8 with tax and were so filling. The restaurant's ambiance is nice and great for groups. I've even brought my parents here and they really enjoy it to the point where when they visit, it's likely for us to order takeout from here. My only caveat is that the food can be incredibly rich.

<Content> This place was frighteningly crowded when we went. Urbana-Champaign has a lot of restaurants, but judging by the teeming masses at Dos Reales, you'd think it was the only place to eat in the entire universe. They have a "wait until your number is called"-system, which worked okay, but that's only because one of us heard the faint shout of our number being called.I have nothing against the service or the food. The service was incredibly fast, given how many people were in that vast Mexican food labyrinth. Our server was nice, too, which I wouldn't have expected. The chips and salsa were tasty, as was my food and margarita (the margarita was strong, which is oh-so-important). We got to stay as long as we wanted without getting the stink eye. Not too shabby.

<Content> Dos is definitely the place to go if you're looking for a lot of food for a great price. I've been here too many times to count. It's a lot of fun to just go there to drink, be with friends and eat til your stomach explodes. On the weekends during the school year it gets pretty packed in there and you might have to wait but I would say it's worth it. I love the enchiladas supremas and the burrito bravo (and yes it is big and yes I ate it in one sitting once... sad). They also have great margaritas. If you have cheap college friends (which if you're in college I'm sure you have), this is a prefect place to go!

And since the huge yummy lunch combos are like $5, I can eat until I think I'm going to die and have leftover to take home!My favorite things I've had are the chiles rellenos and the margaritas, YUM.Word of advice though, if you try to take home the chips in your leftover box, they will return to soggy tortilla pieces in your fridge and it will be heartbreaking.

<Content> Went here because of the good reviews--not impressed. We got two bowls of "salsa," the milder of which tasted like unseasoned canned tomatoes, and the other was pretty much the same except for a bit of pepper and onion. We added some hot sauce not necessarily because we wanted a lot of spice, but just to give it some flavor. Enchilada sauce was also pretty bland and tasteless. Meat was good though. I asked twice for a diet coke that I never received. On the plus side, the food is inexpensive and plentiful, but there are better alternatives in town.

Dos Reales rules the mexican food kingdom of Champaign-Urbana. I miss their chicken quesadilla -- big enough for 2 easily and super cheap. Service was always friendly. If you go on a weekend night, be prepared for a wait. But it WILL be worth it.

They also do take-out which is amazing because you can go in, order, and leave with your meal within 10 minutes. Sure it's not as fast as McDonald's, but it's way better. Only downside, it can get busy during high-peak times and the line can get long.

<Content> If you live in CU and haven't been to Dos you need to go. The first time I went I really wasn't impressed that much, but my longtime CU resident friend convinced me to go back and try something else. I did. The Chicken Fajita Quesadilla.  It has to be one of the best and most satisfying "Mexican" meals I have eaten. Don't think for a moment that this is real authentic Mexican, what it is is amazingly gooey, cheesy sauce covering succulent chicken, peppers, and onions all in and on a HUGE tortilla. If you are in the mood for some Mexican flavors go here and order this. Not only does it cost $6.50, but me and my friends usually split it between two people and with free chips and salsa plus tip get away for about $4-$5 a person, it rocks!

<Content> So very disappointed in most of the reviews of Dos. Yes, it is good, but they are so intent on getting the patrons in and out as quickly as possible that it really takes the enjoyment out of the whole experience for me. If I want fast Mexican food, I'll go to some corporate dump thank-you-very-much. El Toro is a step up, but the true gem of C-U Mexican cuisine is Fiesta Cafe. The margaritas are outstanding, the fajitas large enough for me to split with my husband (that's saying something for us) and the waitstaff actually remembers their regulars. Te amo, Fiesta Cafe!

I need a DR." Yeah, I know groan. But seriously the food was always very large, very fast, tasty, and within budget. I tried the rest of the mexican joints in the C-U and the dr. was always the best. What can you ask. Now, living in Chicago, surrounded by many, many Mexican restaurants. I still yearn for the food here. A case of memory being better than reality? Maybe. But I still get reports for younger folk at U of I that the dr. is still the sh*t (pardon my lang). So it still gets 5 stars.

<Content> This review is a few years old, I'm afraid.When we lived in Champaign this was our favorite Mexican restaurant. The wait staff was pretty cheerful every time we came and the food always came out fast, hot, and plentiful. I LOVED this nacho dish thing that used to come out covered in lettuce. Someone mentioned the white cheese sauce in another review and that was what I loved. So addictively yummy. It might have been the Guadalajara Special, but whatever it was I used to think it was funny having to find the food by excavating the lettuce. That was back when I could get an alcoholic drink with my meal and not endanger my spawn, of course.Husband used to get the chicken fajitas. Huge mound of chicken. Like.. half a chicken or something, along with all the expected veg, etc. I've lived in California (North and South) and Texas and I still recommend this place. Yes, I've been to really authentic places. I don't care, maybe my palate is polluted by Tex-Mex, but I still loved my favorite dishes at Dos Reales. To be fair, I don't know about any menu items I haven't tried. DOS Reales I miss you!

<Content> Great Mexican restaurant in Champaign. Their bottomless chips - that came out hot - with two different kinds of salsa was a great way to start off the meal. I'm not sure what equates as "great" for others, but Dos Reales was soo good. I had the choritacos with chicken, and mmm out came three STUFFED flour tacos stuffed with spicy chorizo and (slightly dry) chicken and liberally sprinkled with lettuce, cilantro, and diced onions. Everyone I went with loved what they got - my sister got the vegetarian fajita quesadilla and MMMM lots of cheese and stewed veggies. The price isn't too bad, $8 for a huge dinner-sized plate during lunch, and the servers were very nice and helpful and the service was very fast. I recommend this place over fast food chain of stomach churning Chipotle. SO GOOD!

Although I graduated from UIUC 6 years ago (omg has it really been that long?) I find myself finding excuses to make the 3 hour drive down there just to eat the amazing sizzling fajitas. I'm not saying it's the most authentic place, but cheap, great food that comes out FAST is good enough for me. The margaritas are also very yummy :)This is also the best location. I was SO excited about finding out about a Dos Reales in Rockford, IL... but EH.

BUT... if you drink enough.... it IS great mexican. (it's passable.)bottom line. go there to drink, firstly. enjoy the food, secondary to the drinking. get great service while you do that.

<Content> Dos Reales is hands down the best Mexican restaurant that I have ever been to. First, the food is great. Anything you get on the menu is amazing from their burritos, tostadas, steak dishes, veggie dishes, you name it. Furthermore, they come in huge portions with most dishes ranging in the $6-11 area for lunch and dinner. If you want a food coma for cheap, Dos Reales is simply the place to go. Second, the waiters are great. They are friendly and bring the food out fast. Plus, they come to your table about every 10 minutes to check if everything is ok. This is nice when you actually need something, but gets annoying when you don't. I appreciate their concern though, which is why I like them. :)Third, free chips with salsa before your meal!!!!!

Pitchers of XX for $6, meals all under $10, and the best salsa and chips in town. The only thing I would suggest straying from would be the nacho plates---soggy and light on cheese--just order a cheese dip and call it a day.

<Content> Um, there's no place like this place - anywhere. Partly due to nostaligia and partly due to the sheer brilliance of a super-fast Mexican joint with super-friendly servers (HI FREDDY!!! --our fave) and super deliciously satisfying hangover (or non hangover food), with excellently strong margaritas, in walking distance from campus....oh my I could go on and on and on and on.I miss you, Dos. You can never be replaced in my heart.Mmm cheese enchiladas, beans, and rice. And. A big-ass margarita. If it's your birthday, they give you the special birthday sombrero and a treat. And often, a side cup with some extra tequila. Which....is not high quality. But perfect for Chambana. Pretty freakin awesome place.

<Content> Good, consistent, and cheap! This is one of our favorite places to go in Champaign. A sit down meal for two with an appetizer is usually less than $20. Endless chips and two kinds of salsa. The carry-out orders come with lots of free chips and salsa too. If you're not starving, consider the a la carte options - you will be amazed how cheap your meal is! If you ARE starving, they have combo deals that come on two loaded plates. Yum!

<Content> Well, I was underwhelmed.I went in to this place, expecting good, authentic Mexican food. What I got was authentic.Starters: Chips and salsa - two types of salsa, no explanation. It's not like we can't figure out one is hot and one isn't, but the dishes were small, and it went quick.The main course - we ordered a bunch of different stuff for our party of 4. One order got messed up. I ordered a Burrito Supremo, but it was more like a Burrito el-blando. It had no zip to it at all - I've had better Burritos at Food Life in Chicago.Honestly, I've had better Mexican food at La Mex. If I'm dying for Mexican food, I guess I'll give it another try, but there has to be better Mexican than this in Champaign.

<Content> I partly judge a Mexican restaurant by the Queso Fundido (cheese with chorizo), and theirs is really great. Order it and really enjoy - and use it on the chips.  The best Mex in Champaign. I know Mexican is very different in varoius parts of the country -- and many dishes in Mexico would not go over well in the MidWest.  Only been to Prospect location. And like the outdoor (even if a bit too close to the street area) on a nice warm day with a Margarita!

<Content> I have been here many times and have not had good food on any of those occasions. The food is always covered in sauce and very bland. It definitely feels like a place that just keeps their food warm in the back or something and trots it out. It's never gross out bad, but I always leave wishing we had gone somewhere else. I wouldn't eat here again. It always surprises me how much people like this place and flock to it.

<Content> This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in my life.The service is top notch. Everyone treats you like a king. You get unlimited chips/salsa and waiters/waitresses are always eager to get you what you want.The food is unbelievable. They give you so much food for the money, but it still tastes great! I would recommend the acapulco. It has steak, chicken, shrimp, a pork chimichanga, salsa, guac, chips, rice, and 3 tortillas. This is under $10!!Highly recommendedService: 10/10Food : 10/10Wait time: around 10-15 minutes.

<Content> I absolutely love Dos Reales. The waitstaff is very attentive and friendly, and the food is delicious and not too pricey. Everything is good here; I specifically like the Burrito Fajita (with steak) yum!

<Content> I visited this Restaurant on my recent trip down memory lane while visiting my Alma Mater. My friends and I ate here whenever we craved good Mexican food. The best part is if you are a vegetarian they have 6 combinations listed out for you. Now the nachos and salsa still did the trick but the rest of the food can only be called ok though my kids liked the Mexican Mac and cheese. The place also looked in need of some upgrades. Sometimes you need to let memories be memories - but since I already touched this one I will try again and order something different the next time I get a chance to be in the CU area.

<Content> I used to be a Dos Reales partisan myself - until the last few visits. Both locations have been dicey in recent years - my main complaint is that on multiple occasions my stomach "rejected" my meal shortly after leaving the restaurant. Went down fine but didn't stay. I know what yr thinking - I was sober as a judge and most definitely not hung-over. I wish it wasn't so, but I have crossed Dos off my list, same experience with La Bamba. But yes, cheap and good - I'm not saying yr going to barf, just that I did. Twice.

<Content> Dirty bathrooms, bland, vaguely gross food (e.g,. a beef burrito is a flour tortilla with 3/4 cup of ground beef -- and nothing else -- doused in salsa). Cheap beer in dirty pitchers. Friendly, fast staff. Very cheap, but you get what you pay for.

<Content> Dopest Dope Ever Ate. Yeah! I heard the hype and it lived up to it. The menu was extensive, but I just got off the special board. I got the monster margarita: two coronas in a 32 oz strawberry margarita. And a M-something burrito: Steak, Bacon, Onions, and Cheese sauce. Portions were large. Environment was great.

<Content> Dos has an appeal that is hard to define. It's not gourmet and it's not an authentic cultural experience. It is pretty standard American-Mexican food with lots of white cheese and basic ingredients. And yet, somehow it's a cut above other places which follow that formula. I always come away feeling quite satisfied. You can't beat the value, especially for the lunch specials.

<Content> I give this five stars not because its as good as it gets anywhere but it is definitely as good as it gets locally. Their chimichangas are so good it's all I get when I go there. There prices are good and the speed of service is amazing. Portions sizes are definitely split-able.

<Content> i think i finally found a decent mexican restaurant in c-u! i went for lunch on a few occasions and thoroughly enjoyed my lunch specials. i like that it's fast and the food comes out hot. i've tried the guadalajara lunch special, which is my favorite. their salsa is so delish! they refill your drinks without having to ask. oh, and their margaritas are yummy as well! kind of difficult to pour if you get the pitcher, it spills everywhere, but other than that, it's ok. i think i've tried almost every mexican restaurant in town and will only go back to dos reales. although it's nothing compared to the mexican restaurants back home (l.a.)!!!

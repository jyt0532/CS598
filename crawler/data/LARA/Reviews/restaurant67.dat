<Content> Frankly, the idea that the restaurant is a front for laundering drug money wasn't all that far-fetched on the ride home. That should say it all when it comes to the food quality, atmosphere and overall experience. On a drive by, it's a seemingly hole in the wall bbq joint, which I would be perfectly happy with if the food was right. However once you step inside, a flabbergasted look will certainly come across your face when you see a former tiki bar semi-turned family restaurant. The flat screen tv blares trashy reality tv, the Christmas lights and lava lamps dimly light your tables and movie posters of no particular rhyme or reason dot the walls - overall giving this place as bizarre a dining atmosphere as I've found in C-U. A friend and I tried their BBQ pork sandwich special. The sauce, mix in this case, was a little sweet but had a nice kick, not bad. The pork was a little dried out but I've had worse. The sides were really underwhelming and pricey - 2 oz of generic cole slaw or mac n' cheese for $2.00 is just kind of frustrating. Their fries may have been actually cut and fried in the back, but a few hours under hot lamps undid all the crispiness and hard work put in. We did not try their self proclaimed famous pound cakes, but did try a 2 oz. container of peach cobbler that was heavily spiced and sweetened, it kind of whacked you over the head when you tasted it. I don't have a ton of hope for the rest of the menu, the expected delicious aromas of a smoker was sadly missing from this joint, so all I can be is optimistic in hoping they're not just dethawing Restaurant Co.'s bbq fare. Unfortunately for these guys, there's much better barbeque to be had in Champaign-Urbana . Famous Dave's, Hickory River, Black Dog and even Lil' Porgys make this place seem amateur and unmotivated. At least you can buy scented candles on the way out.

<Content> Restaurant reviewI have never been to a arby's before today and I would say I actually like it a lot. They had the new smokehouse burger which was brisket smoked for 12+ hours. The food is prepared fresh, service was friendly. The store itself was super clean as well. The only major problem is the parking lot is small and we had to circle around twice to get a parking spot. Pro: curly fries, friendly fast serviceCons: small parking lotHidden gem:Sign up online email to get a free roast beef classic when you buy a drink

<Content> I just had the roast turkey Farmhouse salad and I thought it was great!! It's simple. Lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese and pepper bacon. I have my suspicions that the pepper bacon is what made this salad but I will try to ignore that. The ranch dressing is made by Mazettis and that helps too. On the web site it claims to only have 230 calories in the Farmhouse salad. I am sure that is without the salad dressing but who cares!!!

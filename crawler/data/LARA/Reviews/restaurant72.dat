<Content> I had the number one. It took as long as it normally does for a human being to assemble a Big Mac, put some fries in a container and place it on a tray. The coke from the fountain was fine.After I finished the meal,I went back to the counter and ordered a "mcflurry" which was pretty good as well.Thank goodness for McDonalds. This is why America is awesome.I even used the restroom, which was relatively clean, considering how crowded the place was on a Monday at 2:30 in the afternoon.

<Content> How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways.Seriously. I hate this McDonalds.I'm obsessed with McDonald's breakfast and I'm a fatty so I come here every morning before class. Out of the million times I've come here, I've gotten the right order THREE TIMES. I'm not exaggerating. I'm DEAD serious.I know it seems confusing why I would continue to come here after all those mess ups but I had no choice since I'm addicted to their breakfast and it's the closest to my classes.Idk if there's an issue with management or with the workers but they need to shape up.

<Content> It's not much different from most other McDonald's. Even if they are really busy, I still get my food fast and accurate. Customer service is average.

<Content> It's McDonald's. Enough said. Service can range time to time, but that's expected with fast food. Always make sure you have everything in your bag after ordering, and just go back and ask if not - no big deal. I would recommend the dollar menu, as you can get a McChicken, McDouble, large fries, and a large drink for only $5 total.Here's a tip - If you order any sized value meal, you can upgrade your drink to a large free of charge because all drinks are $1!!!

<Content> On my first visit to this store, I had a bad experience because of an employee who was rude to me. They have an arcane policy that if you happen to have a water bottle with you, you are not allowed to have it in the store at all. Instead of showing any appreciation for my patronage, she scolded me in front of three other front counter employees and several customers, at full volume, and I will remember how that made me feel.I called the 800 number for corporate and they understood the concern, will review the complaint according to company policy, and assured me that they appreciate their customers. They did everything they could to make the situation better. Even though I pass this McDonald's often, I am unsure if I will return to this particular store ever again. There is a Subway half a block away and I think they will get most of my fast food business from now on.

<Content> ok so we all know that mcdonalds is awesome. there's nothing i can complain about. EXCEPT that here, they tell you they gave you a straw in your bag but you look in it after you drive away and it's not there. Liars!

<Content> McDonalds is generally McDonalds. The food here is fine, but service/atmosphere is lacking. They seem to have some sketchy clientele (almost saw a fight break out here once). Also, they have very strict BBQ sauce quotas. Unless you buy mcnuggets or chicken selects, they make you pay for any bbq sauce you want ($0.25/pack); I think it's sort of ridiculous that you can't get free bbq sauce with your chicken sandwich.

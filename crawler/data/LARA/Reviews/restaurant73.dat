<Content> My grandparents are long-time fans of the Ribeye, and I have joined them at the Ribeye on two separate occasions. Both times, the hostesses and the servers were extremely nice to them - treating them like local celebrities - and anyone who is that nice to my grandparents is okay with me! The Ribeye has a relatively limited menu and their specialty is the ribeye (surprise, surprise). The salad bar and baked potato are included with the ribeye dinner, and both are pretty good. The overall ambiance of the Ribeye is relatively casual, and they have a lot of Fighting Illini memorabilia. I think some of the reviewers who were disappointed with this place may have been expecting something along the lines of Morton's or Gibson's in Chicago - the Ribeye is not that.

<Content> Don't know how to give 1-2 stars or I would downgrade the rating. If you're gonna name yourself after a cut of meat, I believe the meat shouldn't be substandard. Ribeye is my favorite steak but this did not cut it. Added sauted onions and mushrooms to the meal and to my surprise they were button mushrooms. The small loaves of bread were hot coming to the table. I had one slice - average. The best thing going on was the salad bar and even it lacked. By that I mean the lettuce was tired. However a good variety of other things were there. Large portions - that's the best I can say. And that it was walking distance from the hotel. But if it's meh, who cares?

<Content> I like to play a game when I am traveling for my job with the hotel staff to help me find restaurants. The game is pretty simple and it cuts all of the crap that you get from hotel staff trying to be overly friendly. Ask " Where would you go tonight if cost didn't matter?" And if that doesn't work ask "What restaurant is your favorite?" "What would you get?"First time out of maybe a hundred i didn't get a good recommendation. The staff is very friendly so I gave two stars, but when I go somewhere for food I want good food. The quality of the steak is on par with almost expired meat from walmart. Harsh but true. I feed my dog steak once a year for his birthday and the low grade steak I get from my butcher for him is better than this. Also I am glad that I read some reviews on here before I went because they serve the steak on a frying pan that is cast iron and very, very hot. The result I ordered my steak rare expecting it to come out medium rare it was closer to medium and by the time I was finished with a 12 oz. it was going towards medium well. The salad bar was the only redeeming quality. It had a fairly decent selection of different salads; such as pasta salad, potato salad and so forth. The basic salad is a kind of build your own house salad with a few simple dressings and a large variety of toppings that are typical in the Midwest. (Sorry reviewer from Cali I know people from Cali and they are always disappointed by our smaller selection of vegetables offered for vegans in Midwest restaurants)The price for a 12 oz twice baked potato (mediocre and two hot to eat because it was served on a skillet so it didn't cool down) and a sprite. 29 bucks before the tip. This is DEFINITELY a favorite of the locals because of all of the Illini stuff on the wall but the rest of the decor was just covered up fake wood paneling from the 70's/80's will black painted drop tile. In short, find somewhere else there are plenty of places to eat in Champaign/Urbana.

<Content> Mediocre at best. The steak is cooked nicely but under seasoned as were the saut onions I had to go with the meat. Our waiter raved about how great the twice baked potatoes were but I'd have to disagree. Maybe I don't have a taste for them in general but it tasted bland and very average. Plus the peal at the bottom was rock hard so I could eat it. Salad bar was pretty good and I enjoyed what they had to offer there but overall I thought that paying $30 for this and a single beer was a bit much for what I got. Our waiter did a great job and I kinda like the nostalgic feel of the decor even though I'm not really an Illini fan. Don't plan to visit again unless someone else is buying.

<Content> If you understand what the Ribeye is and go in there with the right mindset, you will not be disappointed. I grew up (and never really left) C-U, so the Ribeye will always hold a special place in my heart for its sentimental value. The decor hasn't changed in 20+ years, I'm sure. When you go in there, you feel like you are transported back to the 80s. However, the restaurant itself is very clean. The salad bar is my favorite -- always fresh, crisp and cold. I can't overstate the freshness -- you constantly see employees changing the salads. All of their salads and salad dressings, to my knowledge, are made in-house. I'm a huge fan of everything on that salad bar, especially the cucumber salad and the herring salad (but you just might have to be Eastern European to appreciate pickled herring with onions in mayo). For being a Ribeye lover, I actually don't like the steaks at the Ribeye. I really like thick-cut steaks cooked med rare, and you will never get anything below a med well steak at this place. However, the steaks are always juicy and full of flavor. They're served on a hot skillet (which I find questionable, but again, it's part of the experience). I always get the grilled chicken with extra barbecue sauce. It's seriously the best out there. I don't like twice-baked potatoes anyways, and their's is no exception. I usually order steak fries or rice pilaf.They have drinks, but they appeal more to the older crowd. No biggie for me, I usually order iced tea or wine anyways.I wouldn't say any food from the Ribeye is out of this world, but it is very, very good. The quality of the food and service is consistent. Go in with an open-mind. The Ribeye hasn't changed a bit in decades, and there's always a wait -- there's definitely a reason why they haven't changed. They do what they do very well.

<Content> Excellent local landmark restaurant. Love the salad bar! A modest but flavorful wine selection is available. I got the 10oz ribeye and it was a perfect medium rare. Service was good no real complaints there. If I had to say something negative it would be that there are way too many old people here!

<Content> Whenever you ask someone about The Ribeye, their response is the same: "the salad bar their is FABULOUS."When the best thing going for a steakhouse is its salad bar, this should be a red flag.The service is stiff and hurried, but efficient. The wine list is basically two choices: white or red. The menu is basically two choices: steak or chicken.The steak is a decent cut, but hardly seasoned and served on hot cast-iron skillets that mean your medium-rare steak is well by the end of your meal (and your medium well is a dried-out hockey puck of jerky-like ribeye.)All this while dining in a windowless cinder-block building decorated wholly in orange and blue, and surrounded by senior citizens (equally decorated wholly in orange and blue.)But yes, the salad bar is good.

<Content> I really don't get some of the reviews of this place. The salad bar is fabulous? Ok, you people need to get out of central Illinois more....So here's what this place is about. It is called The Ribeye and that is a perfect name for it. Just about the only thing you can order here is a ribeye. You can get an 8 oz ribeye, a 10 oz ribeye or a custom cut ribeye in any weight up to 32 ounces. But you can't get any other cut of meat. All ribeyes all the time. They do have I think one chicken and one shrimp dish available if you don't like ribeyes. So you better like ribeyes if you come to this place.Now to the salad bar. What is good about it? The fact that they have iceberg lettuce, cucumbers, croutons and 8 different mayonaisse based salads? The salad bar is terrible. Where are the mixed greens or spinach? What about garbanzo beans or sprouts or candied walnuts or jicama or edamame or anything remotely interesting? I find rural midwest cuisine sorely lacking in variety and this salad bar is just about as vanilla as it gets.Lack of menu choices, a terrible salad bar, baked potatoes that only come with butter and sour cream options (a steak restaurant should ALWAYS have baked potatoes that come with the options of chives, bacon, cheese and ALL of the fixings) and a pretty dingy interior all leave you pretty underwhelmed with this place. Unless you want a 32 ounce ribeye. Then they've got you covered!

<Content> was sadly disappointed.My medium rare steak was overdone, and hard to cut, but maybe its just the rib-eye cut? sadly no other steak cut options.The pickled beets and freashly baked slight deepfried bread are awesome. Other than that, I just wasn't really feeling the pasta and buckets of mayo salad bar.The decor is more than slightly dungeony from the moment you walk in.Menu options is basically rib eye and some insignificant chicken option and 3 pieces of shrimp for 20 bucks.However, the place was busy the whole evening, so they must be doing something right for others.

<Content> I myself can't recommend Ribeye for a meal, and gave it a low rating, roughly 1 1/2 stars. Because Ribeye has many happy customers, as well as fellow Yelpers who are fans, and who are marking Ribeye higher, I will try to describe Ribeye as well as I can as I relate my single dining experience. That way, you, the reader, will know what to expect if and when you go.Ambience and Decor:Let me first describe the restaurant's ambience. The restaurant is a dark, windowless interior space. The decor is simple, something like wood or wood-like tables and chairs along with booths. When I was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy. TV's were visible from most seats of our table, so watching a TV show or event while eating is part of Ribeye's draw. I imagine drinks and dinner while watching a football game would be an example. There is a full bar in a space connected to the dining area. Food:The food at Ribeye is not to my taste. The ribeye steak is low quality meat. Eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience. Perhaps a hamburger or meatloaf type order would be safer. Ribs are on the menu but I just know that the barbecue sauce would not be better, and might be worse, than that offered by McDonalds.The salad bar comes with most dinners. The salad bar has a mediocre selection of items, and the quality of each item is basic. Coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli. Freshness of the salad bar is variable by item, depending upon how it turns over. Overall, the salad bar is not worth ordering. It just is not very good.Bread is a hot, fresh loaf, but mediocre nonetheless. Also, Ribeye does something to its butter. The butter is whipped up for sure, but they might add sugar or something to it. The vegetables, and items like baked potato or mashed potatoes are edible, but mediocre. These don't appear to be prepared to order. Unfortunately, potatoes and vegetables lose much of their appeal if they are not eaten when freshly cooked to order.I can't comment on dessert. None of us ordered dessert, and I don't remember what was on the dessert menu.Summary:Overall, Ribeye leaves me with the impression of being an upgraded (albeit, a much upgraded) version of Sizzler. It also has the feel of a sports bar. Prices are pretty much in line with what Ribeye offers. That is, prices are neither too high nor are they particularly good values. Service is adequate but unremarkable either way.For me, this all is about 1 1/2 stars on Yelp. Ribeye is targeted to, and evidently, successfully fills, its own niche in the market. The other reviewers have different opinions, but all of us are evaluating the product that I have tried to describe to you above, in my review. I hope this will give you some idea of what to expect if you visit Ribeye.

<Content> The decor seems like it's stuck in the 80's or 90's.. the service is decent. I am not actually a huge fan of the ribeye steaks. They put them on this hot plate so even if you order a steak that is rare.. it comes out medium rare. I kind of wish they offered some other cuts of beef. I think they do offer breaded fried shrimp if you don't want ribeye.I do think their salad bar ROCKS. It's really clean and have interesting salads there (as well as build your own). Plus, all their veggies are defrosted properly. I hate going to a salad bar and seeing the peas clumped together like an ice cube.

<Content> The Rib Eye is solid and unpretentious. You come for meat, you will get meat. If you are on a college student budget, it might be a good place to go with your parents. Personally I like it better when I'm not picking up the bill.The main dishes are right there in the name - different sizes of rib eye. I'd heard great things about the salad bar, and it is pretty good. There's a lot of x salads - pasta salad, bean salad, egg salad offerings. The vegetables are reasonably fresh and there's a fair amount of toppings. Even so, this is not a good place for a vegetarian. My girlfriend's family took us out to eat here and one of her sister's friends was a vegetarian. She had very little luck with the menu and I think had to get the salad bar only. The rib-eyes are meaty and well cooked, not too overseasoned. They come out on a hot metal plate that will continue to cook them a bit as you eat. I have ordered rare steaks each time I've been there, and they actually brought out properly rare (chill in the middle and bright red) so I didn't mind too much. It was moist and delicious. The steak fries are big and crispy but just a little bland to me. The price does seem a bit high to me when paying, and the decor is absolutely outdated. A lot of the popularity of this place is rooted in nostalgia, I think, but it delivers the Rib eyes it promises.

<Content> I will concur with the other reviewers that the decor is completely drab and dull however, I really enjoyed my meal last night. We arrived around 4:15. Noticed there were quite a few people already there. We were told they would let us have a table as long as we could eat and be done by 6:00. That not being a problem we were promptly seated. My daughter and I usually share a meal and I asked our server if that would be OK. She told me that the kids buffet was only $3.00 so we opted for that. And she certainly ate her worth of $3.00 salad bar and more. When will it stop snowing here????? Anyway, I ordered the 10 oz. Ribeye medium. When it came out on the sizzling skillet it was more like well done. It was hard to cut and totally dried out. My server noticed that I wasn't happy and offered to get another one. I am not one of those people who likes to send food back to the kitchen for obvious reasons but this time I did. She brought me back that best Ribeye I have had in a very long time. When I cut into it bleed and that grosses me out but here the skillet is still cooking the steak and therefore it was soon medium and perfect!! So, my advice would be to order your steak under what you would at other steakhouses. They make the ranch dressing and that is always a plus in my book. The salad bar was good. They have real bacon bits. That along with homemade ranch dressing is the best in my book!! By the time we left there were so many people waiting to get a table it was crazy. I advise go early (they open at 4:00) or make reservations.Yes, they only offer Ribeye steaks. No deceiving there. Hence their name,

The only thing I don't like is that you have to wait if you don't make it there on time when they open, the lines are so long.But I guess it is worth it. I normal don't eat steak but that steak and the chicken is good.I also have a glass of wine with my dinner that is very delicious.

<Content> After hearing rave reviews of The Ribeye, I decided I would like to try this place. I was surprised that the restaurant was only open 5 and half hours every day and close by 9 or 9:30 every night. Weird concept for me... they would definitely receive more business by staying open a little later. We did not make a reservation and walked in. Quoting us a 20-25 minute wait while there were four open tables to be seen we decided to wait and eat here. Seeing we were not leaving, the hostess seated us within 8 minutes. This was a Friday evening.Our waitress was extremely pleasant and took great care of us. We ordered a beer on tap and of course, the ribeye. Ribeye comes with choice of baked potato, steak fries, or rice and each couple gets a loaf of bread. Salad bar is free if you order an entree. The salad bar was great, but way too small. It had plenty of food but it was crowded with a lot of people on both sides reaching everywhere. It needs a different spot in the restaurant. I ordered the 8 oz. ribeye while my husband ordered the 12 oz. It was a good cut of meat and well-aged but it was just good. I expected my mind to be blown, but it was just a good cut of steak. With two steaks and two beers our bill was $55. The restaurant looks like something from the 70s... very odd, but comforting in a way.

<Content> As a big fan of the Ribeye, I have one piece of advice - if you plan to go on a Friday night, or after any Illini basketball, football, volleyball, or other popular sport game, make sure to call in reservations before you go. I've had 15 minute waits even with a reservation, and 45 minutes plus without. I don't believe they take any reservations on Saturday, so expect a wait.Ambiance/decor isn't the best, sure, but it serves its purpose. The clientele is comprised largely of older Illini fans, so it works for the Ribeye to have pictures of Illini teams from their glory days. The service here is fantastic. The servers are professional, polite, friendly, and attentive without being overbearing. About the food... Well, when you go to a place called "The Ribeye," you should probably be in the market for a ribeye. Sure, there's chicken and shrimp, but the ribeye is their pice de rsistance. Honestly, when I started going to the Ribeye around 5 years ago, I feel like the steaks used to be higher quality, which is what keeps me from giving them a 5. Still, the ribeye is brought out on a hot cast-iron skillet/plate, and that sizzle alone can make my mouth water. I recommend either ordering one degree of cooking lower than your normal preference (i.e., if you like medium-rare steaks, order rare) to compensate, or eat your steak as soon as it's served. The highlight for me, however, is the salad bar. There's iceburg lettuce and the standard salad toppings to make your own, or an array of pasta, bean and potato salads (most of which are, indeed, covered in mayonnaise). My personal favorite is comprised of green peas, peanuts, cheddar cheese, bacon and ranch dressing. Is it haute cuisine? No. But it is solid, simple, and delicious. Also awesome - the croutons, made from the leftovers from the fresh French or wheat bread brought to your table.The price isn't terrible. Two people with soft drinks and before tip comes out to $42. The Ribeye isn't world-class, five-star dining, but it does offer good steaks, great salad options, and pleasant service.

<Content> This is a place you only go to for one reason - steak. That said, it's pretty good, and the salad bar is quite good. Expect throngs of locals, esp. around athletic event times. The place is full of Illini regalia and probably hasn't been updated decor-wise since the 70's. Sadly, most of their constituency wouldn't care or notice.

<Content> Okay, I don't know what the deal is with the reviews of this restaurant but I was in Champaign on business for a day and stayed at a nearby hotel and was referred to try the Ribeye because of its local flare. I have eaten at top rated (over priced) steakhouses and I was in the mood for some good midwest beef and something on the 'local' side. I had a GREAT dinner experience. I really enjoyed the ambiance of the place, the U of I memorabillia is very cool (I am a sports fan) and it has a nice feel to it. The service was more than attentive. Had a really nice glass of wine. Ordered the Ribeye dinner, medium rare and it came with bread, salad bar and baked potato. All for under $20, food only. I travel, try to get this anywhere - you won't find it. The salad bar is nice, for me not that big of a deal. The little loaf of bread is a nice touch. But when the steak and potato arrived on a sizzling hot plate, oh yeah this is what I wanted after traveling all day. I ordered the steak medium rare and I will have to say that it was cooked to PERFECTION. Just the way I wanted it. The potato was tasty and large and I just sat back and enjoyed a very nice meal. I would definitely eat here again, I would recommend others to do the same.

<Content> worst. steak. ever.Why oh why can't we rate zero stars?! Or better still, negative stars!Update: Had to go again because my aunt is insane. Knowing how bad the steak is, I ordered the shrimp. 10 times worse than the steak. The salad bar that people rave about? Laughably bad. Seriously, have you never been outside of Champaign and seen a real salad bar? Hell, even the Courier Cafe in Urbana has a better salad bar!Our waitress--and I wish I could remember her name-- was excellent, but she couldn't save the meal.DISGUSTING.

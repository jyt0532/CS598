<Content> While I typically like Burger King's burgers, the customer service at this location is a nightmare. I rarely frequent this location just because of their awful attitudes. I don't need to pay people to treat me like I'm bothering them to do their jobs.

<Content> Quite possibly the worst Burger King in town. The service is fairly average, but the food is far below average. As soon as I got home and ate my food, it tasted stale and cold.

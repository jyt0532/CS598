<Content> Here is an update to my previous review.I complained this issue to the Domino Pizza HQ and they contact the Store's General Manager, who promised me that when I was ready to place a new order, give me several coupons. I turned out that when I placed new orderings, the service has not been improved a lot and there is no coupons at all.~

<Content> This particular franchise seems to produce significantly lower quality food compared to the other Dominos locations in town, and that's a shame for U of I students living nearby. The whole store is also small and terribly cramped, and the employees range from just mediocre to wholly incompetent.

<Content> The quality of food is okay, just so so. But the best is that it is very cheap and super quick. No need to wait. Also close to my department

<Content> I always get the same thing: veg lo mein and an egg roll, and I tried the wonton soup once. Everything is mediocre and sometimes unpleasant to eat, but you get what you paid for. Out of the four times I went there I got one undercooked eggroll (frozen in the middle), one oil-dripping eggroll, two good eggrolls, 3 out of 4 times the lo mein was tasty but the last time I got it tasted gross (like it had been refrigerated for a while). The wonton soup was too salty and the wonton are the same that you expect fried (not the thin translucent dumplings). I'm going to find another place, but unfortunately this one is the only one in southeast Urbana :(

<Content> Just another one of those takeout places... that ROCK.Their salt'n pepper squid is delicious and their combination noodle soup is what sets this place apart from many other takeout places in the area. I don't recall if the combination noodle soup is actually called that (Shi Jing Mien), but if you ask for the noodle soup with a mix of stuff in it, they'll know what you're talking about. :P

<Content> I'm definitely a fan of First Wok. Admittedly, I get the same thing every time: the pork egg foo young combination plate. For $5.95, you get delicious egg foo young, pork fried rice, and an egg roll, enough to feed you for two or three meals! Soooo good. I also like their crab rangoon, which is crisp and slightly sweet, different than many I've tasted.Maybe someday I'll branch out to try their beef with broccoli, soup, and angel hair specials? Everything looks and smells so good there!Note: This place doesn't accept credit cards, so be sure you have cash before you order!

<Content> I thought this place was pretty average as far as Chinese food goes. Decided to try it out because other reviewers mention the plethora of vegetarian options. On the menu itself there are no more vegetarian options than most Chinese places offer. However, they will vegetarian-ize most of the meat dishes (I got General Tso's Tofu).That said, it was not the greatest tofu I've had--kind of mushy, sauce was a bit watery (...or oily...honestly I couldn't tell which). It also was not spicy at all. I'm sure they'll make it spicier if you ask, so if you like your food spicy you should probably request it. My food tasted alright and was definitely a generous portion, plenty for leftovers.Service was quick and the place looked clean. The food was just very...average.

<Content> Little disappointed here, Chambana Yelpers! I read some awesome reviews for First Wok, and Husband and I were super excited to try it out. We ended up there for lunch yesterday.So, first thing - their fried rice is saffron yellow.. but I guarantee there's no saffron in there. Ack. It's seriously neon.I ordered the eggplant chicken special. I was very excited after recently having some excellent garlic eggplant from Green Jade. I thought, "Yay! Eggplant Special! Happy Grace!" As it turns out, I celebrated a bit too soon. The eggplant wasn't thoroughly cooked, making it sort of bitter and tough. Also, they didn't use Chinese eggplant, which was sort of confusing. It was American (globe) eggplant. If it had been Chinese eggplant, I bet it would've tasted a whole lot better. Furthermore, it was advertised as 'spicy.' Ahem. That dish was not spicy in the least. It could've used a few hearty splashes of sriracha. (Coincidentally, that's what I plan to do to the leftovers...)I also got egg-drop soup, which was alright. However, I got some fried noodles with my soup, and was even further disappointed. They were stale and not very good. On the plus side, Husband's duck and broccoli special tasted excellent! The duck wasn't deboned in the least, and seemed like it had just been hacked apart, but after working around the bones, the taste rocked.The service was fast and friendly enough, and the prices were very low - both of us got specials and I got my soup for $12 total. Still, I don't think I'll be back. There are better Chinese food places in C-U.

<Content> General Tso's Chicken is one of my favorite dishes, and this place has the best General Tso's I've ever tasted. You also get A LOT for what you pay. I often end up eating my leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day. Their crab ragoon is so good - fried to a crisp, filled full. It is always warm with cool, gooey cream cheese in the center. Even their egg rolls are some of the best I've ever had.The only thing that bothers me (the food is so good, though, I don't even care) is the language barrier. No matter how I phrase it, I always end up with different portions/variations on my dish. I have never gotten the same thing there twice or paid the same price twice. You always get A TON of whatever entree you order, but sometimes you get a small order of rice, sometimes you get a large. Sometimes it's fried rice, whether you say fried or not, and sometimes, you get an egg roll, whether you ask for it or not. So if you think that will bug you, maybe the place isn't for you, but this place has some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. The price is always great for a poor student like me, too; a great Friday night date, Wok take out and a movie on Netflix.

<Content> I called in my order and it was done by the time I got there about 10 minutes later. Very fast and efficient- It's fast Chinese food but it's better than the Panda Express type places. I enjoyed the crab rangoon especially. Make sure to ask for sweet and sour sauce if you order the crab rangoons as it is not assumed.

<Content> Food at First Wok is delicious and comes in a large portion. My favorite dish is "House Special Angel Hair" that comes with shrimp, chicken, and bbq pork. I also love "General Tso's Chicken" because the chicken is crispy and the sauce is just well-balanced.Just call before leaving home, and never have to wait upon arrival. Great value!

<Content> I'm so glad Yelp has added verbal descriptions for the star system as, "Meh. I've experienced better." perfectly sums up my feelings. I got something marked "spicy" on the menu and barely felt any heat, nor tasted any seasoning. It wasn't a terrible experience, but judging from many of the other reviews here, I expected better.**Update** So I gave the place a 2nd try (orange chicken) a few months ago which didn't turn out to be that bad, not great, but not bad. I went there again today, ordered the szechuan chicken and was very dissapointed. Yet again, supposed to be spicy, yet just tasted like MSG gravy, no flavor, no spice, just umami and cornstarch. I'm guessing that there are probably dishes that aren't bad, but so far, all I've gotten was bland. That coupled with the abrupt, bordering on rude woman who works the front desk and I'm not sure if I want to find out what those decent dishes are.

<Content> This place is awesome.It's tucked away next to the County Market in Urbana (I drove around looking for it and almost missed it), and it was hopping when I was there (I think a Thursday evening around 6 or 7). They have a full takeout menu and then on the side of the wall they've stapled cardboard to the wall and written specials on it. I don't know how often these change, but they are very reasonably priced ($4-6 and come with rice). I ordered the subgum wonton soup and the hunan vegetables (special). The subgum wonton soup was huge and had vegetables, plump wontons, the most tender white meat chicken I've ever had, slices of roast pork, and big succulent shrimp. The broth was very nicely flavored and I will definitely get it again. The hunan vegetables had snow peas, baby corn, water chestnuts, carrots, broccoli, peppers, and tofu in the delectable hunan sauce (my favorite). This food fed me for two meals, and could feed anyone with a normal appetite more. I will be back many many times.

<Content> There was a First Wok where I used to live and the Beef and Broccoli combo was my favorite! When i moved here I was so happy to see a First Wok! The Beef and Broccoli wasn't as good as the one I was used to but the egg rolls are freakin' awesome. The General Tso's was really good here also! Cheap, quick, and delicious if you get the right thing!

<Content> OMG! When it comes to Chinese takeout there is no better. I cannot count the number of times I have sat in some posh Chinese restaurant in LA fantasizing about First Wok. They have a ton of options (healthy too) and will customize your dish to your liking. Everything is good! Definitely try it!

<Content> The perfect Chinese take-out restaurant needs to be three things: fast, simple, and consistent in its deliciousness. First Wok meets all three.Speed is key. I live a few blocks away, and when I make the decision to get Chinese food, I want that Chinese food right then. First Wok is spectacular in this regard. One call, a quick run-through of the items I want, and it's done. This isn't the place you all if you want to hmm and hah through the options. I've found it best to have everything planned out. Usually they'll list your order back to you, but sometimes they won't. Sometimes they'll tell you "ten, fifteen minutes," but most of the time they won't. But you'll show up fifteen minutes later and your food will be ready to go.And that food will be delicious. I always order the cashew chicken, the beef with broccoli, the beef lo mein, and some hot and sour soup. They're all magnificent, in that greasy, inexpensive take-out way, and they're all good reheated for days and days.On the downside, I will note that I have had the smallest of mistakes in my orders. Once they left out the crunchy things that go on the soup. Another time they game me a small item when I had ordered a large. Nothing major, I was never overcharged, and these are the only such occurrences in close to three years of regular patronage. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

<Content> I just realized that I have been eating here for years, driving from the other side of town even, but I had never written a review. Well here it is. I have gotten food from First Wok for the last 8 or 9 years, on a regular basis, and I can't remember a time where I was not happy. I lived in Chicago for 6 years, but came back to visit family a lot and always made sure to get it while I was here. The pot stickers are like 4 or 5 bucks and they are enough for a meal for one. They have your typical fried appetizers and they are not greasy. I am not going to try to remember every dinner or lunch that I have ordered, but they were all good. It is totally worth going to sunnycrest to get it.

<Content> This is our go-to take-out place while Cravings is down for the count. They're great for the value, and their food is really tasty. It's your standard Chinese take-out...not too much to say about that! Their egg rolls are a little dry, but overall its a tasty choice for this part of town.

<Content> Fast service, good prices, clean, and the food seems good. Of course, I'm no expert on Chinese food. I have heard people rave about Italian restaurants that I, as an Italian, find lacking; so I suspect that someone of Chinese ancestry might think First Wok falls short. Take that as a caveat. Anyway, I like their egg rolls and boiled dumplings. The crab rangoons don't impress. Their hot and sour soup is good. Gentle kick to it. I often get Pork Lo Mein and enjoy that. Servings are ample. The General Tsao Chicken is good, as are all the entrees I have tried. The usual unappetizing photos of their dishes adorn the wall. I often wonder about those photos. A friend living in Taiwan sent me a cookbook that was popular there and it contained the same quality photos of the food. Curious. The menu lists a plethora of items and the wall has posted another list of dozens of entrees. What these all are escapes me and there is often a language barrier when asking for an explanation. Sometimes I feel adventurous and plan to order something I never had before but I always end up going with something familiar. For a sit-down dinner, I prefer Rainbow Gardens on Neil Street, but for a quick and satisfying Chinese dinner, First Wok should not disappoint.

<Content> Worst service ever!!!! This was my first time ordering from first wok. When I called to place my order, as soon as I finished ordering what I wanted, they hung up! They never told me how long, said thank you or anything. When I went to pick it up, I was the only customer there and they acted so rude. They also got my order completely wrong. I ordered a pint of beef Lo mien and a small generals tso's chicken. When I picked up my order I got chicken Lo mien (not beef) and a large combo generals tso's chicken with rice and was way over charged. The white rice was disgusting and everything was not as good as everyone has said on here. Definitely not coming back. I'll drive the extra distance to get good Chinese for the same/cheaper price with great service.

<Content> Came here for a conference and got to enjoy the reception here at the on site restaurant. Great wings, pizza, spinach dip, and fried mushrooms. Also great service at the bar! The bar tenders were extremely accommodating and found chargers for my friend and I (with different phones) after ours had died.I would say 5 for service, and 3 for food.

<Content> Came here with a party of 15 (we had a reservation). They were completely unprepared for us. We arrived at 7 and they first tried to seat us at a table for 8. They then moved us to the bar area and sat us on 4 different round high top tables. Whatever, we can make that work.We all ordered our drinks and it took over 20 minutes for them to all be delivered. Mind you, many of us just ordered water to start with as we were going to be going out afterwards. 20 minutes is just insane to wait for water!Another 20 minutes goes by and our waiter (who's name I never caught) FINALLY came to take our orders. We knew it would take awhile for our food so we all sat and chatted. Food finally started coming out and as it came out he had no idea who ordered what, so we had to figure out what was on the plate and who ordered it. My food was alright, though at first it didn't come with the potato's that I ordered. Instead of just bringing me a side, he took my entire plate back and came back with mashed potato's very haphazardly placed on the side.One of our diners didn't get their food until almost everyone had already eaten. She ordered chicken tenders...they aren't that difficult to make!So up until this point we were all a bit peeved but could deal with it.The real disaster hit when he went to give us our tickets. Out of 15 checks, only 2 of them were right. He charged a pregnant lady 2 alcoholic beverages! It's not like he just gave her the wrong ticket, she was the only one that ordered what she got! So he just had no idea who ordered what.I got my check and it had an iced tea on it that I didn't order. He took my check to take it off and I didn't get a new check for another 30 minutes. I almost walked out without paying because we were getting tired of waiting, but I'm an honest person and I wouldn't have felt right leaving without paying.FINALLY the manager came out to assist him. Why wasn't she there the entire time? I have no idea! But she was about as much help as a log. She apologized, of course. But did we get any sort of compensation? Nope. She did decide to send the person that the party was in honor of a gift card to come back. Something tells me that gift card will go unused. I know I will never return to this establishment.Why was that poor waiter left on his own with a party of 15? Why didn't ANYONE help him? I saw at least 3 or 4 waiters pass by our table and not a single one of them thought that maybe he was struggling. Now, don't get me wrong...our waiter was about as personable as a stick in the mud, but still...we couldn't help but feel sorry for him, he obviously had no support from management.Get it together, Houlihan's. If you can't handle a 15 top, don't allow them. I doubt ANY of us will ever return to your establishment. And you really put a damper on what was supposed to be a really awesome night for our bride-to-be.

<Content> This is not the Houlihan's of my childhood! This is a classy, someone expensive, upscale establishment. With 4 adults and 2 toddlers, we were seated (thankfully) away from all the other guests (it was early maybe just 5p so there was a lot of extra space). The food was good and the staff was friendly and helpful. I don't live in the area, but if I did, I would be adding this to my list of go-to places for when company is in town.

<Content> I've been here on numerous occasions. At least 6 times. It's a convenient location and I always think my bad experiences are a fluke. I've come for brunch once, that was a bust. My other visits are during dinner. Of all the dishes I've tried, the worst was the veggie burger. Cold white rice with a few black beans thrown in and shaped into a patty.I'd prefer a bowl of cereal at home over this place. Hands down.

<Content> Fantastic dinner last night. Seared ahi tuna and calamari for apps, scallops and stuffed chicken for dinner. The food was very good. I expected to wait much longer than we did for food since the campus was flooded with marathon runners. In and out in about an hour. My only complaint is with the service. Our waiter looked like he had just rolled out of bed and was annoyed he had to work. By the end of the meal we were finally able to get one smile out of him. Will definitely be back!

<Content> I actually think this place is decent for a nicer version of TGI Friday. Service was good. Food was nicely decorated and tasted good. I got the filet mignon which was good but it wasn't worth 22 bucks. my friends on the other hand got fish tacos and they all liked it ($10). we got Bruschetta(?) for appetizer which was really good. Ambiance was cool. Decent (albeit expensive) drink menu. I mean, it's a fine dining version of TGI, what did you expect?Overall, I enjoyed my visit there. I would go back there again.

<Content> I agree with the first review...I get the feeling it is a step up from Friday's, but is a bit more trendy and refined. I was impressed nonetheless. The lighting was intimate and a great start to the evening of debauchery ahead.I had the herb-grilled chicken. Healthy, delicious. As a desert, my date and I split a creme brulee and a white chocolate banana cream pie. HEAVEN on my Houlihan's table!

<Content> Don't come here on game day because you'll get a "special event" menu and there isn't anything good on it. Yes this makes it easy for kitchen and staff, but it inconveniences the paying customer. Why even stay open. The service is ok, but you can tell some employees don't want to be here.Skip it on Illinois game days.

<Content> I stay at the IHotel for business often (bi-weekly) and have had dinner at Houlihan's on many occasions. This restaurant is very consistent. I haven't had a bad meal yet. The filet mignon with mashed potatoes hits the spot on a cold night in U-C. I'm pretty addicted to their Fat Spaghetti and Potstickers. Weird combo? Yes, but I crave them as soon as I check into the hotel. The waitstaff is excellent, but a couple of the hostesses could be a tad "warmer". Overall, this is great spot.

<Content> Sunday night we expected it to be slow, diners that is. However everything was slow. I ordered a filet mignon-medium rare and my wife ordered an almond crusted tilapia. We waited 30 minutes for our food and my filet was over cooked. It had no sear marks and appeared to be oven cooked. How do you mess up a steak? The tilapia was thickly crusted with something, with little specks of what may have been almonds. I asked to have my steak redone and to their credit they obliged, agreeing it was not done correctly. As my wife picked the mystery crust off her fish, my steak was redone. The second steak appeared promising (sear marks visible), but the cook obviously did not time or let the steak rest because this time it was rare (raw). Now I enjoy med rare bloody, but not cold raw steak. We had enough. Asked for a doggy bag and may give my dog a once in a lifetime treat.

<Content> If you're vegan, stay away.If you're strict about your vegetarianism, stay away.If you have any dietary restrictions, stay away.Unless you enjoy repeated occurrences of:1) "Without bacon please"2) Receiving bacon on sandwich3) Having the kitchen take the bacon off but return the same sandwich still covered in bacon grease. Not really what I had in mind... Alternating visits yield either:1) "Oatmeal is made with water"2) "Oatmeal is made with milk"So either they change their recipe really often or the staff have no idea what's going on. Vegan breakfast option: Cup o' fruit"Vegetarian" breakfast options: You've been warned.

<Content> We had a medium sized party on a tight lunch schedule, so meals were preordered to save time. The waiter never introduced himself, never asked when our wholeParty had arrived and we had to ask for our meals which arrived at 12:45. Just about 5 minutes to eat before heading back to work. The others in the party said they could be a few minutes late so they were able to "enjoy" their food. I give quotes because I think my dish was terrible. Im not sure what the others thought but there were no oohs and aahs.I ordered the scallops which were small, way over cooked, and made me sick about a 1/2 hour later. This is a major disappointment to be so bad when there is so much potential and talent in this town.

<Content> They have changed the fish tacos and I do not like them as well as I did before. If you sign up on Houlihan's website they send you a coupon on your birthday for a free entree up to $15.00. I went today and ordered the Tao Chipolte turkey wrap with chips and salsa and french onion soup. The wrap wasn't bad. It had good flavor but the wrap itself was dry so it crumbled some. The french onion soup was really good and the chips and salsa were OK. All in all it was a good free meal. The server was attentive and the atmosphere pleasant. Very clean and chic.

I received an answer promptly and was accommodated. Service was great and friendly. Our party enjoyed chicken parm, fish tacos and the chicken wraps. All were very tasty.  My contact via email, Sam, came over to our table and checked how things were going.  We all enjoyed our experience and will be back. Thanks to Sam and Pete for going out of their way to make our dining experience a pleasant one!

<Content> The manager was the rudest person we have ever met. Went in there last Friday night with 6 other people and we walked into the bar and grabbed a table that was open. He walked over and started to berate our group for not checking in at the hostess stand. Then he proceeded to slam down menu's for us and said in a rude tone "Here are your menu's" needless to say his lack of professionalism forces us to leave this horrible establishment. I will never go back there and will tell everyone else to never go there!

<Content> Houlihans constantly underwhelms me... and by constantly, I mean the two times I've gone there. I think that for the quality/taste of food, it's way over priced. I have had the SW chicken wrap, which mentions jalepenos, but I found it incredibly bland. My dad liked his sandwich... but it was like ham and cheese with mixed greens, it's not that hard.The decor is cool, I just think the prices are a little bit ridiculous for the quality of food in Champaign.

<Content> So here's the thing: after 4 times here the service has been consistently friendly but incompetent.For example, today I got sat in a nearly empty restaurant, and the host forgot to bring a menu. She said she'd bring one right back, and then forgot (I watched her stand at the host stand, bored). Took 5 minutes to get one from waiter. This is the kind of thing you'd forgive as a fluke, but you watch and see table-waiting basics being flubbed all over the place. Last time, I watched *three* different customers standing up and approach a waiter stand asking to find their waiter. My service was slow, and didn't anticipate common needs (like a coffee refill at breakfast).My food came out partially cold and partially hot, which is either a kitchen timing issue or a tardy waiter who left food sitting in the window too long.Seeing as it doesn't seem to be one bad server, I'd guess this the result of poor training--which is usually a management issue.If you can survive the service, the hip/classy atmosphere has rich dark wood, orange lighting, and attractive window bays looking at Memorial Stadium on the south tip of campus. The menu items I've had have been either decent or great.Worth a try, I suppose, but bring patience.

<Content> Houlihan's is kind of a pseudo fine dining version of a TGI Friday's. The menu is similar to what I would expect from TGI Friday's, but the decor is a lot more trendy right down to the super obnoxious aluminum menus. Although the menu items are fairly pedestrian, they have little twists (chevre on the bruschetta instead of the more expected mozzarella, for example) and there is a big focus on presentation. This makes for wonderful looking food, but the taste doesn't quite hit the mark. Some of the cool looking little food sculptures are also very difficult to eat. My bruschetta came with a little minced olive tower that looked like a cross between a wine cork and something out of the cat box, which was none to appetizing.Most of the food I had tasted OK, but the fried asparagus stands out as being notably bad. One of my pet peeves is tough asparagus, and the stuff here was enough to make me go postal. It was over breaded, over cooked, and the asparagus was actually chewy. Gross. I couldn't bite through the asparagus, so when I tried to eat it, the asparagus slid out of the breading leaving a pile of greasy panko straws on the plate. The horseradish dipping sauce was good, but lacked zing. At $10 for a dozen bad pieces of asparagus, this should definitely be skipped.As is usually the case with chains, the menu descriptions made the food sound divine but the taste did not live up to it. It's not bad, mind you, it's just forgettable. This was particularly the case with the "mini desserts," which are actually full sized desserts; one is plenty for two people. Thinking they were much smaller than they turned out to be, we got a $6 trio of pecan pie, banana cream pie, and chocolate cake. All were very cold as if they had just been removed from a long stay in the fridge. All were also very bland and had terrible texture. The pies were both runny, and the chocolate cake was dry and made Hostess cupcakes look gourmet. Like everything else, they looked fabulous, and were also very reasonably priced, but don't let that fool you. They're really not worth it. So overall, I give Houlihan's a resounding "meh." It's not bad, but I certainly didn't find it to be particularly good. I'm giving three stars because the service was better than I would expect from a newer place so close to campus, and they definitely deserve credit for having such a well trained and capable staff.

<Content> The service here is awful. Though I can't say it was all bad, our waitress was pretty awesome. She was on top of her shtuff. First off, we wanted to sit in the bar Saturday night to watch the Olympics but there was a wedding reception going on. Weird? Yes, but that's Illinois I guess. We waited around for at least five minutes before flagging another server down to finally get a table. I also gotta say, the drinks here (besides the long islands) are expensive! They're about twice as expensive as other/nicer Houlihan's I've been to. It must be because it's connected to the hotel. Anyways, the food was hit and miss. My bf ordered the panko shrimp. Everything was perfect and delicious except for the coleslaw, which was like shredded cabbage and mayo that had been mixed two seconds before so it wasn't marinated at all. I had the seared sea scallops. Sadly, the scallops were more like bay scallops. Pretty tiny in comparison to the same entree I got at a different location a few days earlier. At least they were perfectly cooked, since the risotto was a fail. It was starchy and unappetizing. Needless to say, I doubt I will be returning to this location though Houlihan's is one of my favorite restaurant chains.

<Content> I'm done with this place. I have been several times to this location always during lunch with varying results. Today a friend and I were seated in a bar booth without asking, although there were plenty of other places on the restaurant side. Our waitress was ridiculously slow. She actually got slower as lunch wore on although I only saw she had three tables to wait on. We were there from 11:50 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. for lunch in a near empty restaurant. Asked for our checks at 1:05 she said in a minute. 10 minutes later she brought them. We waited another 15 and she never came back to run our cards. We had to go to the hostess stand and get a manager to check us out. The food isn't that good to give this another chance. Won't go back, ever.

<Content> Staying at the iHotel for the second time in a month. Staff is very nice but the lunch from Houlihan's was very disappointing. The tomato bisque was acceptable (I would give it 3 stars) but the flatbread was absolutely horrible (0 stars) -- oily, doughy, wilted arugula with 0 taste, and I am pretty sure some of the mushrooms were past their prime. The flavor and texture of the flatbread made me wonder if it was pre-made and then just microwaved, there was nothing fresh about it.

<Content> If I could have given no stars I would. Worst restaurant experience in Chambana, again. Here for business lunch, group of 10. Out of veggie burgers, out of flatbreads, discovered both of these several minutes after placing first ordering. Waitress offered me the vegetarian alternative of a chicken salad; I explained to her that chickens are animals and murdered to be put in the salad. Wait staff has messed up more than one order, can't remember who order what, meals are coming out one at a time. My suggestion, avoid and go anywhere else.

<Content> Yum! That hit the spot! I wandered around campus for a good hour looking for a place to enjoy a nice meal and glass of wine but had no luck near the college, so I came back to the hotel where I am staying. I wanted a steak but thought the 8 oz filet was a little pricey and large so I settled on the 4 oz filet (and subbed fries for a house salad for $2). My steak was perfectly cooked and was served with a side of broccolini and a dab of buttery sauce for only $10!! The 8 oz fillet is only $25 and comes with sides and a salad so that's not a bad deal either. I also had breakfast here this morning and was very satisfied with my scrambled eggs and bacon. I would definitely recommend this place. I know it's my first review, but it's legit. :)

<Content> You expect a certain level of a quality when you go to a chain, that's why you go there. This Houlihan's doesn't measure up to others I've been to. The service was awful, we waited 20 minutes for our waitress to show up at the table. We then placed our order immediately so as to not wait even longer, and we saw her go to several other tables for very long minutes before even turning in our order. So we waited another 30 minutes to get our food, which was NOT worth the wait. I had the fish tacos, and the fish was dry and overcooked.  There are better places to eat in Champaign.

<Content> Visited once. Personally, I thought it was overpriced for the quality and quantity of food received, and the service was lackluster at best.Five of us went after work for drinks; we didn't expect to have dinner, but we were all a little hungry, so decided to get a light fare before some went out to a party later that evening. I don't drink alcohol, so I ordered lemonade ($2.50, and it was just ok - not very tangy), and a cup of their potato soup, and house salad with blue cheese (each $3.95). I can't believe they don't have light French dressing......this is criminal.I was disappointed that the server couldn't keep the salad orders straight; unfortunately, two of us ordered salads with white dressings; her's ranch, mine blue cheese (since there was no French dressing!). The other gal had to serve as 'taste tester' to determine which salad had ranch and which had blue cheese dressing.For $11.26 (plus my decent tip since I'm not usually bitchy unless the service is really really bad!) I don't think I will likely return to Houlihans on my own free will. If however, someone really wanted to meet me there, I might go for the company and stop at McD's on my way home.

The only downfall I feel this place has is the prices- but it's in a hotel, when's the last time you got anything for a normal price in a hotel? It's like buying hot tamales at the theater-

<Content> Make sure you order the grease on the side.  When I told our (clearly hungover) waitress that my grease-laden sandwich on stale bread was unacceptable, she took it back to the kitchen, where they clearly wiped it off with paper towels and threw it in the microwave before re-serving it to me. She barely apologized before taking it off the bill. Classy. The rest of my party's food was below average, as well. Don't waste your money here. just use the little iHotel vouchers at the coffee shop. It may not be as large a meal, but at least it won't take half an hour for a hungover waitress to bring you coffee.

<Content> Over a year passed since I had last stopped by Houlihan's. A friend recommended coming here for happy hour. Based on my prior experiences, I knew to keep my expectations low. Instead, I had a great time. I came back a few days later and had another pleasant meal. As far as chain restaurants go, Houlihan's ranks well above average. I've skimmed the other reviews, and I can't be sure if I've just been lucky, but I certainly didn't suffer the problems of other customers (e.g., bland food, poor service).Lunch options are generously portioned and reasonably priced. Complimentary soup or salad is served with entrees, sandwiches/wraps, and pizzas. I've tried the baked potato soup and chicken tortilla soup and have trouble picking a favorite; both are savory and very thick/hearty. If you're concerned about skimpy salads, each of the signature salads come with a healthy proportion of greens-to-"toppings" (candied pecans, Gorgonzola cheese, chicken, etc.).The tapas-style menu really makes this a fun spot for happy hour. There are a LOT of options here (more than 40+), ranging in size from small to medium to entree-size. You'll find something, even if you're a picky eater (and Houlihan's takes special consideration if you mention being gluten-intolerant, vegetarian/vegan, etc.). I love being able to pick out a few things to share with friends, but I can also see this as a great option if you have a light appetite and want truly modest portions of rich mashed potatoes or filling pasta. (Or if you have a diverse appetite and just want to eat bites of a lot of different things!) You can get small, "appetizer"-sized portions of their mac-and-cheese (yum!), grilled skewers, asparagus salad, and white bean hummus (DELISH). I eat hummus as an appetizer at many places, and while they vary in success, I found Houlihan's hummus with grilled pita to be plate-lickingly GOOD (surprising especially for a chain!).The other essential element for happy hour are drinks, and Houlihan's is stocked with a full bar, along with a menu of suggested cocktails. Some of these drinks are more sophisticated, compared to the corn-syrupy messes you get served at most chain restaurants. For women watching their weight, Houlihan's also serves a number of fruity drinks from the "Skinny Girl" brand (great for minimizing the damage that restaurants can do to your diet).

<Content> This is delicious! I had never been to a Houlihans before and it is great. At lunch I get the mini burgers and salad combo and it is great- a little pricey. If it was $7.95 or so I think that it would be a better deal but the food is really good. At dinner time they have a menu that included mac and cheese for $6 and it is GREAT!!!! This is a place worth going!!

<Content> stopped down here for a quick lunch. my friend and i ordered a few of the small plates to share which ended up being the perfect amount of food. we shared the bbq chicken flat bread pizza and the spinach dip appetizer. we also each got a cup of soup. i had the french onion, which was alright. the pizza was tasty and the dip was relatively light considering how heavy spinach dips can be sometimes.service was great. our waitress was very attentive.

<Content> What a neat little place! Amazing ambience. Of course, the place will really light up on a game day.They have got a good menu. A good selection of small plates (2-4 of these would be one meal) with very reasonable prices. A traditional selection of regular appetizers. The drink selection is great. They have pretty much everything on the menu but I dont know if they really have it behind the bar. The happy hours are very attractive. Not as much as other places but still great. We went for a dinner one evening. We were served by an apprentice waiter. She did a good job and the person over seeing her was very courteous and respectful too. They offered to correct our drink when we were not satisfied with the one we got. The beer selection is satisfying. The small plates are delicious and will leave you wanting more. But thats what they are designed to be. Delicious small portions. The sliders are tasty. The chicken is moist and tender. Great going so far.The entrees are a hit or miss. I particularly did not like my Salmon. It was tough, chewy and smelled a little. I do no like seafood when it smells of seafood. Yeah .. fresh seafood does not smell at all and feels tender yet firm when you cut it / chew. This one was definitely a miss. The grilled shrimp entree was good. The shrimp did not suffer the same fate as the salmon.Save room for desserts for sure! Good selection of individual desserts priced reasonably.Highly recommended for:happy hourssmall platesappetizersdessertsbar menuInconsistent about:entreesLooking forward to try their brunch!Watch out for:the happy hour listed on the site is no longer valid. They have a different happy hour configuration now.

<Content> We went here on Mom's weekend when campus and downtown were booked.  What an ice surprise. I had the best veggie burger I have eaten. Their own special recipe. The fish tacos got rave reviews and the ironic steak was very good. Service was excellent.  If they would switch their burgers to homemade and not frozen patties they would have had everyone at our table pleased. Also, the asian slaw and salad were super

<Content> An unexpected pleasure just south of the UIUC main campus. I agree with some others that this is an upscale version of TGIF. Burgers were good, price was fair, food was prepared correctly, and service was okay. I never pin my hopes too high on anything in this town (except for the outstanding academics), but as stated, my positive experience here is noteworthy.

<Content> I am staying at the IHotel, which is connected to Houlihans. I went down to put in a take out order, because there is no takeout menu in my room. They got my drink and gave me a menu at the bar, but never came back for my order. I was trying to make eye contact and waving the menu and my glass for awhile, then starting waving my arms in the air. Nothing. Granted, they were busy but I watched them wait on other people coming in while I got nothing. I felt like I was invisible!

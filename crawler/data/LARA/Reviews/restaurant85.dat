<Content> Po Boys is the place for BBQ and Pizza!!Its my opinion that you should combine both tasty delicacies and have the BBQ Pizza! The pulled pork pizza is out of this freakin world!!! If BBQ is more your style without the za' then you will be pleased to know that Po-Boys has 3 different BBQ sauces to choose from! The service is amazing and very attentive.... Oh and did I mention THE HOMEMADE PIE!Every time I stop in Urbana I always make sure to eat at at Po-Boys because its just that good!!!

<Content> No atmosphere. Unimpressive food. The pie (which they rave about) had a thick graham cracker crust that was disgusting. No real beer selection. Won't be back.

<Content> No thank you.The service at po'boys is nice, but the food was just...hideous. I went on a Sunday afternoon with a friend and we managed to choke down al the food in front of us and immediately regret it. The barbecue was just absolutely gross and the location itself was entirely lackluster. While I know it has its fans, I just can't do it, PB. I'm sorry.

<Content> REALLY love this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)Went with a bunch of my cousins and was able to try a bunch of thingsMy little 6 year old cousin LOVED the chili.. she ate more than she normally ever does! she shocked us allRibs were AMAZING! I got the hottest sauce cuz that's who I am but still mouthwateringMy 18 year old cousin finished the pork bbq in about 4.5 seconds flat.. no joke.. inhaled.. and then helped his dad on his huge pizza... My cousin's wife ate all of her pork tenderloin and I really didn't think she would.. just lots of food!My 11 year old cousin who is picky in eating insisted in bringing home the leftover and the sauces.. when her mom asked why she brought home the sauces she responded with "the ranch and honey mustard they gave us are better than what we have in the fridge"family owned.. much love.. fast service and great food.. please do yourself the justice and go here!!! DELICIOUS!!!!!! :)

<Content> Probably one of the worst dining experiences. The food is not good. Everything is pre-made or previously frozen. My bf and I shared the mozzarella sticks. He swore they were from Aldi's. He then had a bbq sandwich, while I tried out the shrimp po'boy. My bread was super chewy and unedible. I think it was microwaved, it was warm but dried out. Also, the shrimp were cut up into smaller pieces, so I had 3 whole shrimp at max on my sandwich. It was ridiculous. They also charge for extra sauces. That's only annoying because it's not spelled out on the menu.They have a full bar, but not specials. Well that's gonna attract customers. The staff seemed pretty incompetent as it took forever just to get our drinks.

<Content> This is the old OTB on High Cross with the softball fields/sand volleyball courts and is half-bar, half restaurant/banquet area. I have been only once since they changed ownership.I hear that they have good food, mostly reminiscent of the apparently hallowed former Chambana institution of the same name. The word is the current owners bought recipes from the family that ran the old Po' Boys. Next time, I'll try the BBQ.When I went (in winter), I had beers and a fried cheesecake with jelly syrup and ice cream dessert in a martini glass. It was really good. Service was also good. Beer selection was pretty good, about a half-dozen of the usual suspects on tap with a better selection in bottles, although the prices were kinda high.The room on the right seems perfect to rent out for a medium to large size gathering. I have been a over the summer to watch folks play sports (when it was still the OTB), and it is pretty good for that. Decent prices on light beer in bottles.All in all, this place is merely average at best, with prices a little higher than I would expect. If you live out in the country and this is the closest place to you, I can see it being your go-to place, especially to watch sports. If you live in central Chambana, dont have a softball or volleyball game there, and are not a BBQophile, you have no reason to go to Po' Boys.

<Content> LOVE THIS PLACE!!The food here is the best! Everything I eaten there was great, the BBQ, the pizza, all of it.Plus, the restaurant is HUGE, lots of fun stuff to do there besides eat. There's video games, billiards, and they have live music and karaoke.Out back there's batting cages, softball, and volley ball.The staff that work there are always nice, all really great people. I can't wait to go back!

<Content> I was unfortunate enough to come here, not of my own decision. I sat through an hour of slow service, terrible food, and noisy children. I walked out to my car across the fake grass as fast as I could.

<Content> The waiting staff is incredibly rude.I am part of a softball league that plays at their fields, and our league brings in thousands of dollars worth of business every year for them. One player brought food in from another restaurant. He then went to the bar to buy beer from Po'Boys. While he was waiting to be served (expect to wait), another waiter came up and rudely commanded that the food must leave immediately. After informing him that the food belonged to a person at the bar, the waiter forcefully attempted to throw it away. Only after pulling the food away from the waiter did he relent. Even then he swore at us. With no tact and incredible rudeness from the waiting staff, this bar is not worth the trouble of the drive. I highly recommend any of the more courteous and better tasting restaurants and bars in Champaign-Urbana.

<Content> I have been to Po-Boys a few times and think it's amazing! As a vegetarian I have not been disappointed by the salad bar or pizza. We have gone as a large group and everyone was very happy with their meal and the staff is super friendly! I highly recommend you check this place out!

PIES! PIES!i had the banana/strawberry on a graham cracker crust, while Lisa had one called "Millionaires Pie" (ingredients unknown).we like the pie so much, we bought carry out two days later for more.the pecan, peach/blueberry, Millionaire, banana/strawberry were all very good.save your fork, there's PIE!!!yeah, we'll be back and try the pizza next.

<Content> PoBoys is great!!I had the Pulled pork pizza with the original BBQ sauce, I wasn't sure how pulled pork on Pizza would be and I was very happy with my decision, the pizza was GREAT!Someone else at my table ordered a mixed BBQ sampler- GOOD. BBQ Sauce has a good balance of sweet and spicy.What really sold me was the salad bar, I love to add my own fixins to my salad, this is key for me. The other big seller for me...homemade PIE...amazing. We were too full to actually eat the pie in the restaurant so we took 3 slices home, yes 3, and all were amazing.Service:I went on a Friday afternoon for lunch.I was seated quickly and had a water and drink from the bar in a few minutes. My order was taken quickly and our food came out soon after. Support a family-owned small business over a chain restaurant.

<Content> Staff are friendly, I really like this place. Staff are very knowledgeable with regard to allergies. I have an issue with gluten and the staff take precautions. I like the smoked half chicken and BBQ beans.

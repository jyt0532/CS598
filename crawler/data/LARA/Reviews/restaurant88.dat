<Content> I have been to Panera several times. The broccoli cheese soup and french onion soup are the best,. However, I have never had a good apple from Panera. EVER. They are always tasteless and thick skinned. I am not sure where they get their apples from but it might not be bad idea to shop around and have someone with taste buds pick the apples.The Sierra turkey is a really good Cafe sandwich but the onions on it are a bit hot and strong. I picked them off. The Chipolte mayo was a little spicy but added great flavor to the sandwich. It comes on Asiago cheese focaccia which I probably would have picked a different bread. I have tried other sandwiches and I have liked most of them.I tried one of the new pasta dishes the other day and was not overly impressed. But I am not a pasta person.I went through the drive through for the first time today and I was really impressed with how quickly I got in and out of it. It seems you wait longer for you food when you dine in.

<Content> I have gone to Panera for YEARS and usually they are top notch and reliable....This location, however, is not. Before I put my review, let me say that I have had to contact corporate TWICE to try and see any type of resolve...Let's hope this second time will actually work... I have gone to the same Panera for the past three days and apparently they do not feel the need to pay attention to detail to those in the drive thru. The first two days, I ordered exactly a large black iced tea with a cinnamon roll heated up. The first day, they heated up and placed it inside the bag without a box, completely unsanitary. The second day, they said "we don't heat up cinnamon rolls here." I had to in fact inform the employee that they did heat cinnamon rolls, however, yet again, my cinnamon roll was thrown into a bag with my napkins and such thrown on top. The third day took the cake. I decided to spell it out for them because clearly they did not understand that a cinnamon, like any other pastry, goes in a box. So, I ordered a large black iced tea with a cinnamon roll heated up in a box. And what did I get? A cinnamon roll, in a bag, not heated up. The customer service here is beyond poor. Upper management needs to step in because clearly the management at the store is not providing proper training.

<Content> Panera is usually a pretty reliable place to stop when traveling, but this location left much to be desired. The person who waited on us was not friendly at all; a smile or a "hi" would have been nice. The food wasn't up to par, either There was one small dot of chipotle mayo on my Sierra turkey; guess they were rationing condiments that morning. The pricing structure on the You Pick Two has changed, now each thing is individually priced . Our lunch was over $18; we drink water.....pretty pricey for a half sandwich with a salad or soup. Bathroom needed some work as well. Won't be back here.

<Content> It's a chain, but a damn friendly one, filled with soup and delicious sandwiches, topped off by hot coffee and free wi-fi. Great spot.However, just a word of warning. If you're there to take a breather and collect yourself, avoid move-in week. Stressed soccer moms with their soon to be inebriated freshmen children do not help keep one's sanity in the newly packed environment.That said, great job, Panera for giving us grad students free wifi and great food. Excellent.

<Content> 16 minute wait in drive thru with only 2 cars in front of me. The guy made me repeat my order twice cause he said he forgot for my 2  items. Car in front of me was asked to move up he waited 6 mins and gave up he did not even wait for the coffee he paid for. Took them 5 mins to just acknowledge me at the window. Got my sandwich and he asked if I wanted cream and sugar I said yes. And now I'm drinking black coffee.

<Content> The worst Panera I have ever been to. One of the worst places in the C-U. We went there to get some bread, and stood in line for 5 minutes while receiving awkward looks from their employees. No one came to help us or take our order. There must have been at least 10 employees standing around, doing absolutely nothing, ignoring us. It was so bad we left, along with the other customers behind us. Do not waste your time at an establishment that cannot be bothered to take your money.

<Content> Less than full soup and no replacements as promised. 5$ a bowl is too much money anyway. Will probably not return.

<Content> I stood and watched a man put on gloves on then rub his dirty hat with them. He then proceeded to use his hands to prepare my salad. Needless to say it was tossed it the garbage and I will never be returning. The staff needs training in preparing food in using safe and sanitary measures.

<Content> grabbed breakfast here this morning and enjoyed the spinache artichoke souffle and a coffee. do not try to order a latte or other espresso drink because you will be disappointed. just opt for their house blend or their columbian. i like this panera better than the one at old farm shoppes because the clientelle seems a bit more diverse. free wi-fi is a plus too. yummy soups and salads but don't try to order any of the panini sandwiches without meat...they'll tell you no. they are all premade and just waiting for the sandwich iron...kind of makes you glad you weren't allowed to order one.

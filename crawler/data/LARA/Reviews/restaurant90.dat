<Content> Restaurant reviewLunch combo time 6-7-8, quite inexpensive but I can't say that I was particularly enthralled by the food. I was shocked to see people take a few bites of their food and just leave it. It must have been that bad I guess. I ended up with the loaded baked potato soup that was somehow cold... Bacon Avocado Chicken Sandwich followed which I was shocked to see that it was half size for the lunch special. Very thinly cut avocado. All and all this was a below par meal. On top of that our server was not all too friendly trying to upsell drinks which we did not want. She came twice once to drop the food off and once again to bring us the bill. Pro: lunch combo for cheapCons: below average food, I had cold soup...Hidden gem: Dinner promo 2 for 20 dealSign up for email alert to deals and coupons, birthday free dessert

<Content> Don't touch the Ziosk !!!! You will be charged$1.99 for everything you do. Our waitress got it taken off but very disappointed we had to go through the process. Food was good, service was good, Ziosk was bad!

<Content> Had the 10ounce sirloin with cheesy mashed potatoes and loaded fries to replace the steamed broccoli at this location. Both of our steaks were way under done after asking for medium and medium well respectively, my fries tasted unseasoned, and the mashed potatoes were adequate but not great. I think I got a decent amount of food for the price but it could have been better. I like this location and figured they were having an off day. Our waitress did a great job being attentive and addressing our needs with the steaks. She gets 5 stars if I were rating her apart from the overall experience. I figure this is a fluke from an ordinarily good place to get fed at a reasonable price so I'm giving 1 star for past experiences, and 1 star for our waitress (although she'd get 5 if I were rating her apart from my experience.

<Content> I ordered the chips & salsa with a house margarita & the grilled shrimp tacos for dinner. Holy Toledo was it ever hot! My mouth was on fire!! I was so stuffed from drinking so much water I couldn't finish the tacos. They were really good too. The outside of my mouth even started to burn and I thought my throat was going to close shut. They were so good!!!I love Chilis but I think I might be allergic to the peppers they use because I thought I was going to die! But they were really good............:-)

<Content> My, how I loathe chain restaurants. But sometimes, you are stuck eating at them bc it's a group decision. I ordered the sweet & spicy chicken served with rice and steamed broccoli. This is one of their "lighter choices" coming in at 590 calories... there's a reason for that. It's a small meal portion-wise with a noticeably small chicken breast. I easily cleared the plate. The service here was spotty - took about 2 hrs for 3 of us to be served (no app or dessert). I guess if you're eating out, order something more fun. This leaves you unfulfilled.

<Content> Stranded in CU for Snowmageddon 2014. Chili's was the only place open. The team worked hard to serve hungry people in understaffed mode. Special cudos to Caren for working hard to please a busy bar area.

<Content> this is absolute balls!! its crazy that I love Chilis yet this specific restaraunt had THE WORST service ever...Not because we waited a long while, Not that the waitress wasn't a sweety, Not that the food & drinks weren't good BUT because my friend's water glass had brown stains on the inside after she'd already been drinking it, they also brought out the entree & appetizers came out at the same time OH and those plates were dirty as well. the worst part however was another friend dinning with us had lukewarm food with a side of hair YES I said hair in her food........NEVER AGAIN

<Content> It's Chili's you know what you are signing up for. I've never had a problem with service here and the food is always adequate, I enjoy the potato soup. Turn up.

<Content> The place was dirty when we came in on a Sunday evening at 6 pm. They weren't busy and had lazy enough staff to not recover. Our waitress had some sort of psychological problem where she talked to herself, wiped an over flowing beverage on her pant leg and allowed bland Luke warm food out of the kitchen. She didn't know how to service our one year old who was with us. Even another tabled complained about the food, the bathroom and the waitress.This location has really slacked off since the last few times I've pardoned this establishment in the last few years. I'm done visiting this location.  One star for effort. Another star for your past greatness.

<Content> A friend told me about this "hole in the wall" called the Chili's. Was wondering if it's a Mexican restaurant. Never heard of it before. Felt like it would be a really relevant eatery and so I went.Sort of cool how this place cultivates an ironic mainstream atmosphere. Feel like it would be a place where I would hang out with my high school friends if I lived in a suburb and not a "mid-sized farming community." Fun to hear mainstream music and eat really fancy, alternative food masquerading as regular burgers and fries [via McDonald's]. Sort of refreshing to have the hostess ironically saying, "Hey y'all, welcome to the Chili's" instead of some bro in a taco cart saying, "Hey bro, welcome to the Taco Cart."Ordered a burger. Felt like it was pretty good. And I also enjoyed the Bottomless Chips & Salsa. The salsa tasted like cilantro Sort of like salsa I may get at a "hole in the wall taqueria" that is actually a hole in the wall. Feel like the owners of the Chili's are brilliant since it's not very often we can eat fine food in an ironic setting.Was surprised that the ironic experience of eating at the Chili's even went down to the service. Always frustrated that when I eat at a relevant restaurant, it takes like 3 hours to cook some enchiladas. Felt like this was good that I could get quality food in like 20 minutes.Reading the other reviews of relevant Yelpers and feel like they aren't really appreciating the ironic qualities that the Chili's provides. Feel like they're pretty entry level but as long as they're enjoying the food, it must be enough.

<Content> I secretly love Chili's. There, I said it. I'm not proud. It's an obnoxious chain, but it's the obnoxious chain I default to when my friends want to go to a chain restaurant. And okay, the Southwestern Eggrolls are delicious. I've been to this location many times, and I've always gotten pretty good service. This is a reliable stop if you're out on Prospect and need something quick and relatively inexpensive.

<Content> I hardly ever go to chain restaurants but went to this dump for a friend. The seats had crumbs on them and table was sticky, I did ask to have it wiped off after we were sat.It took a little over 15 minutes to get a drink from the bar. I could see the girl supposed to be tending bar on her phone, but not making drinks. Manager's sitting at a small booth chatting and texting. Do people here want to make money? No problems with the food thankfully. It was on par with Denny's. Good place to buy a gift card for someone you dislike.

<Content> I've been to the Champaign Chilis twice now and both times the service was slow. Last night I ordered the tripple dipper and chose the Big Mouth Bites (hamburger sliders), the Southwestern Eggrolls and the Hot Spinach & Artichoke Dip. While the two mini-burgers and the dip & chips was good, it was nothing spectacular. (My Aunt makes MUCH better spinach dip!) The Southwestern Eggrolls were the entire reason I ordered this combo plate and I was seriously disappointed when my plate arrived to discover how incredibly overcooked these were; there were black edges where it looked like they had caught fire in the microwave and the flames put out! They were also dry like they had been partially cooked, frozen and reheated....Ick.If you like the "Friday's/Applebees/Cheddars/Bennigan's" standard American Fare, you won't be disappointed.

<Content> An older design, with a big traditional bar. Waitress is somewhat curt and pushes all the extras. Oh, they also serve food here - and it won't kill you - at least right away.

<Content> I can't believe I'm about to review Chili's, but we go here often enough that I may as well. Standard American fare, but I've found this place to have way better service than its peers in the area (Applebees, Ruby Tuesday) so we usually head here if we want something quick and American-y in North Prospect. Food is average, but they're pretty quick and the crowds of waiting people seem to dissipate pretty quickly at busy times.

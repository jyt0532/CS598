<Content> Restaurant reviewPhilly steak and gyros, you can't go wrong. This location is in the food court of the mall. As I try to eat my way through all of Champaign including all of the chain restaurants I ended up at this location. The staff was friendly and were quick to take our order. You can watch them cook up your meal in front of you. They have a variety of combo specials so check out the picture of that menu. I had the gyros which are cooked on the grill for you. No gyro spit unfortunately, but at least you know it is made to order instead of sitting in a vat of oil. The meal came with fries and a drink. Like any food court no self filling refill soda machine. Overall I would say the gyro was good, not as meaty as other places like Zorba's but still it was cooked well and not too greasy. Pro: combo meal dealsCons: no gyro spit, although they are the great steak company. My wife had the original steak again cooked to order. Hidden gem:Combo meal deal comes with drink, fries, and entree

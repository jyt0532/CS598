<Content> Nice place for a casual date! The penne al forno was good, but the garlic bread and spicy rigatoni with chicken were very excellent! The service was also consistently good. Recommend!

<Content> This place functions like a Chinese sit-down restaurants where all the items are meant to be shared. Almost all the menu items have a small (serves 2 people) and a large (serves 4 people). That's all and good, but it has an issue: it's a lie. My buddy and I ordered a small pizza... But we both agreed that we could have eaten that small pizza by ourselves and be satisfied. A small item and a side is sufficient food for two adults. Another issue is that it took an inordinate amount of time for a waiter to even service us.

<Content> I'd have to start out by saying that I didn't expect much. An Italian restaurant in a mall...not much to look forward too. However, my family and I were pleasantly surprised. We started out by meeting our waitress, who despite being very sweet, constantly sounded very aggressive whilst asking us for our orders. "Would you like a glass of water with that? I said, WOULD YOU LIKE A GLASS OF WATER?!" Not only were we one placement may short, we had to repeatedly ask for silverware. I proceeded to order a Shirley temple, my classic go-to when I'm trying to lose weight. But alas, the sweet concoction came without a cherry. I tried to move past that, but I have to admit the rest of my meal was quite scarred from the experience. Onto the food. One should we warned that if one would like one's own meal, this is not the place to go. Almost everything is served family style. The six of us decided to order the Caprese Salad, Spicy Chicken Rigatoni, Baked Ziti, and Eggplant Parmesan. the Caprese salad was the most cleanly cut mozzarella I have ever seen. Bravo. As for the pasta, I cannot complain, however the seasonings could have been a bit more present. One of the most dissapointing parts of the meal was when we were given the check with no dessert menu. I didn't order the Shirley temple for nothing, sweet pea. I cannot complain, but next time, I could've used a cherry.

<Content> If you're ok with food that tastes like it came from the frozen food aisle, then this is the place to go. Ordered the chicken parmigiana and it tasted like boxed breaded chicken you could get out of a grocery store with some extra on top to make it look nicer. High price tag for subpar quality.

<Content> This is the place to eat!!!!There is a vast majority of high end items, and everything is made from scratch. Everything is made from scratch. I feel this Buca is getting a bad rep, but there is new management, and really everything is delicious. There are many reasons to choose this Buca di Beppo. One of the best things I have experienced is the celebratory dinning, another great aspect is the family style eating experience, and finally the atmosphere is true and authentic. We went here with a large party, and we all split a numerous amount of dishes. We had plenty of left overs, and all left satisfied. The entire staff was extremely grateful and helpful. We loved our service. Having family style options is great because everyone communicates about each dish and the party really stays lively. This establishment really nailed it when it comes to aesthetics. The restaurant really looks like an authentic Italian restaurant. Also, what a top end liquor selection. They had every wine imaginable and a full bar. We really like Buca and hope everyone makes a visit in. IT'S WORTH IT. Go in to Buca in Champaign for a great experience.

<Content> This was my first time with the Champaign location. I usually eat at the Phoenix AZ one and I give them a 5! This one was good, menu has changed some. Service was great. Food was good. Our mozzarella appetizer could have been much warmer so the cheese was more "stringy" but entrees where good. They do serve family style but do single entrees as well. Prices are very reasonable. I would dine again.

<Content> Spaghetti and meatballs was just average at best although the meatball was good. However if you tell me I can't remove peppers from my pizza because the ingredients are all bagged.... That means your pizza ingredients are not fresh, they're cut somewhere else, they're frozen, and then they are shipped to you....i do not plan to eat here again. This is the first time I've ever had a waitress tell me they can't make a pizza the way I want... Which is freaking weird. This store is very dark it's very hard to read the menu or pick off peppers because the light is so dim. Now that I think about it the place kind of creeped me out.

<Content> The food was delicious. I didn't realize at first that it was "family style". The portions are very large, and the price is excellent when you consider how much food you're getting. It took over 10 mins for our waitress to come to our table after being seated. Other than that, we had an enjoyable experience.

<Content> I personally love family style dining. Sharing food at the table is a rarity for many families these days, and eating here with my family recreated that, even if just a little bit. Always helps when the food is good!We ordered a large portion of baked pasta, a small mixed green salad portion, and a large portion of mozzarella bread. Everything was very good and plenty for our family of 5. Our server was friendly and helpful, having to explain a few things since it was our first time eating there.My only complaint is the somewhat cramped dinning area that is cluttered with decoration.

<Content> The price range is deceptive because they serve family style. At first I thought the "small" was overpriced until I realized you could feed 3-4 people on one. For a franchise I find the quality decent. The service was great and they also regularly publish generous coupons...which entices us to add an appetizer or dessert. They make the money back.

<Content> My daughter wanted to go to Buca for her birthday dinner, so the whole family went along. My experience this time was much better than the first.I had a coupon for a free small appetizer. Our waitress told us that the amount could be used toward a large size appetizer, which was helpful.Service was very good. Our appetizer was the Cheesy Bread Florentine, which was very good. We followed with the Chopped Antipasto Salad, which was also very good. Our past dish was the Chicken and Sausage Zita, which was heavily spiced and a winner in our book. We had a few drinks which zoomed up the total bill.I was happy that the evening went so well. Although the food was much better this visit, I believe this chain is a tad too pricey for what you get. It would not rate nearly as high as a chain like The Old Spaghetti Factory for value.

<Content> We usually enjoy the food but hard to get into the price structure. They often have coupons to lessen the blow. First time we went packed lately was dead in there.

<Content> This place is in the mall in Champaign. Atmosphere 5 stars, cozy and romantic. Service 5 stars, could not have been better. Food 4 stars. I had the eggplant parma. which I would give 5 stars. Friend had the veggie pizza which she gave 4 stars. The bread was kind of boring and the dipping sauce not the best. I would go back for sure.

<Content> We love this Italian Restaurant. Decorated with great photos, friendly staff but suffers from a poor location near the Mall food court. My wife makes great Lasagna, but even she says Buca's version is the best she has ever had!! Some will not like the family style serving at dinner, but overall the product is outstanding.

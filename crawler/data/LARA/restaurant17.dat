<Content> The service is always amazing here...but last night, there were 15 people in line and only one person working the cash register! The staff is always friendly and go out of the way to make sure you have everything you need. My ONLY complaint is that there is not a turkey burger option. We love this place!

<Content> Decent burgers but for the price you can get better in town. The best reason to come here though is the cheese fries. Their cheese sauce is uhhh-mazing! The staff is always very friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming and clean. We eat here from time to time but since it ends up running about 30 bucks for two people we go here sparingly (or when we crave those cheese fries!!)I love that they give you sea salt grinders amd pepper grinders insteaf of the ol stuff we are all used to. Nice touch.

<Content> I come here when I'm craving a burger with my own pizazz. It's a little pricy, but they give you tons of fries and I enjoy the fancy soda machines. If they mess up something, they will acknowledge it and fix it immediately. They want you to leave a full and happy customer.

<Content> Went here one time after driving by it thousands of times. Just had the taste for a good burger. I was shocked in a good way. Very well put together restaurant, simple enough menu, excellent staff (the girl on the register was in training even), and the food was ready very quickly and they were busy. The food was excellent btw. Excellent burger and fries.

<Content> When I first arrived, the line was out the door which I thought was both a good sign about the food and a sign that this might take a while. But the cashiers were speedy and maybe the customers were decisive as well. The concept of this place is similar to that of Chipotle--you pick what toppings you want on your burger or you can choose one of their predefined burgers. I went with the second option and ordered the californian with regular fries and a drink which came to a total of just under $12. Kind of a lot for a meal at a fast-food like place but I was hungry so whatever. My meal was pretty good and there was a ton of fries in the "regular" portion. They were thin and crispy as well which I loved. The burger itself was good, it did fall apart a little bit when I tried to eat it, but there were a good amount of toppings so that was predictable. I was disappointed in the amount of cucumber wasabi on my burger as I was really looking forward to that. I feel like I only tasted it in one bite. Instead I just added some of the specialty spicy chipotle kethcup available which was delicious and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like ketchup and eats her fries dry. They also have Coca-Cola freestyle machines were you can pretty much have any Coke drink imaginable so that's cool. It also means the person in line behind me gets irritated because I like to check out all of my options before making a decision.

<Content> Man, this burger will haunt my dreams. We came across this place while we were in town for friend's wedding and we could not have been more impressed. I loved the warm, friendly staff and the fast arrival of our food. To top that, I loved the juicy burgers and chicken tenders (probably the best I've ever had - seriously!). It really hit the spot for dinner. My only wish is that you would expand out and create a location in California! Love this place and highly recommend!

<Content> I don't go for fancy dancy burgers, like wasabi or fried egg and weird flavors. But if you like that, they have it at Meatheads. There are tons of choices to put atop your burger.All fresh. It's an adult fast food atmosphere. I like the regular old cheese burger, so I got a 1/3 lb. burger, which is two thin  patties. All in all, it was tasty, it was almost everything I wanted in a hamburger. Fresh ingredients. The patties are fresh, never frozen, as per the manager. It was very tasty and our order came out fast, and the staff was friendly, the place is clean. The fries are really good. Crispy, thin (but not too thin) and salty!!!I'd go here again for a quick burger. UPDATE: I had a nice email from the manager, I would patronize this place again because it appears he CARES!!!

<Content> Our favorite burger place in Champaign. Great burger and fries. My favorite combination is Hawaiian burger with cajun fries. The fries portion is quite big, which could be enough for two. Beside the food, what makes us keep coming back to this place is its staffs - very friendly with smiles always on their face. Highly recommend when coming to Champaign!

<Content> I liked it. Despite some not so positive reviews, they have a really good burger joint here. Found the place to be immaculately clean. Even the mensroom was spotless. A lot cleaner than most of my recent Five Guys visits that had peanuts all over the floor, and garbage on top of the tables (China Town DC--you know who you are!).They kill you with too many fries, the burgers were good, very tasty and cooked to perfection, but my work colleague said his burger was too small. I felt my 1/2lb burger was appropriately sized. Service was friendly and fantastic and a manager-looking guy even bused our table.It's great to see a burger place like this offer a drive thru window.

<Content> We have been to Meatheads in both Champaign and Bloomington. Both times it was delicious! The burgers beat the heck out of Five Guys, and the fries do too! Especially the cajun fries! And you MUST try the cheese sauce for dipping...yummy and a little spicy. The milk shakes are for real, too. Great, now I'm hungry...

<Content> Just finished a wonderful salad called "the chopped wedge." Ordered it as listed on the menu board but added the crispy chicken. The iceberg lettuce was cold and crisp. I asked my husband when he had ever seen me eat a salad without dressing. Answer was "never." That' s how great this salad was. Have to add the blue cheese vinaigrette was very good ... I dipped my chicken in it! Great staff every time we go.

<Content> First of all I do not care for hamburgers but once in a while I will get one. I drove by Meatheads and noticed they had a drive through.& I decided to give it a try. Not a big menu. I had the kids meal which included french fries, cheeseburger and a teeny tiny drink.I am also not huge fan of french fries either (yes, I am American) but as far as french fries go these were excellent. The cheeseburger was OK too. I think it taste just like Culver's. You can get a cheaper burger at Culver's but their french fries are gross so if you are going for the whole meal thing this place would be your best bet. And they don't skimp on the FF, they give you plenty!!!The staff in the drive through were super nice.I tried to do a check in on Yelp here but it did not list it on my phone for some reason.

<Content> This place's burgers remind me of Five Guy's with more options. I'm impressed with many of their burgers, and my kids have enjoyed the chicken, too. I'd put their fries up against anyone's. The only restaurant that has better fries anywhere is Arthur Bryant's in Kansas City. I'm as pleased as I can be that they have a reading incentive program for kids. My kids are actually doing this and enjoying it. As others have mentioned, the freestyle drink machines are great. So what's not to like?!Did I mention my 5 year old likes to call them "Beefheads"? That's worth the trip by itself!

<Content> As an update re: my last review, I was contacted by regional management and was asked very nicely for specifics about why our experience was unsatisfactory. After voicing my complaints, I was offered a generous gift card ($25) for my feedback, which was not necessary but we appreciated it. We've already used it, and the service experience seemed better this time. While it's still a bit steep price-wise, I do like the burgers and it's comparable to several other fast-food places in town.Just want them to get the credit they deserve for following up so quickly to my relatively unknown Yelp posting to make things right.

The staff is incredibly friendly, the food arrives fast, and you can build your own delicious burger. So stop eating crap burgers from McDonald's/Burger King/Wendy's and other cheap fast food joints. Upgrade to Meatheads!

<Content> As far as drive-thrus go, this one is definitely on the nicer end, especially given it's location. There's really not much else around on that strip of Neil St. besides other chain restaurants.I had it for the first time the other day on my way out of town and got the Californian, a burger with avocado and this amazing wasabi cucumber sauce. It was pretty tasty. Definitely not lean by any means, but hey, it's a freaking burger.I will say that I did really like the little high school football scoreboard on the wall. I appreciate the interest in community. The servers were really nice too and the fries were pretty good. The soda machines were also brand new and had lots of options... and all it was a very clean, nice little place.However... I still have a couple suggestions:-Add truffle fries. We have them at every decent burger place up here in Chicago (I'm a Champaign native though fyi) and I think it just legitimizes the fact that you're paying for more for "just a burger". Plus they're freaking delicious.- Add turkey burgers, or bison, or venison or something. A turkey burger is easy, and delicious, and leaner and I know I'd get it.

<Content> The only fast food choice you should even consider in Champaign. Nearly leaps into sit-down restaurant status. Quality ingredients and a wide variety of choices make this a destination heads and shoulders above the rest. The staff is always friendly and very helpful. John was a welcome smile for my late night drive-through purchase. He encouraged me to come back to try the milkshakes. I definitely will include that stop on my next Champaign trip.

<Content> Awesome food and service. I get the Cajun Sunrise burger most of the time! Also, order kid sized fries because regular may be a little too much for most people. The serving is still a lot for "kid-sized"However, it seems they get new people staffed every so often which slows down the speed of my order because they are training. But everyone else working there is so nice and friendly!All in all, I really love this joint!! I frequent it and leave satisfied every time.

<Content> I stopped by Meatheads one weekend and while I had fun, I wasn't blown away. I ordered a cajun, which was a solid meal for one. The burger came with egg + fresh jalepenos (delish) + cheese, etc. hold the bleu cheese sauce. Everything was nicely spiced and season, but the egg was a little overcooked and the patties were on the dry side. For ~$7/person, my sister and I had a solid OK meal.

<Content> I love this place. It's a bit provide than the average fast food burger joint, but the food is so much better. I'd argue that the food is better tasting than most sit-down burger places in C-U. Perhaps more importantly to someone as dorky as I am is that they regularly cycle their Chef-inspired burgers off the menu, but they'll still make them; as a result, I've literally been ordering from the "secret menu" for months. Ask for the Goulden with Cajun fries--you won't be disappointed!

<Content> The atmosphere and service are great. Very modern and clean inside, and the staff was helpful and nice. The food, however, like others have stated leaves something to be desired. When I pictured a meathead burger in my mind I expected a huge beef patty, and instead get something similar to a McDonald thin patty. The meat didnt really have much flavor, and the sandwich pretty much fell apart. I will say the ingredients were very fresh, and they give you a ton of fries. Easily could split a order between two people. The coke machines are pretty cool and was more memorable than the food. I'll give this place another try sometime, but for the price, it won't be a regular go-to place.

<Content> Yuck. Normally I like to try a place a couple times before writing a review but I will not be getting anything else from this place.My girlfriend's coworkers got take-out from here and she got a burger and a sandwich for me. Her burger had avocado, lettuce, and tomato. My sandwich was an ALT - avocado lettuce tomato on white bread. So there was similarity.When we got it, the paper around both sandwiches was soaked through in grease and translucent. This is not, in fact, necessarily a negative. I didn't get food from a burger place to eat healthy. I love seeing the grease on the wrapping paper from Derald's on their breakfast sandwiches.My sandwich was disappointing. It had enough avocado - once I could find it in the almost half cup of mayonnaise on the sandwich. The lettuce was iceberg lettuce and uninteresting. The tomato was okay. The bread was just white bread, fried in some kind of cheap vegetable oil. That made the sandwich much "heavier" and unpleasantly greasy. Like I said, I don't mind some grease, but this stuff tasted cheap and stale. After eating it, I felt kinda sick later in the day. My girlfriend's burger had much less avocado. The patties were extremely thin and bland. The bun wasn't great either. For all they talk about fresh ingredients on the website, I am not seeing the quality reflected in the food.The prices aren't cheap, either - $5 and up even for veggie sandwiches and up to $10 for burgers. Fries are extra - so we didn't get any, but I hadn't heard good things about them. Compare this to Black Dog, where you get an awesome burger and fries or other side for $8. Or Derald's, where the burgers are much cheaper and the veggies look more freshly sliced. If you must eat at a chain, try Culver's, even that's a much better deal, I think.Since we got take-out I can't comment on the restaurant itself. I would still never get food from them again.Edit: a note on this review. After it had been up for a little while, I was contacted via Yelp message by someone from Meatheads. They apologized profusely for my dissatisfaction and offered me a complementary meal in the future. I haven't taken them up on it - I'm still not in a huge hurry to go back - but they are trying to address unhappy reviews, and I think that's worth noting.

<Content> My boyfriend and I were having a craving for burgers and decided to give Meatheads a try as opposed to going to our regular bar for burgers. We regretted it as soon as we took the first bite.The burger here was greatly unimpressive and meat itself was mostly tasteless. I like it when I have a rich beefy taste to the burger patty, but this one did not have a trace of it. (so much for advertising the beef ... ) The burger was dripping with grease and it soaked the bun with the grease which made it soggy. Needless to say, eating became a messy ordeal. For two burgers, drinks, and fries (regular and cajun) we spent nearly $22!!! I was thinking this was gonna be the best burgers I've had, but it was a huge let down.I'm not coming back for sure. Much too expensive, burgers AND fries were subpar. Even if it was cheap, I would pay more for something that actually tastes good. At least the people were nice. Decor was very modern and clean. Oh and they had the new coke machines. But those things wouldn't be any reason why I would come again.

<Content> I saw this place at 10am in the morning while I was on my way to Charleston, IL and made a small footnote to stop in on the way back. I pulled in around 2:45pm and the place had a good crowd in it. I have a fondness and a weakness for a good burger...must...stop...in!The place was clean, the staff was professional and patient while I ordered. I went with the 1/2 pound Meathead, Cheddar, Mayo, Ketchup, Mustard, Lettuce, Tomato and Applewood Smoked Bacon. Hey its not fancy but I like the combination. I ordered a large order of fries and was warned, I went with the small. I also ordered a vanilla shake, I'm out of town I miss my girls and needed to eat my pain.I forgot to order my burger medium, what I got was absolute perfection. The burger was like cotton candy, it melted in your mouth. The river of fries were at the height of crispy perfection and the 'nilla shake, wooh!Over 11 hours later, I haven't been able to eat another thing, just not hungry, that was a good burger, as good as it gets!

<Content> My wife and I went to Meatheads for the first time this evening. They did a great job remodeling the building. However...Our order was taken promptly, we were seated promptly although the tables were really close together and we felt like we were setting with six other people at our table. Even though the good folks setting on either side of us were pleasant and courteous, the seating did not make for a comfortable dining experience.I had a third pound meathead burger with all the fixings, a regular fry and drink. Our order was ready in supersonic record setting time and was brought to our table by a server. The burger was tasty and I really enjoyed the fresh cut fries. However...I understand turnover is important, especially on a busy Saturday night, and management wants to push as many people through the line as possible, but be reasonable. I have never felt so rushed or pushed to finish my meal as I was tonight at Meatheads. It was ridiculous! I barely got my last fry into my mouth before someone was hovering over me wanting to clear the table (and have me leave). Maybe it would be different say at 3:00 on a Tuesday afternoon. Maybe someday I'll find, or maybe not.

<Content> We've eaten here probably a dozen times in the last six months, and every single time the experience has been perfect.We typically order the "chef-inspired" burgers (Californian, Hawaiian, Reuben, etc.). We've tried them all, and they're all great. I've eaten burgers at a lot of places in CU and I'd say Meatheads ties with Crane Alley for my favorite burgers. (I even like them better than, e.g. Seven Saints, Destihl, and other high end places.) Crane Alley has fancier ingredients, but the quality is at the same high level at both places. I think that's very impressive for fast food.The other meals are good too. My daughter loves the chicken tenders, which are crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, unlike the dry chewy stuff you get at many fast food places. She also loves the hot dog, which is a real footlong.The fries are really, really good. And this is surprising considering they make them from fresh potatoes. Most places that I have been to that make fresh-cut fries (including, e.g. Five Guys) make a soggy, greasy mess that tastes like raw potatoes. Meatheads makes a hot, crispy pile of deliciousness that is really hard to beat. And with the cajun seasoning on them they are my favorite fries in town. FWIW they will also put things on them (bacon, cheese, etc.) if you want.The management at Meatheads is superb. Whenever we go at a busy meal time when the place is packed, the manager is always out on the floor watching *everything* and picking up the slack wherever it's necessary. This is exactly what a manager should be doing, but it is so rare in fast food that it is actually a pleasure to watch him and his employees do their jobs. It's like watching a well-oiled machine.Cooking is my hobby. I love fancy food. But this place is my guilty pleasure. I never thought I'd say this about a fast food restaurant, but to be honest it is my favorite American restaurant in town.

<Content> The burgers are definitely a cut above. They are comparable in price to the nice burgers in town at the Courier, Esquire, Crane Alley, etc. ($4-$7, depending on what you order). My husband still thinks that the Courier has the best burgers, but Meatheads blew the competition away for me. You get a larger portion of excellent tasting beef for the price. Every burger has at least two patties. Nearly everything about my regular meathead burger was perfect. The only room for improvement is the bun...but it wasn't bad at all--just not as gourmet as the rest of the burger. They have lots of fancy options. My husband really liked his Cajun Burger (although it was pretty messy to eat!) The fries are fresh, cut thin with skins on, and also served in large quantities. I have yet to try the shakes because Custard Cup is right down the street...The ambiance is casual and clean--a wide variety of songs played, not too loudly. There's plenty of seating and room to spread out, although I have seen it get pretty packed. This would be a great place to come with a big group because you could easily push tables together. They give you a number so that you can sit down after ordering and wait for a server to bring your food. The food comes very quickly. They also have the world's most high tech soda machine, with a touch screen menu of more than your average options. There's a drive through as well.Obviously eating here costs more than a fast food place would, but it tastes so much better. You're not eating pink slime, chemicals, fillers, or trans-fats, and it's obvious. It's still cheaper than eating out at a "sit-down restaurant." Tonight, my husband and I spent $16 for a filling meal for two and didn't have to tip anyone. When I'm in the mood for a burger at a casual place, this is where I will go.

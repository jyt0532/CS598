<Content> Fantastic smokey pig value.I followed the smell of smoked meat here; good start. Ordered the 8oz rib tips with a spicy pickle, hot BBQ sauce on the side. Flavor of meat was perfectly smokey with good bark, though drier than most (which I prefer to gum-able, fall off the bone). I found the sauce to be too sweet, tasted like apple pie, but wasn't unpleasant when combined with the rib tips; definitely get it on the side. Not very hot for being 'hot'.Pickle was very good. Fries were fine.Very good portion size and quality for a meal under $7. Atmosphere is what every bbq place should be.If I lived here, I'd get takeout and make my own mustard sauce.

<Content> This place has my favorite rib tips and side bread. The price is very reasonable and they serve a large amount of food for their price. I didn't give it a five because the restaurant is small and kind of dirty. So I do take puts for most of them times.

<Content> Porgies has been a staple of my life since birth. Tub o tips, extra spicy sauce, and the sweet taste of a jumbo lemon shake up can make the gloomiest of days shine bright. Perfect for an afternoon snack or a late-night feast, I recommend Porgys to any food loving soul.

<Content> yes yes yes yes yes, this place is legit due to the fact that you get huge portions for a very low price. Daily specials are all worth trying out, personally half chicken + fries + drink on sunday is my favorite.Another thing worth trying out is their 2 pound rib tips. so much food for 15 dollars. always get their sauce on the side, they give you way more sauce and you can use it to dip your fries and bread in too.i prefer mixed on the side

<Content> This place has the best BBQ hands down! You can actually get it delivered now. The Sunday special is their best deal with half a chicken, fries, two slices of white bread and an insanely HUGE cup of sweet iced tea or lemon shake-up for around 6 bucks. You get a choice of mild, mixed, hot or extra hot BBQ sauce. I'd recommend getting the sauce on the side and getting the mixed if you like spiciness, but still want to taste your food.Their rack of ribs is pretty good and they have turkey legs, if you're a fan. They cook everything right on the grill and you can get a whole lot of food for your money. Lil porgy's has turned into a Sunday afternoon tradition.

<Content> Lil'porgies is great, I frequent every other Wednesday with my mentee from the CU one to program. Porgies is fast, you order and your eating. Be sure to get your favorite sauce on the side, I like to eat my fries and pour as I go. Portions are right for a nice price with speedy service. Great for a quick eat.

<Content> My favorite BBQ place in town. I've made it a ritual of coming here every sunday for their half chicken ($6- half chicken, extra spicy BBQ sauce on the side, LG lemon shake up/coke, fries, and 2 pc bread) This meal will keep me very full and satisfied. I'm not sure if all the specials comes with a drink.. maybe you would have to ask the cashier because sometimes they don't put it in when you order. I really like their spicy pickle spear ($.10 each) When I'm not here on Sunday, I usually come for the rib tips. I'd get the regular order because the large order is really not that much more. I've never gotten the bucket of tips so I'm not sure how that comes out. tips:-order extra sauce ON THE SIDE (so it doesn't soak up ur bread and fries)-Half chicken or rib tipsThere's free parking and the service is extremely fast so your in and out very fast.

<Content> Ordered slab of ribs and ribs were over cooked. There was supposed to be bread with the ribs but could not find the bread until I looked under the American fries and then found the bread all soggy. Other people in party ordered pork sandwich. Thought it would be pulled pork but was not. That would not have been so bad though but meat was cold. No decor to speak of and not friendly people to deal with. Would not go to again.

<Content> This place is AWESOME. I am a university student from Chicago and have had my share of barbecue - Smoque from Chicago, Black Dog, etc. Out of all the barbecue places I have had, I can honestly say that Lil Porgy's is my favorite. My GO-TO is definitely the RIB TIPS (tub o tips can feed 2-3 guys) and the 1/2 chicken with mixed on the side. Some of my best college memories include the tub of tips. So good. Make sure to get the sauce on the side!!! This place is awesome and I will definitely crave it when I leave campus.Tips:-From personal experience, the springfield location seems to have better rib tips and the university location has better chicken.-There are daily specials (I love the Sunday special: 1/2 chicken, fries, and lemon shakeup for $5)-RIB TIPS + MIX ON THE SIDE.

<Content> The Sunday Special is a must - Half a Chicken. YUM. I love their extra hot sauce on the side. I once had it on top and nearly died of thirst if not for my Lemon Shake-Up. Sometimes, we take these to go and add extra Siracha to the mix. I think the chicken is usually quite moist, but I've been more 50/50 on the ribs. Sometimes they're dry, other times perfectly well done.

<Content> Pros: Huge drinks, huge portions, and getting your order before you even leave the window. It's also pretty darn cheap! Pretty good sauces, too.Cons: The ribs are a bit dry, and the sides are meh, or at least hovering around the meh vicinity. I think I ordered cole slaw and beans on the side, and they came in little shot-glass sized things. At that size, what's the point?I went there once and it was pretty good, but I'm not going back there regularly unless I have a huge case of the munchies.

<Content> This place has wicked good BBQ at super low prices. The sauce here is tart and vinegary. When they say spicy, it actually is a bit.They cook the meat over wood, for pete's sake. Imparts a great flavor.The only reason they are not 5 stars is the sides. Just aren't great. The bread is insipid; fries ok, but how hard is it to get fries wrong?Counter service is ok; not problematic, not dynamic customer service, either.It's not really a hang out an' chill place, very chow down and git atmosphere. Take out is the best option. Daily specials of lots o' meat for super cheap are the best reason to eat here.

<Content> Lil Porgy's is my favorite barbecue place in town. It's also my favorite barbecue place overall, and I've been to Memphis and St. Louis. I think some of the low-starred reviews here expected something different than what Lil Porgies is. Lil Porgies is solid, delicious food for cheap. If you want fancy sandwiches I recommend Black Dog instead - and the thirty+ minute wait. If you want something dryer or Texas style, try Hickory River. But if you want ribs, slathered in sauce, or barbecue chicken this is where you should be.I'm not a big fan of the sandwiches - they are kinda soggy - and I cannot begin to understand why you would order fried shrimp or fish sandwiches at a barbecue place. The smell of slow cooking wood tells you what you should order. That smell brightens my evenings as I drive home each night. The ribs are awesome. There is a range of quality - some days they are just Very Good, but other days they are Amazing. I think it has to do with how long they sit on the shelf over the smoke - the longer, the better. The barbecue chicken is also awesome - tender and very smoky. I prefer the mixed sauce, which is both sweet and spicy, but the mild is more sweet. They also sell the sauce along for cheap if, like me, you can't get enough of it.There are some seasonal offerings as well, like chili in a bread bowl or smoked turkey legs. The chili was good and a reasonable price but I always come back to the pork ribs. Meals come with big steak fries and white bread, both of which soak up the generous amounts of delicious sauce. There are daily specials, but the best days are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday - beef ribs, pork ribs, and chicken ribs respectively. The lemon shake-ups are sweet and delicious, too.I've eaten here many times and never been disappointed. One of my stand-bys. When I moved from Champaign to Urbana I was relived that I was still within a couple minutes' drive of a Lil Porgies. The building look a little sketchy but it's worth it to stop in.

<Content> Best BBQ in the world. I am still trying to find a place that can remind me of Lil Porgy's in Chicago...What makes it for me is the sauce, quantity and prices.That sauce. Tart, sweet, tangy, spicy...so good. It's like A1 sauce in consistency. For those of you that are iffy about the sauce (because it seems like people have mixed reviews on it, get it on the side. That's what I usually do so it doesn't make the bread and fries soggy). I get the sauce on the side as well as some extra. Slap that on those juicy rib tips and I am good.Yes, the lemon shake-up and Tea are amazing also. They have huge sizes for the drinks. I ordered a large and that looked like it was extra large!I love that the fries are actually more like wedges instead of limp soft fries here at some of the more acclaimed places in Chicago.They had great daily specials at around $5 for a meal, but I would recommend the rib tips if it's your first time. They do the ribs and chicken best in my opinion. I haven't even tried any of the other things on the menu (aside from the sweet corn)...and I don't need to.Whenever I drive to the C-U area, I have to pick up some porgies. I MISS IT SO MUCH!Update: Make sure to get the Large sized rib tips. It makes a difference. If you get the small size, they'll sometimes give you some of the tougher ends or pieces they want to get rid of.

The chicken was tender and delicious. I tried each of the sauces and they were all delicious. Our favorite was the mixed (not hot, not mild). We had NO leftovers.

<Content> The sauce is what keeps bringing me back. The delicious meats, while delicious, are an added bonus. The quality for the price kicks this up a notch to 5/5. This is written all over the place.I just have to say that the experience from my past 10 years in Champaign-Urbana have taught me to NOT GO TO CHAMPAIGN'S Porgy's.  This Porgy's in Urbana is consistent and generous especially when it comes to Rib Tips. My friends and I religiously order rib-tips about once a month. Champaign Porgy's often gives you around 40%+ BONE (not cartilage) in their Rib tips. This has been the case from the past 3 times I've been there this year. Not only that, the Turkey legs tasted off and soapy, like they've been sitting in a wet drawer in a fridge. They were inedible.The Urbana Porgy's doesn't cheat you like this. Urbana's Rib Tips consistently contain almost no bone (just juicy crunchy cartilage, which i enjoy), and their Turkey Legs were actually edible, if not delicious!I currently live close to Mattis (near Champaign Porgy's), but will always take the extra drive down to Urbana's Porgy's get my Porgy's fix. I've been scalded too many times to warrant purchasing from Champaign's Porgy's again.

<Content> Last night, while thinking about this place, I actually started to drool. I'm not kidding...then I vowed to write a review the next day.Go on sundays and get the half chicken special, comes with a HUGE drink and bread. Get the lemonade drink. Sometimes, I wish I could just buy their sauce (which I think you actually can) and just pour it on everything I eat. Their sauce is what makes their food delicious.

<Content> I'm always a fan of some good barbeque, and since moving to Champaign, I've been hearing tons of good things about this place. Fairly certain I also saw it had won some "Best Barbeque" awards for the area. My hopes were high, but after trying it, I was terribly let down.The barbeque this place serves reminds me of very average cafeteria style food. I'll say I definitely thought the meat was very good.. (I have tried the chicken, pork, and beef) and it has a nice smoked taste to it. Unfortunately, everything else that makes the sandwich fails. The barbeque sauce, perhaps ultimately the most important ingredient, pretty much is what ruins the sandwich in my opinion. Like a lot of other reviews have said, the sauce is unduly sweet, and extremely watery. It almost tastes like drinking liquid sugar in some regards... The bread is not much better. Sandwiches are literally served on tiny hoagie rolls like the generic ones you buy at the grocery store for $1. Probably the most generic, cheap type of bread anyone can afford... Sides were also generally unimpressive. Baked beans were nothing special, and I also had a potato salad side that seriously had almost NO taste to it. It tasted like eating raw potatoes.All and all, definitely a huge let down for me, and very sub par barbeque and sides. Really a surprise they keep winning the best Barbeque award for the CU area, but I guess there's no other competition? Sad to say, but this was probably one of the worst barbeques I've ever had.

<Content> This is a really fun looking place and it smelled great from the street. You order at the counter and they call your number. The place was really busy on a Sunday. I ate lunch there today and ordered a 1/2 slab, slaw and beans. I would like to give this place 2 1/2 stars but am erring low because the ribs were so tough, I couldn't eat most of them. I actually couldn't get them apart to eat them. The beans and slaw were a-ok but since I was there for the BBQ, I had to give them 2 stars. It's really too bad because the flavors were really good and the sauce is really solid. I will be back to try the chicken next time and may update the review at that time. I would try it if I were you but I would definately skip the ribs.

<Content> Among all the Southern-style BBQ places around campus, Li'l Porgy's is by far the most authentic, and flavorful. Frequent promotions made it hard *not* to go to Porgy's for at least some of our weekdays.Their southern sweet tea is wonderful.In comparison to the other Porgy's by the Original Pancake House; I've always thought this one to have a stronger smoky flavor.

<Content> I'm glad to write my first review ever about lil porgies!First I'd like to say that I've been eating here for over 4 years and for a place like Chambana, there's not that much to choose from. In my opinion, this place has one of the best smokie "cooked on wood" tastes in the area.I used to go a lot on Sundays for their 1/2 chicken special that included a 32oz lemonade shakeup, both which are delicious! All for under $5, this deal can't be beat. All their food has a good smoky flavor and you can order sauce in a few levels of spicyness, on the side or on your meat (usually mix is good). Most of the items on their menu are pretty good and fresh if you go during the lunch/dinner hours, although the beef ribs might be a little dry at times.All their entrees comes with an order of fries and are served on a tray with paper and foil, basic but gets the job done. The place is quite small and dirty, but the aroma of the smoked wood and the style of food makes it seem more authentic.The quality of food might not be the best, but if you account for their fast service, killer sunday special, good sauce and CHEAP food, this place is definitely for you. In my opinion best bbq "hole in the wall" as of now in Chambana.

<Content> I went in to Li'l Porgy's with very high hopes. It has been rated #1 BBQ in C-U for a number of years by several area publications... are these people on crack? I went the other day with a few friends of mine. I saw the shack and as we walked in, no frills, just a simple BBQ hole-in-the-wall. But see I saw this as promising, because good BBQ doesn't come from a fancy place. My staff was slightly hard to understand, but took my order. There's no table service, but I didn't expect that. I ordered a half-rack with a catfish sandwich and fries. I was very disappointed. That fish sandwich came out of someone's freezer. Literally it was a fried fish patty in a bun. TADA! My ribs were less than pleasing. The bones were everywhere; they gave me the crappiest slab of ribs. The sauce tastes like apples & cinnamon (honestly, just not my thing for BBQ). Fries come with every meal, you know like ten fries. Haha and they had the audacity to put my fries underneath my ribs to smother them in the awful sauce which in the long run made them soggy.Hole-in-the-wall or not...don't need to come back to this place.

<Content> Let me start by saying I grew up eating here and have always felt it was a four plus star casual BBQ restaurant. Something has happened in the last 12 months. The current quality is really a disappointment. Please bring back the old Porgy's. My last three pork sandwiches were soggy and gross. Today I tried the beef sandwich special and it was mainly sliced fat with overcooked dried beef. You still make a mean lemon shake up and the fries are always good.

<Content> Sorry to be so harsh on this place, but all the reviews got us really pumped for awesome BBQ. Nada...We ordered sandwiches to go with a side a piece. The sides are super small and overpriced for the same taste you could buy at Schnucks. The bread was soggy from the watery sauce and on a hoagie! What? Toast=cool, buns=okay, but a hoagie? Blek. The meat was tasty, but we could hardly get to it for all the sauce. If you want to try this place, order the sauce separate, because it made us nauseated for the rest of the afternoon.

<Content> Preface: I am a total BBQ snob--I know what I'm talking about when it comes to good smoked meat.If I was just evaluating the BBQ, I would give this place 5 stars. That being said, the mediocre sides/atmosphere take one star away from my rating. When I come here, I get whatever is on the daily special (a menu item with a 10% off price). Everything is great, as long as you come at the right time. As usual with any BBQ place, you really need to come during lunch/dinner rush hours to have perfectly smoked meat (another 2-3 hours waiting in the smoker will easily dry out the meat). The meat is served with 2 pieces of plain Butternut-looking bread, and steak fries. You can substitute the steak fries for another side if you wish ( I usually pick the baked beans, which seems like they are from a can).The sauce here is delicious! You can pick from Mild, Mixed, Hot, or Xhot Even if you are scared of a little spice, I would at least get Mixed--the mild is way to sweet for my taste. Watch out the the X-hot, it's very spicy stuff. I am a spice head and usually get the Hot. I can handle the X-hot but I reserve it for when I want to be sweating afterwards.Prices are great here! You would be hard pressed to find cheaper well-smoked 'cue anywhere else. I really don't get everyone's obsession with Black Dog--I feel that they oversmoke their food and overcharge for the small amount that you get there.Bottom line: Real hickory-smoked barbecue for a great price. Sides are mediocre, but sauce is great.

<Content> It was my first time here and was told to go, so I did. The food was yummy and when you ask for spicy BBQ sauce, it's spicy. Just the way I like it. The beef tips were worth the bite. The only thing that held me back from giving it five stars was the service. The guy who took our order was ok, but when we went to go pick up our order, we asked again for the number that was called. The guy didn't even answer us and just waved us to go on. Ok, so we took our order. We saw people get up and get refills so I went to go stand in line. The guy just kept on ignoring me as I stood there for a few minutes trying to be polite. He knew I was there standing there and after giving out a few orders, finally asked me what I wanted. So I told him and he was rude and told me "no!". Of course, I couldn't understand him so I asked him again for a refill and again, he abruptly said "No!" I told him that I saw others get a free refill and he just walked away, letting me hanging.Wow, so if you don't care about good service and only want good BBQ, this is the place to be. Don't expect a smile. They treat you like you're imposing; nevertheless, enjoy the food.

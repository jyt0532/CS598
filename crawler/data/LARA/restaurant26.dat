<Content> Looking at the other reviews, I am mildly ashamed of my rating choice, but most of this review/rating speaks on behalf of the tofu dishes. I love tofu that is somewhat dry and crispy. I would not have known such possibilities in tofu texture existed if it weren't for Chopstix (kidding, It could have been anywhere, but as far as I can recall it just so happened to be Chopstix). Unfortunately, I don't remember the first day I tried the tofu here, but before that I would have easily given Chopstix 2 or 3 stars, because their meat game is whack. After eating their tofu, I think that what they have lost in meat cred has been regained in tofu merit. I usually order the General Tso tofu combo with spring rolls (I think the spring rolls are good too) and have also tried the Szechaun, Orange, Sesame, and Kung Pao tofu. I prefer the General Tso, Sesame and Orange tofu because they often tend to contain the dryer, crispier tofu texture I adore. The meat dishes I've tried aren't that great (i've tried the sweet and sour, sesame, general tso, orange and kung pao chicken); compared to other restaurants in the area, it ceases to impress.Another thing it has going for itself is the fact that it stays open later than most; this gives the standard weekend drunkard no choice but to darken it's doorsteps (which honestly isn't that hard after a couple of drinks and if you like the dry, crispy tofu texture as I do).

<Content> Maybe I'm not being fair because I usually don't like Chinese food as a whole, but my take-out experience was sub-par at best. I came in late at around midnight and got Mongolian beef with egg-fried rice and an eggroll.It was definitely not worth $10 in terms of taste or portion size, I was really expecting better. There was also probably more onions then beef which was also annoying.I would say the only thing this place has going for it is the late night delivery and variety of options. Maybe I goofed and didn't order off the "Our Most Popular Items" list.I'm not sure, I'll be very reluctant to try it again, sorry!

<Content> If you are looking for good Chinese food, then look elsewhere. However, if it's 3 in the morning in CU and you need your fix of Sesame Chicken, Lo-Mein, or Crab Rangoons then this place has your answer! Some of the other dishes load up on vegetables and give you very little protein considering the prices they charge, so make sure to check before ordering! Mediocre Chinese takeout for above average prices.

<Content> Please do not support this establishment. They are extremely rude. I ordered a large egg fried rice (delivery), recieved in an hour when they said 40mins, & when I got my food I couldn't eat it because it was very hard. My cousin ordered combo meals & they're food was gross & hard too. I called to make a complaint & a male & female worker went off on me. I've eaten here before so I know how the rice is supposed to be. They both told my cousin & I to never eat there again. I asked to speak with a manager & asked for my money back & she hung up on me. I've called 6 times & they both hung up on me.The lady also told me if I kept complaining she would call the cops on me. Wtf calls the cops on customers who don't like their food? They're a bunch of idiots.**** Do not eat here!!!!****

<Content> This is mediocre chinese takeout, which is really saying something. It's also incredibly expensive. My total for some shrimp lo mein and crab rangoon was ~$17 (with a tip, because you shouldn't take it out on the peons), and the food was really not very good.I'm sort of amazed there aren't better options in town.

<Content> Their shrimp lo-mein is the only "alright" dish. I tried the shrimp with broccoli once and it was garbage. A guy told me this was the best place ever. We aren't friends anymore.2 stars because both Lai Lai Wok and Cravings are better than this place in my opinion. And they are right the corner from chopstix.

<Content> Today, we ordered takeout from chopstix as we frequently have in the past, but this experience was so bad that I doubt we will return, and I encourage you to BE CAREFUL if you order from this restaurant. As we began eating, my friend took a bit of general tso's chicken with a STAPLE in it. After spitting out the staple and experiencing quite a bit of confusion we called chopstix to complain. They immediately denied that this was possible and told us that it must have been one of our staples (which had miraculously inserted itself into a piece of chicken in a sealed plastic container on the drive home). They demanded that we send a picture of the staple to their cellular phone number. We did so immediately, within seconds of the requrest. The owner got onto the phone and claimed that the staple could not possibly be one of theirs because it was "curved" differently. My friend attempted to explain that this was impossible, but was screamed at by the owner and his wife. The owner then told her that she would get "IN TROUBLE" if she reported this. We are taking our chances and calling our local chapter of the Illinois Department of Public Health tomorrow morning.

<Content> When this place first opened up, I was confused because there are already like half a dozen Chinese restaurants on or around the U of I campus. So I wondered how they would be able to compete.Here's how. They deliver and they deliver late. If you want food at like 1 am, they'll bring it to you. I don't think any of the other ones do. And this place has cheap prices for pretty decent food. It's not like authentic authentic but it gets the job done. And it's still more Chinese than panda express. I always get the crab ragoons. I like how it's not traditional and they roll them differently. And the beef and broccoli is always a good choice. pay cash and they give you like a 30 cent discount too!

<Content> So far I have only invested in Chopstix's delivery service. As a vegan, I am content with the variety of tofu dishes offered, as well as the choice to either order a large entree or to go with a combo meal. Sometimes the deliverer of my goods has called me to inform me that the car is outside my dorm--this is after me not able to hear anything on the other side of the line--and the car is not, in fact, waiting there.I would personally advise against ordering the spicier dishes because my experience with those orders is over-filled with red pepper flakes instead of a variety of specs that add kick. Maybe I just don't order spicy Chinese food often enough to know better. Nevertheless, I have been very satisfied with my sesame tofu, regardless of the fact that it doesn't come with veggies in the combo platter, and I always have received more than one fortune cookie.

<Content> so the good thing about chopstix is they deliver pretty much to anywhere till 3:00 in the morning (but they wont open till 4:00 afternoon so~ ) i wont call this place a cheap eat because their price is kinda high (above 10 bucks per entree) but the portion is big. However, the food tends to be on the bland side, and seem all have the same vegetables cooked in it (carrots, bamboo, water chestnuts, bell pepper --- all these cheap stuff) also, THE RICE BECOME ROCK HARD when it gets cold?!!!!!!1!!! those little bitches almost crack my teeth! (well, i ate too much sweets so my teeth are kinda in a bad condition and soft lol) anyway, their diced chicken is also very chewy and hard, (sliced one maybe better), oh oh and the texture of beef/pork is also not so good, its not tender nor juicy, just all kinda hard. Okay, on the plus side, they do made good craB rangoon (tho there is no actual CRAB in it, just cream cheese) but they are really big and fried till crispy. their curry flavored dishes are also worth a try. all in all, a okay place for college students to get late night Americanized Chinese food.

<Content> Chopstix.. definitely a drunk food classic, but soberly I would pass. The food is overpriced for the portions, takes a long time to get delivered, and tastes very sub-par. However, the crab rangoon are the best in Champaign. They're huge, meaty, and absolutely delicious - essentially the only reason why I would order from there anymore.

<Content> I'm seriously disappointed at the modest number of local places that will service the midnight appetites of college students. And given the intense competition among Chinese restaurants in Champaign, I think it was a smart business tactic for Chopstix to exploit the late night market. Chopstix delivers food until around 3:00 a.m. each night; the trade-off is that they don't open until 4:00 p.m.The actual storefront is just a counter with 3 tables (not really an invitation to stay and eat), but the service is friendly and enthusiastic.As for the menu, you'll find all those greasy Americanized-Chinese standards: lo mein, fried rice, and combo platters (entree, rice, and egg roll). You'll need a gallon of water to offset the astronomical salt content of the food, but nobody eats at a place like this without expecting to do so.I ordered shrimp egg foo young, and the quality was above average. The egg patties were an equal mix of meat and sliced vegetables (onions and nappa), with the edges crisp from frying. I liked that the vegetables still had some substance and texture, and that the sauce wasn't a heavy, sluggish gravy. Some bright green onions were even sprinkled on top to offer color to a usually drab plate of food.Overall, a welcome addition to the late night eateries in Champaign, especially as the food is really pretty decent.

<Content> The minute I walked in to Chopstix I knew it was different from the other 50,000 asian food restaurants on campus. I have never in my life been treated with such customer service, and the owners never acted as though they were "pretending" to be nice in order to gain popularity.Every time I go in, I am treated like family, and Chopstix ALWAYS satisfies my chinese food cravings!!! Prices are extraordinarily cheap-- you can easily get two meals out of one order (their portions are huge!!) and not pay more than $8.I can't say enough great things about this restaurant- the owners really know what they are doing!!!

<Content> I was expecting to see a bunch of two-star reviews, so now I feel badly, but... I was hella thrilled for midnight Chinese with my sister after we got off work. I was hella not thrilled that the wonton soup was straight up the most ridiculous soup ever. The wontons were MASSIVE... which should be GOOD... except that they were nearly impossible to eat based on their size (not a big deal) and almost tasteless. I mean, these wontons are massive, but had the same amount of meat as a wee-wonton. The broth was nearly tasteless.We also shared the Szechuan pork which came in a huge portion, but really tasted like veggies and a little pork with teriyaki sauce. Still, not expensive, huge portions, open late.

<Content> Coming from the northeast I've definitely lowered my standard for Chinese food, so I'll admit this isn't the best food around. What I will say is that their service is amazing and since they are the only late night Chinese restaurant around (especially with delivery) when it's necessary they are tops!I've come to realize, it's acutally pretty decent food. You can't go wrong with General Tso's or Orange Chicken. My friend likes their fried dumplings and their Wonton Soup is good. What you'll notice is every time you come in, regardless of it's your first or second time, they'll always greet you with a smile and take care of you. There's a sweet girl who works in there, who I swear must be on pills because she is always happy and super nice to you. It's mainly a take-out and delivery place, but you can eat there. When you eat there, they'll serve you water and bring you napkins and such, but it's not really an eat-in place. There's a 3% discount if you pay cash.Being on a college campus, we all get interesting cravings for interesting things throughout the night. Chopstix is currently the only restaurant I know of that does both take-out and delivery until at least 3:00am. By the way, delivery is relatively quick. Just try it out, it's pretty good.

<Content> I spent 10 bucks (plus delivery and tip) for the Kung pao beef. I got maybe $2 worth of beef at most. It was literally 80 percent vegetables. Like are you kidding me? Did they not have beef left or what? The biggest waste of money When It comes to food in cu. Beef was OK. The vegetables (that made 80 percent of the meal) were honestly crap and distasteful. Please go online and order from Any of the other countless Chinese delivery places. They are ALL better.

<Content> I am a fan of Chopstix delivery service! Chopstix is a new Chinese restaurant on Green and 2nd. My roommate has been ordering food there a couple of times and encouraged me to try it. The menu is like any other chinese restaurant: soup, appetizer, poultry, fried rice, etc. The girl who picked up the phone was very nice. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken entree which included a side of whtie rice and was priced $9.05. A lot of the entrees are p riced between $8-9 which isn't too bad. It's on the border of pricey, however, I don't mind paying this much from Chopstix. They have a combo platter which I wouldn't recommend ordering. The combo platter is priced between $7-$7.50 and is a smaller portion than the entree. It is served with steamed white rice or fried rice with a choice of either egg roll or spring roll. The portion is too small and they don't give you enough meat in the combo platter. In addition, the egg roll isn't that great. However, my General Tso Chicken entree came in a timely manner. It was hot and fresh. The delivery guy was very polite and I gave him a $2 tip. On the side note, I just found out that they will charge a $1.50 delivery fee if your order is $15.00... oh well. I'm excited that they're open till 3AM which I need to take advantage of in the future. Anyways, I would recommend ordering at Chopstix again. Thank you, roomie for this awesome recommendation.

<Content> Full disclosure ahead of time: I worked here as a cashier for a few months (October 2012 to February 2013). As one of the only establishments open after 2 AM on campus, it caters to the last call crowd; having been on both sides of the table, literally, this in itself is quite the experience.As for the food, I would go to Cravings for more complicated dishes, but for staples like spicy chicken fried rice, orange/sesame/General Tso's chicken, Chopstix can't be beat.

<Content> I ordered Kung pao chicken, it came with pieces of chicken chucked in celery and peppers. The chicken pieces were hard, almost raw, the dish was barely edible. I called them and let them know, he said he personally packed it and it was 'double cooked', and "If I don't find the taste to my liking, sorry about that" I requested a coupon for next time, nope! We don't do that! Yes thank you very much chopstix, just coz you are one of the few who deliver late at night (this was afternoon btw) you think you'll not care about your customers. Drag yourself to Cravings or Panda express (which is way off campus but amazing). Do not bother with this restaurant.

<Content> This place is anything but authentic, but it is the most addicting place to order food if you love Chinese American and you're a broke student. I seriously order when I'm 8 drinks in or stone cold sober. My friends have to claw my Blackberry out of my hands when I'm walking home from my weekend drunken escapade just to re-delete this saved contact. Too bad I know it by heart ;-) The only bad thing I can say about this place is that it opens at 4pm when I really would love to order it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If I could tell the management anything I'd say to please hire day people and just stay open 24-hours... it would seriously pay off if there are more crazy people like me. Overall, order here and you'll get yourself a perfect batch of fried rice (that may not actually be fried but it's totally delicious) and some General Tso's Chicken without the breading... YUM!

<Content> I was seeking a decent Chinese take out/delivery restaurant in town, so I saw that Chopstix was highly rated on Yelp. However, what is not reflected in the high ratings is what the normal clientele are for the restaurant. I am sure that Chopstix is great for college students who are seeking something late night to soak up all of the booze on a Friday night. All I am looking for is decent Chinese take out. And I found this food barely edible. The General Tso's chicken was so dry as to be difficult to chew. The good news is that the portions are very large. So you get very large quantities of nearly inedible food.I definitely will not be back!

<Content> My go to when I want late night Chinese. I usually get the lo mein or sesame chicken (or tofu) platter. For about $8-9 you get a decent portion of entree, fried or steamed rice, and a spring or egg roll. Their crab rangoons are folded more like a pocket, but are still good (little oniony, though). Delivery is fast and service is very good. Not the BEST Chinese food in town, but still good, especially when everything else is closed.

<Content> It took 40 minutes for the food to get here, and when it did, they forgot my spring roll. Because of my hunger, I was willing to let that pass. Sadly, the food wasn't much better. In layman terms, the food was crappy. The fried rice tasted like rice mixed with some salt and a lot of pepper. The beef and broccoli tasted like fake beef and nasty broccoli covered in soy sauce. I am very disappointed. Never again. I'm sure there are many better alternatives to late night Chinese food.

<Content> I've gotten takeout from this place twice now (szechuan chicken dinner combo and I must say I have been impressed. Not your typical greasy joint (although it has the same menu as one), the food was cooked to order with good quality chicken and veggies that still had a decent bit of crunch. You can sub the egg roll for wonton soup for 85 cents, so I did. It was yummy and definitely hit the spot The only downside is that the dinner combos are just under 8 bucks, which is a bit high... but considering the quality I think this will move up in the 'it's late and I don't have any food at home' rotation.

Chopstix is perfect for dinner or late night if you do not feel like going out or low on budget. At least all the food that I've ordered has been good.

When I am at work, late nights, they deliver and when you call there is always someone nice and helpful to help you. Their prices are reasonable and the delivery people are very personable. I generally order the Chicken Broccoli combination which comes with steamed or fried rice and an egg roll. Their egg rolls are chicken and always nice and crispy. I am a big fan of this place and have recomended it to my coworkers!

<Content> I was very excited when I saw that a new Chinese place was open and that it is open really late! Then once I saw their menu and saw that they have a tofu general tso's I had to try it. So I did and it wasn't all that great. I am not sure how other general tso's are, but this one didn't have any broccoli at the bottom like other ones that I've had and the tofu was ehhh. Some pieces had a really good crisp to them, and others were tough and chewy. The food is reasonably priced and you get a ton, but stay away from the tofu general tso's unless you really really like tough and chewy tofu and rice. I know I will next time.Oh, but one thing they do get points for is if you pay with cash you get a 3% discount, even on delivery.

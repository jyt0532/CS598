<Content> I've never eaten at the Green Street location. I can say that the location at The Crossing (Windsor and Duncan) is the best pizza in town. Here's why:1. The sausage is stellar. I don't even get sausage pizza all the time. I get it nearly every time I order from Papa Del's it's so good.2. The crust. I always get the thin crust. It's not cracker thin. It is still crispy though and has never been soggy.3. The sauce. It's not the best I've ever had but It's the best in town. I always get extra sauce and the amount is just right.That's it. It's easily the best in town and my first choice when ordering or picking up pizza.

<Content> It's nice to know that there is a good deep dish place this far away from Chicago. To be honest with you, I prefer thinner pizza, but my roommates insisted on trying Papa Del's one boring Sunday evening. We ordered a cheese and sausage which was delivered in about an hour.The dough is the correct consistency and there was not too much nor too little of it, which is usually an issue at many not-as-well-known deep-dish pizzerias. The cheese tasted great, and there was not 16 tons of it piled on, which can sometimes ruin the pie. Also of good quantity (and quality) was the sauce. It was flavorful and the pizza was not swimming in it, which is all too frequent a problem in the world of crappy deep-dish.The sausage itself was pretty tasty. I'm not sure if it was fresh or not, we probably should have asked. Back home, fresh toppings are deciding factors for my family, since we can be pizza Nazis. Either way, I just wish there was more of it on the pizza. There was probably only 1-2 little balls per slice, which in my opinion could have been more plentiful.I will definitely order Papa Del's again and recommend it to anyone who enjoys deep dish.

<Content> Dining-in: it's crowded, loud, and the service is awful. I get that the pizzas take a while, but that doesn't mean that everything else should, too. I've never had a polite interaction with the staff here (nothing outrageous, but for a Champaign "staple", one might think that the staff would be a little more gung-ho about being such an attraction to visitors... yes, you, I saw your roll your eyes at me when I changed my order mid sentence. Rude!).Ordering-in: A good experience because I can avoid the cramped seating and the impolite staff. Deep dish holds well as a reheat option the next day. Their sausage pizza is really delicious.One plus: I have friends in Chicagoland who love this pizza and if we're in Champaign for a visit, we bring back Papa Dels. It travels well.Overall: If you're in Champaign, yes, it's the best deep dish there is. If you're from anywhere else, you can do better.

<Content> I grew up here and have been coming to Papa Dels since 1976. It sure has gotten mediocre.Went here today for lunch and first off the restaurant needs an update (this building dates from the 1990s if memory serves when the original location on 6th St. closed). It's ratty looking with a huge stain on the ceiling where the wallpaper has peeled off. Fix it. How hard can that be?The dough for the pizza (we ordered slices) has always been on the bready side, but I used to like that since it was moist and flavorful. This was dry as dust, lacking in sauce and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp forever. Blech.And seriously. It's not 1976 anymore. A salad can contain something other than iceberg lettuce. It's even available here in the midwest now, if the local grocery stores are any indication. Use it.My nephew ordered breadsticks that were just gross. Huge batons of bread (the pizza dough?) with a nuclear cheese or marinara sauce. They were completely unflavored. No cheese, garlic, butter or anything. Just batons of dry bread. Again, gross.Sad that an old institution has gone so far downhill.

<Content> This is the best deep dish pizza in Champaign! Service is fair, but the food makes up for it! It is usually crowded during prime dinner times and big weekends in Champaign, so make sure to plan ahead and call your pizzas in ahead of time. Their delivery is not very reliable, so I suggest carrying out if you are not up for dining in.

<Content> Papa Dells pizza pales in comparison to real deep dish pizza. The crust is very thick and not flavorful. The sausage and pepperoni toppings aren't anything special. I do enjoy the amount of cheese they put on their pizza. If you want the Chicago pizza experience don't waste your time here or money.

<Content> I'll NEVER go to either of the Papa Del establishments again. After paying $50 for two pizzas that I waited almost 1.5hrs to have delivered, I received subpar products (overcooked and poorly made). To make things worse, when I called to give feedback and ask for some kind of accommodation, I was talked down to by one shift manager Rob and hung up on by another Mark. After 20 yrs. of patronage, I expected better. They have lost my business forever and I'll be sure to let the owner Bob know exactly why!

<Content> The pizza was great, just make sure you get it and run. The seating at the Windsor Rd. site consists of patio tables and plastic patio chairs haphazardly arranged in a small waiting area. Not an ideal way to enjoy great pizza. The paper plates and plastic cutlery they provided, however, was a classy touch.

<Content> In the fast food world of college campus towns, every place should have a traditional place that stands the test of time. That's Papa Del's. Quality pizza & sandwiches with great flavor, huge portions & reasonable prices keep you coming back. Service is slow and the building's architect should have been fired @ the first drawings review, but it's all about the food here & it is good.

<Content> Bad pizza, average service, not a place that I would visit again.I order the so-called "Stuffed Pizza". In Chicago, stuffed pizza usually has a lot of cheese with only a little bit of crust. This pizza was totally the opposite, with hardly any cheese and a crust as thick as a loaf of bread. The crust also had a bread texture with no flavor whatsoever. I noticed a number of tables around leaving nearly half of their crust before they moved onto the next slice. When you have to leave that much crust behind, something is wrong Also, there was hardly any sauce on the pizza, and the sauce was burnt as well. Another thing they did was add A LOT of oregano on top. If it was a good pizza, it should be able to stand alone without any help. The addition of this oregano makes me wonder if the restaurant isn't confident in their pizza. While I kindly asked for the rest of my pizza to be put in a to-go bad, I threw it away in a garbage can near my car, as I knew I would never finish it at home.I also ordered garlic bread with cheese. The bread was hardly toasted, and the cheese peeled right off. Again, very disappointing.I was thinking that this would be a good alternative to Chicago-style stuffed pizza. But what I had tonight was anything but Chicago-style. Basically a loaf of bread with mediocre sausage and burnt sauce.

<Content> I am not going to lie. I was so nervous trying this place for myriad reasons.I am from the Western Suburbs. I love Stuffed Pizza. First, let me remind you there is a difference between stuffed, deep dish, pan, double dough, thin, and extra thin. Examples: Papa Del's=Stuffed (stuffed crust, cheese, EXTRA THIN LAYER OF DOUGH, Sauce). Nancy's, Giordano's, and my local favorite growing up, Gianorio's of Winfield excel in making this type of pizza. Deep Dish=Lou Malnati's/Gino's East (crust, cheese, sauce)Pan= Connie's (THICKer.....crust, sauce, cheese) I want to say Papa Del's Sicilian is very similar to this, but it is their specialty that I have not tried as of yet, but I will soon!Double Dough= Self explanatory. Usually closed to hand tossed.Thin= Average local joints mix between this double dough. Think Home Run Inn, Domino's standard, Papa John's. Pub crust is often used here as well.Cracker thin=specialty, like Vito and Nick's Anyway, now that we have that all settled, Papa Del's still gave me pause before ordering...especially when I ordered, the clerk didn't seem too happy to know that I had 20 coupons (10 dolla off any L/XL pizza). One of my best friends' sisters actually had a run in at this location with a waitress which is the reason why I had waited so long to try this place! Again, why let some snobby undergrad waitress ruin the nostalagia that is crust, cheese, sauce, and love?Decided on the Super Stuffed Cheese. 21.64 our total, which was before the coupon. We'd have to wait an hour and since I live 25 minutes from here, it worked out well.The stuffed pizza was AMAZING! The clerk was actually very nice, the total ended up being under $11 with the coupons, and I had a "pizza warmer" in my car for the long drive! SCORE! I thought the crust would be dry, but it was full of flavor! The cheese is the highlight of this pizza for sure! The seasoning in the sauce really wasn't there, but what do you expect in a college town pizza joint? Well, have high expectations for this place!Some of the best pizza I have ever had! I would put it in my top 10 pizza experiences of my life! Even though the drive through the rain sucked on I 57, I know I will be back!I was so worried it would not be up to my high standard, but I can't wait to have it again...plus even try the Sicilian! GO TO PAPA DEL'S IF YOU ARE in Champaign!

<Content> On a recent visit to Champaign, my bro and I decided to get some Papa Del's to bring back to his place in Paxton for dinner... and boy were we in for a treat!Being from Chicago, REAL pizza is either Deep Dish or Stuffed. Don't give me that thin garbage (thin is good, but its not za). I want to eat my pizza with a fork and knife, and Papa Del's Super Stuffed fit the bill!Note: Please don't get me started on people who don't know the difference between Deep Dish/Pan vs. Stuffed. If you have a question, just ask, because I will thoroughly explain it to you.Our order took about an hour, which is fine, because you can't rush perfection. Our total was very cheap too, because my bro acquired 20 coupons for a special deal.I'll be honest, I was a bit skeptical because this is Champaign.... a very far cry from Chicago. Once you are south of 80... be very wary of Pizza! now to the good stuff: the super Stuffed. It was fantastic! The crust looked sort of dry on the initial viewing, but on tastinhg, it was awesome. It has a nice chew, but was not chewy or crunchy. As for the cheese, the pizza had plenty, which was awesome as well. The sauce was very good too; it wasn't amazing, but it was seasoned nicely and did not just get dumped from a can (unless I'm totally !off, which I doubt). I actually wish there was more sauce, but oh well.I was pleasantly surprised at how good papa Del's was. IT made me feel like I was still eating Za from Chicago, which is a very good thing.Will I be back? You can count on it. The onlydecision I have to make: Their Deep Dish, or the SuperStuffed with Spinach (Only got cheese on this previous trip)? either way, I'm looking forward to it

<Content> Delicious pizza but awful service. The pizza is delicious and it never disappoints. Tons of cheese and a lot of crust, so this is not definitely for people counting calories. Every time I go to the restaurant the wait is very long, sometimes even over an hour. The staff doesn't seem very attentive either, and they charge $1 for a take-out box. My advice: either get delivery/take-out or go somewhere else.

<Content> I went there before an Illini b-ball game. It's crazy busy on game day, so get there early and put your pizza order in while you wait for a table if you want to save some time. The thick crust takes about 40 minutes to bake and if there's a line already, expect your order to take about an hour and quarter. So, it's nice to place the order ahead of time, grab some drinks at the bar, and then get seated with about 20 minutes left to wait for your pizza. Staff is super friendly.Now for the food... the other reviews don't lie. It's delicious. I like Chicago deep dish and this is some of the best I've ever had. The dough is fantastic and the cheese is melted perfectly. They have a great selection of toppings to build your own pie and it's not too pricy.

<Content> Alright. I'm a Chicago boy. I have a deep dish pizza beating in the center of my chest. Don't get me going about what is mistaken for pizza in other parts of the country.That said...this place is great.My daughter introduced us to this place after a late night trip down to Urbana. Wow. It was better than expected.Food: Excellent pizza. We had deep dish and it was high quality, flavorful and abundant. Cost was very reasonable.Service: It was just before closing time and the young fellow taking care of us was attentive, personable and overall just great.Atmosphere: This place screams college town pizza joint. That should be all you need to know. It reminds me of an old pizza joint that was located on Taylor street in Chicago's little Italy. The place is closed now and there is a high end restaurant (Tuscany) running there now. It was dark, lots of wood and smelled of beer.Overall: It's a winner. Bring the family or order out. Great Pizza.

<Content> Although I am hopeful every time I see a Chicago pizza place, I am usually skeptical. This place looked perfect for what we were looking for... natural light, TV's, laid back, etc. We ordered breadsticks not knowing they are like 2 ft long! They were good but we couldn't make much of a dent.The stuffed pizza was a small but it was almost as tall as it was wide. It looked good and we struggled to figure out a way to conquer it. Unfortunately, the dough didn't do it. It was the same dough that was used for the breadsticks but it felt like I was eating pizza on a giant piece of Wonder Bread! My crust needs a little more personality and pizzazz and without a solid crust, the pizza isn't worth much!

<Content> When I fall in love, I fall hard. Imagine, a scared college freshman away from home for the first time. Ready for new experiences...ready for deep dish pizza, oh yes.I can remember my first pizza at Papa Del's as clearly as last night's. (Well maybe last night's is a little clearer because the leftovers are in my fridge.) You can go home again if home is for the best deep dish pizza this Illini fan has ever had.This is our eighth year of being the proud parents of U of I students and boy are we glad they weren't in college at the same time. Not to avoid double tuition payments but to stretch out those Papa Del's pizzas.When we come here after football games, we know it will be a huge wait. Before Basketball games is much easier. Last night I actually had allotted 2 hours and we were completely done in a little over an hour and had surprisingly good service. (It's a campus pizza place, 'nuff said for service expectations.)While you wait for your pizza you can talk to your family! Have an Italian salad and then some cheesy garlic bread. Then be prepared to fall in love and have an emotional affair with pizza that will last a lifetime.

<Content> BEST PIZZA IN TOWNLegendary in every sense of the word. If you are an upstate, chicago person you will probably turn your nose up to their deep dish saying "it isn't authentic, real chicago deep dish". But as far as I'm concerned, it is the best deep dish south of I-80.It isn't lou malnati's or giordano's but thats okay. Its delicious, high quality, awesome pizza. Famous for this sausage, but I still prefer their pepperoni. The deep dish will take ~40 mins to cook. So I always call ahead regardless of if I'm carrying out or eating in to make sure the pizza is ready when I get there. You haven't had the U of I experience until you've been to Papa Del's!

<Content> Among my favorite memories from my days as a student at Illinois would have to be when a professor saw me working on a project late one night in the lab and said "oh Hi Michael, we have some leftover pizza, want some?" And the leftover pizza turned out to be half a deep dish pizza from Papa Dels. That I devoured completely on my own. Oh sweet free deliciousness.Everybody has their own opinions about the best pizza in Chambanavoy. Unfortunately, many of them are wrong. Papa Dels is the best. Half a medium cheese deep dish is enough to kick my fat butt. However, it does take forever and it is fairly spendy.Eating in is not always awesome. Being that it takes them 45+ minutes to cook a pizza, you'll see a lot of people sitting around waiting for their pizza (since some people are silly enough not to call in their order ahead of time). This means that it can sometimes be tricky to get seated - due to all the people waiting (AKA Papa Del's noobs). Service ranges from mediocre to OK.Bathrooms are clean and they have toilet paper that is a step or two above the stadium grade/industrial sandpaper variety.Overall, I can't imagine Chambanavoy without Papa Del's. It is awesome. I wish it were cheaper and faster, but I also wish that I had Super Man's abilities. Can't have everything you want in life, you know? I guess I'm just going to have to drown my sorrows in another delicious Papa Del's pizza. Nom nom nom.

<Content> The best deep dish pizza ever. The first time I ate here I could only eat one slice. I have now graduated and can eat almost 3. I want to eat even more, but I can't handle it. We now order from the Crossing location since it is closer to home, but we used to pick-up from this location (they didn't deliver to our area). If you are going to sit down, a couple things to note. 1) parking sucks during busy periods. 2) It takes 45 min to cook the pizza...so you will have to wait. My family sent me a couple of their frozen pizzas through the mail service, but the pizzas do not cook the same at home. If you absolutely can't get good deep dish pizza wherever you are located, I can understand ordering it. Otherwise, just wait till the next time you are in Champaign to get some.

<Content> I am not a fan of Papa Del's although it is a Champaign staple. I was going to give 2 stars but i just couldn't do that. ALOT of people love Papa Del's and have for many ,many years. I am not one of them and I can't figure out why. It tastes fine. I just would not go out of my way to get one. They are big and heavy and take a long time to cook. Every time we have ordered one for work I have to wait when I arrive because it is still cooking. Every time. It's a messy kind of pizza too so maybe that's another reason I am not fond of it. I would not recommend it nor would I discourage anyone from trying. Seriously on the fence with this one.My advice is try it for yourself then decide what you think and Yelp about it.

<Content> Papa Del's has been one of my favorite dining establishments in Champaign (and THE best pizza) since I first tried it as a college freshman 34 years ago.Del's is most well known and well loved for its pan (thick) pizza. Though it is thick and cooked in a pan, I don't really consider this to be a Chicago deep dish pie, but I consider Del's pan pizza to be a style of its own. Though the pan pizza is good, I feel it is overrated by most patrons as it has a disproportionately high ratio of dough to toppings.My preference therefore is Del's thin, which I think is the unsung hero of the Papa Del's menu. Their thin pizza has a crust roughly 1/4 inch thick, which comes out from the oven crispy on the bottom and softened by the ingredients on top. To me, the thin pizza's proportion of dough to sauce, cheese, and other toppings is just about perfect.Normal cooking time for a thin is 30 minutes and for a thick (pan) is 45 minutes. Adjust these numbers upward if you are dining at a busy time, particularly on Illini home football game weekends.Del's serves excellent garlic bread which will tide you over between the time you sit down and the time your pizza is served. Service and the overall dining experience at Papa Del's can be spotty at times. The main dining room is a building whose tall ceilings and walls turns it into a bit of an echo chamber; the space would be improved by wall treatment that would deaden the sound. Groups of patrons are sometimes doubled up at the long tables with other groups of patrons, even when there's plenty of vacant dining space available, and the college-aged wait staff can be hard to flag down at times, though at other times they are attentive and responsive.For those reasons I order for pick-up (Papa Del's also offers delivery) more often than not. In any event, my fondness for Papa Del's is not about the service and dining experience; it's all about the pizza.

Personally, carry out is the best option so you don't have to wait 45 minutes for your deep dish pizza to bake. The Sicilian style pizza will continue to be a tradition on the University of Illinois campus.

I promise you, there is a dramatic difference. This is why you're yelp users. You should KNOW these things!This pizza, if ordered to-go, is the best pizza in the city, and probably that I've ever eaten. I now live in Chicago and I STILL crave this thing.

<Content> So, the food is so awesome here that I do not mind waiting an hour for a deep dish pizza to be served to me. I'll admit I'm a big fan of deep dish, and not everyone is...but I've also tried their regular crust pizza and it's also quite tasty. The seating is one of the drawbacks of this place though. Sometimes this place gets so packed that you can't get a seat for another half hour from when you arrived, BUT at least you can put your pizza order in and save time, which is great. It would be great if the place looked cleaner, but I don't really mind because the food is tasty.In my earlier post I said the waiters are pretty good. I TAKE THAT BACK!They are terrible. There is actually one girl in particular that is just obnoxious. When I came with a group of friends we made sure to order half vegetarian pizza and half meaty pizza. Sounds easy enough. Well, the waitress ended up bringing us a full meaty pizza and when I told her that's not what we ordered she said "I heard all meat" and walked away. SERIOUSLY? When she came back to fill our drinks my other friend got really pissed and said you could have at least offered to fix the problem...she just rolled her eyes and walked away. Finally, she ended up bringing a personal thin crust for my bf, but it was ridiculous the attitude she gave us. Isn't the customer always right? I clearly stated what we wanted on our pizza, is that so hard to understand?Despite the terrible service, I'd say this is the best pizza place in Urbana-Champaign, and sometimes even when I'm in Chicago i cannot help but get a craving for Papa Dels deep dish.

<Content> Amazing if the "inner fat kid" needs nourishment! So good but call and prep ahead if you are wanting 2 feed a crowd. These pizzas are a masterpiece and that takes time, but the wait is good for a delicious slice that weighs the amount of a new born!

<Content> Gosh, I hate to be a buzz kill, but this pizza is just plain thick. There's practically no flavor. I don't think it's just a Chicago thing. But it's a UIUC institution and I do enjoy going, but I usually have one of the entrees instead of pizza - that's why it gets the high three-star rating.However, cold, the next day, a slice of Del's makes for a decent lunch - I don't know what it is, it just tastes better to me that way.

<Content> Papa Del's is my favorite stuff crust pizza ever. Oh man... back when I was in school, it used to be a real treat to go here. Usually, if someone was visiting and had a car, this was one of the destinations. The pizza takes a LONG time to make, which is expected. But it's SO delicious.I live up in Chicago now, but I haven't forgotten you Papa Del's!!

<Content> Somehow, it took me till my last few weeks of undergrad at uiuc to go here. I was expecting the best Chicago style pizza in town, and yeah, it probably is. But it doesn't compete with Chicago-area Chicago style pizza so I must say I still was a little disappointing.I got a stuffed pizza with spinach. I felt like there could have been a lot more spinach on it, and something about the crust just didn't seem right. It was tasty and pretty soft, but the bottom was surprisingly hard and it seemed like the crust to pizza ratio was too high. Also, we got a loaf of garlic bread for the wait. It wasn't bad, but I've made better garlic bread at home. Some parts of the loaf were just too dry and bland. It was pretty cheap though, so no big deal.I guess overall, if you want a Chicago-style pizza, then go for it. But try to hit up a pizza place in the Chicago area sometime!

<Content> I've had better pizza in cleaner, more efficiently operated places, but it's hard to say Papa Del's isn't at least pretty good.  The menu is very, very limited.  If you don't want the Big Three toppings - pepperoni, cheese, sausage - you could have a plain crust, I guess, but there's no chicken, pineapple, Canadian bacon, steak, jalapeu00f1os or anything else even a millimeter away from conventional.  That said, the pizza was pretty good, if unoriginal.  The atmosphere of the place was lively.  Being able to pre-order is a stroke of genius - you put your name in for a table and your pizza order.  By the time you have a table, the food is on its way.  This place is a U of I tradition.  Far be it from me to diss Papa Del's.  However, like the Illini football team, Papa Dels could stand a little work improving their game.

<Content> Damn, just... damn...Great, great deep dish pizza. Comparable to Chicago pizzas (well, maybe better because is cheaper).The waiting is long, but give them a credit cause its said on the menu (45min minimum waiting). Well, if you go with friends, just order some pitcher and wait for it having a nice conversation.I've been here twice, and just loved.. the price is a bit out of the average cirty range, but its worth it.I would add that the price difference between the Original Sicilian Pan and the Suer Stuffed Pizza is not worth it. The super stuffed only comes with and extra layer of crust above the pizza. You get more by ordering a original sicilian with more toppings.

<Content> Hands down the BEST pizzeria in the Champaign-Urbana area. They are the only place around that serves authentic Chicago deep-dish pizza, though not exclusively; they also do excellent traditional thin crust pizzas as well as sandwiches and other appetizers. The campus location offers dine-in, delivery, or carry out. Be warned that the dine-in option is limited by space. All the tables are essentially crammed into a corner, which not only makes for a sometimes spatially uncomfortable seating arrangement, but also for a very unamusing game of who can shout the loudest to overcome the raucous echoes from other tables. Whether you dine in or out of the restaurant, expect a longer wait that usual. This isn't the usual pizza, so naturally it requires more than the usual time to prepare. Regardless, Papa Del's is worth experiencing - don't leave Champaign without doing so!

<Content> My brothers and I showed up in town for a Big 10 tournament from Chicago - so we relied on yelp to help us find a decent pizza restaurant in the area. Papa Del's listed great reviews for deep dish pizza - but we had just had our favorite in Chicago the night before so were actually looking for hand tossed or thin.Thanks to yelp, we ended up here.We called ahead for carry out rather than trying to figure out if they could deliver to our hotel. The pizza was perfect and the italian salad was too big to finish. The sausage on the pizza we ordered were like mini meatballs - almost too big for one bite.Everyone who works there is obviously a college student but very nice and helpful. The restaurant has a weird layout and was typical dirty bar/college with crumbs, straw wrappers, napkins on the floor...so get your food to go if this would bother you.

<Content> Horrible. Absolutely horrible.I stopped in for lunch. I had an hour. The garlic cheese bread was good, but didn't need to take forty five minutes to arrive, and my two slices pizza? forget it? And I'd have chalked it up to the pizza taking time, but then why did the two tables that came in after us and ordered similar slices GET SERVED FIRST!? Hell no.The service was...meh. They were friendly but clueless and were completely flustered when I said, "I'm late, I have to leave now."Worker: "But your pizza is ready now!"Teej: "Way late, but I'll take it to go."Worker: "Uh, wait, I'm gonna need a minute to change it up."Sweet Odin's Beard, woman! Put it in foil and a bag. It ain't that hard. UGH.You suck Papa Del's. And you know what else, I found the pizza to be...okay. I'm not from Chicago, I know, but I do like deep dish, and I found it to be only okay. Perhaps that's because I was rushing now to class late thanks to you, Papa Del's. You suck and I hate you.

<Content> I went with a large group of friends on Halloween weekend. Pretty much everyone except for me and Husband went to the U of I. The out-of-towners in for Halloween insisted there was only one true C-U place for lunch: Papa Del's! They lauded the deep-dish-by-the-slice. I was warned it would be crowded, but I'm willing to walk into the fires of Mt. Doom for some good pizza.My experience: Meh.So, I think that people really love Papa Del's because that's where they went in college. It brings back fond memories of late nights or drinking or whatever. I get that. I am very nostalgic for certain college hangouts of my own. However. Papa Del's pizza SUCKED.I might be a bit unfair in my review. It might be amazing if you get a fresh pie made. It could be incredible. But the slices we got at 1:30 pm (after 20 minutes wait)? SUCKED.They were hardly warm, yet still had dark-brown spots from spending too long waiting to be served. Husband had a sandwich, which he said was decent, but everyone had talked up this pizza. Said it was better than Vinny's, better than Rosati's, etc. WHAT. It wasn't inedible, but I was far from impressed.Service wasn't outright rude, but also wasn't fantastic. I get it, it's lunch rush on a Saturday. You're used to getting treated poorly by college kids. Still, I expect a certain level of positive attitude from waitstaff. I certainly don't want to be treated like I'm a burden upon you because I chose to eat at your restaurant.In my opinion, if you aren't a current UIUC student, or someone going for nostalgia, there are better pizza places on campus.

<Content> Given the generally positive reviews this place receives, I was very much looking forward to trying their Chicago style deep dish. However, I never got the chance because the service was so AWFUL!My wife and I arrived on a Saturday night at around 8pm, so, granted, it was a little busy. We told the hostess that we were looking for a table for two and, after lazily glancing around at about three tables, she told us there was nothing available and then just walked away! huh? Thankfully, a waiter came over shortly after and found us an open table in about 10 seconds. If only securing a table guaranteed actually being served food.We were seated at a table pushed up against a wall and behind another family (I won't dwell on the fact that the decor is atrocious and reminiscent of a high school cafeteria - with decibel levels to match). Well, perhaps because we were hidden behind another family or perhaps because of the staff's general inattentiveness, we were never waited on...nobody even came by to take a drink order. I understand from the reviews that the wait here can be long, so I was willing to give them some slack. However, waiting 20-25 minutes simply for someone to acknowledge your existence is absurd. We really had enough when we started seeing people who had come in after us get waited on as soon as they sat down. At that point we simply got up and left. Perhaps the pizza here is really good. I can't say for sure. But if I decide to try it again, it will definitely be for take out.

This place was a sheer Godsend in a town utterly devoid of quality food!! I was drowning miserably in the midst of constantly-disgusting and disappointing meals. I am sorry Champaign, but you have basically no good restaurants. All of the remaining eateries are either Asian restaurants and/or restaurants with chefs who don't know how to cook.So thaaaank you Papa Del's for your scrumptious fare! Loved the super fresh veggie toppings and hefty (MASSIVE) pizza sizes.Hope to be back soon!

<Content> Here's a secret: I will do anything for this pizza. Since every single person in Illinois seems to be some sort of self-crowned pizza expert, I'll tell you upfront: I'm not. I'm just a regular person who eats food. Sometimes I eat that food in Chicago. Most times I eat it in Portland. But in my 28 years of eating food, I've never eaten pizza that I like better than Papa Del's. The last time I was visiting, I even stuffed a frozen pizza into my checked luggage to take back to Portland, where I threw it in the oven a mere 90 minutes after my plane landed. What I mean to say is: this is special, special pizza.I'm seeing a lot of complaints about service, but that's missing the point. Does one complain about climbing a mountain to obtain wisdom from the guru at the top? (Actually, I probably would.) Yes, the service is miserable, but that's just part of the journey! There are two seating options to choose from while you wait (and wait, and wait): a sterile, cavernous dining room, or the small bar area, where the jukebox will inevitably be blaring an entire Journey album. Oh, neither of those suits you? Sheesh, why not ask Jesus to tidy up his manger while you're at it? The service has never improved at all during the 10 years I've been eating here, so it's futile to even spend time wishing it would; it's just what you have to deal with if you want the pizza.There is this part of the crust where the cheese sort of gets stuffed inside, and it's all gooey and amazing and occasionally I think about it when I'm supposed to be thinking of something else. I start eating each piece with a fork, but about 2/3 of the way up, I always just give in and eat it with my hands so I can best enjoy those precious bites that meld with the crust. The breadsticks are like giant loaves of bread, and you can get them with the pizza sauce or with this nacho cheese that I would normally reject outright, but for some reason it's amazing here. And really, I can only eat two slices, but sometimes I dare myself to go for three, and damn it if it isn't worth the stomach ache every time. What was it I said before? Oh, yes: this is special, special pizza.

<Content> I'm sorry everyone. Maybe it's not fair that I review this as I love thin crust pizza so much. Maybe it's also not fair that I was served after the pizza was delivered, and then I waited in line for several minutes. Maybe it was the ridiculous hype that everyone brought with it that was its downfall. With those things in mind: one of the worst... pizzas... ever.I took a quick picture on my phone (see: yelp.com/biz_photos/u8C8u2026) and sent it to a friend. He wrote back calling it bread lasagna. Maybe it wasn't very good because it had been sitting out for 5 or 10 minutes after being delivered. It had almost no flavor though. And it was ALL bread. I've had deep-dish before that was much better.I would be willing to try it again, fresh, at the restaurant; if I didn't live 1000 miles away.

<Content> I really wanted to give this place a better rating! I've heard amazing things about it, so maybe that raised my expectations.I went with a few friends and they called in our deep-dish half cheese, half green pepper and mushroom pizza about an hour ahead of time and it wasn't even ready when we got there. The waitress kept forgetting about us, it seemed, and the place was packed and not well-staffed enough for the amount of people here.Well, you guys know how I feel about customer service, so that would bring it down at least 1.5, if not 2, stars.The thing is, their pizza was awful! There was too much dough and not enough cheese; the sauce was a bit under-spiced in my opinion, and the vegetables on my half of the pizza were sparse and didn't taste fresh. I came in starving and didn't even eat a whole piece of pizza.I do remember, however, coming here years ago and really enjoying the thin crust pizza. I saw some other people with it and it looked and smelled a lot better than mine, too, leading to my decision to give Papa Del's two stars instead of one.Also, the bathrooms were clean.That's about all I have to say.

<Content> Two inch verticalTwo pounds of waist-line per slicePure deep dish delight(First, I must make an odd observation about Del's. I've NEVER, EVER, EVER been to a pizza shoppe that DIDN'T have 'suggested' pizzas on their menu! No "Hawaiian", "Supreme", or "Carnivore Lovers" pizzas here... if you don't bring your own inspiration, then you're SOL at Del's! The waiter gave me a funny look when I mentioned this, as if he'd never noticed this before. Strange...But back to the food... This place makes pretty solid deep-dish pizza. As with most deep-dish, it takes a while for it to come out, so plan your dinner time accordingly. We ordered a large pizza, and each slice was practically a meal in itself. It also reheated nicely the next day, which was a nice bonus. The pizza WAS moderately expensive, but worth it.Note: I wasn't as impressed with their cheese-bread appetizer as I was with their pizza. I wouldn't recommend it.One other POSITIVE noteworthy addition: I needed to break a $20 to get change for the parking meter. The server didn't have the exact change on him, so he just smiled, gave me 4 quarters, and said "Don't worry about it." I don't see this kind of generosity very much. It's only a buck, but it made my day. Needless to say, he received a handsome tip from me!)

<Content> We've tried Papa Del's twice and were disappointed both times. The first time we had the thin crust, and the second time we had the pan pizza. Both were just OK and we honestly do not feel we need to go back here again. The toppings selection is not only disappointingly short, but also overpriced. Our expectations are high coming from Gainesville, FL where they have Satchels, the most amazing pizza in the universe. We are still in search of a pizza place that we love enough to want to return to again and again in C-U. We haven't found it yet, but we like One World Pizza over Papa Del's pan pizza and Monicals wins out for value for a thin crust. It's sad that Monicals could beat a local favorite for us.

<Content> You know Papa Del's must be good when the owner of the place can be so, so rude to customers and they keep on coming back for more. The Papa Del's horror stories that I know of first-hand and have heard (all from reliable sources) range from being hung up on over the phone while trying to order take-out to customers actually having their cars towed from the parking lot. And still, I am giving Papa Del's four stars. Why? Because everytime I bite into that first thick bite, I am once again surprised by it's woderful deliciousness.Papa Del's is to pizza what a wife-beater is to marriage. They'll break you down and disrespect you, yet somehow they have the power to keep you crawling back, begging for more. Please don't leave me Papa Del's! I have been blacklisted from the delivery list once before (long story, I learned my lesson) and I never want to go back there again!If loving you is wrong, Papa Del's, well then, Baby, I don't ever want to be right.

I've never had a type of pizza there I dislike. Last time I had spinach and fresh garlic which was fantastic, though I usually order plain cheese or sausage. Note: If you're on a time crunch, either don't go here, or call in your order ahead of time. They warn you it takes 55 minutes, and it really does take that long... if not longer. It's worth the wait, if you have the time.

<Content> Don't come here if you have any sort of time constraints. The only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because I didn't actually get to taste the food. I came here for lunch knowing that there would probably be a wait. But, I was craving some chicago style pizza, and I had an hour so I thought I'd be fine.I walk in and stare at the 2 workers in the place for 5 minutes. Finally he asks "Can I help you?" Something about the way he said it just rubbed me the wrong way. It felt like he thought I was intruding upon his precious time. Granted, the restaurant was pretty full, and they seemed understaffed so I just asked for a table. He told me to "sit tight", which I did. I sat tight for at least 15 minutes without anyone paying any more attention to me. An update on time would have been really nice. Even just saying a word to remind me that I hadn't become invisible would have been appreciated. Of course they were too busy running past me to say anything though. After wasting 20 minutes of my lunch break, I gave up and left.Hopefully I can come back and actually try the food. But, the service here is really poor from what I can tell. The pizza better be amazing; otherwise, I don't think I'll be tempted to come back here.

<Content> Best pizza I have ever had, anywhere (yes I have been to the popular pizza joints in Chicago). My all time favorite pizza place. Thick crust is awesome. Sicilian Pan all the way, and love the stuffed pizza as well. The building is old, right next to the smelly and often flooded Bone Yard Creek. The place is kind of dirty, and it takes forever. Though who cares when they make pizza this good? Thick crust is obviously where it is at, and my experience with pizza places is they either do thick or thin crust good. They usually don't do both. Though I have always enjoyed the thin crust here as well. Crispy, buttery, garlicy crust that is homemade, as is the house made sausage. An institution on Green St that I hope never closes.

<Content> For full disclosure purposes, I worked at Del's in the early 'Nineties. I stopped in a couple of weeks ago and was in heaven from the heady smell and the curiously identical everything else! Pops is still making some of the best Deep Dish anywhere.The decor is dated, the pies take forever in that five-deck oven, and the service is a bit lackluster. But the food is great old school pizzeria. Get the Italian Salad as an appetizer. Proceed to the Sicilan Pan pizza (although the Stuffed and Thin are solid--just not as good). Not fancy, brother. Just tasty.  Still good cold the next day. Bank on it.

<Content> The best Chicago-style pizza anywhere is not in Chicago. On one trip to Illinois we had Lou Malnati's, Pizzeria Uno and Giordano's pizza, aka the trifecta. Then we visited my family in Champaign and grabbed a couple of slices of cheese pizza to go from Papa Del's before driving to O'Hare. We inhaled them in the car, and I swear, that beat those fancy Chicago places hands down. I love all kinds of pizza...East Coast, West Coast, you name it...but when it comes down to it, it's Pop's for pizza or no place at all ;-)Oh yeah, and order take out. Don't judge this place by the dining experience; just get the pizza. I lived in C-U for the first 17 years of my life and have gone back once or twice a year for the last 20. Of the hundreds of Papa Dels pizzas I've had, I can probably count the number of times I've eaten there on 2 hands. Who cares?

Especially those of you knocking it down because of its service... here's the thing... you go to Papa Del's for the best pizza you have ever eaten. You want fast service? Go get a pizza at Pizza Hut express and leave one more table open at Papa's...The secret is, call ahead. It does take 45 to 55 minutes for them to cook a pizza, that's how good (and thick) they are. This place is, hands down, my favorite pizza ever... however if you are especially anal about service, just get it delivered. Whatever you do though, if you are in Champaign, don't leave town without tasting this true circle of cheest awesomeness.

<Content> This would probably be a five-star for me, but I am trying not to include nostalgia in the review. There are two things to tell you.If you haven't eaten here and are reading this review, then you are probably from out of town. The one thing I can say that might influence your decision is this: the stuffed pizza here is better than any I can find in Chicago. Honestly, I have tried everything and keep looking. Stuffed pizza, foodie pizza, local pizza - none better. That should be all I need to say.But once you get there the other thing you need to know is this: the service is epic slow. Remember when you studied The Odyssey in school and the teacher told you about the oral tradition and it not being written down for a few centuries? That is how they train the waitstaff here. For decades the means of serving people in a lovingly slow and sometimes forgetful fashion have been passed down to new staff with such fidelity that I can only call the institutional memory involved Homeric. Embrace it as part of the experience and realize that the name tags are hand written, the one old thing about the staff is that almost everyone seems new. The pizza will eventually be delivered, be patient, it will be worth the wait.

<Content> Hands down, the best of the best. The smell alone will carve a hole in your stomach, it's so good, esp when you are hungry. I started with PD's in 1980 at UIUC, then left UIUC in 84, and came back several times for, er, 'business reasons', but the truth, I now admit, was to eat another deep dish Papa Dels pie... that's how damn good they are. Don't bother taking a frozen home...I tried that and wept it was so not the real thing. The tomato sauce and the crust are some special recipe, for which if I could get ahold of it, I would start Papa Dels Silicon Valley and make trillions.

<Content> Went out to this pizza joint with my swim team hoping for decent pizza. I was incredibly happy to find that the pizza was delicious. I ordered the signature pan pizza with pepperoni. It was everything you love about Chicago-style deep dish pizza down in Champaign. Unfortunately, the meal takes a long time to be served. We sat down at 4:40 and didn't get out good until 5:45 rolled around. Quickie review: Go here whenever you can! Food-wise Papa Del's is some of the best Champaign can offer.

<Content> I subscribe very strongly to the belief that bad pizza does not exist. Even the worst pizza is, at the very least, edible.That said, Papa Del's, which should be near the top of the pizza pantheon falls squarely short of mediocre. I know I'm in a very, very small minority here but honestly, I'd just as soon get Pizza Hut. It's cheaper and doesn't take as long. For me, the taste is about the same.Part of this could be my status as a "thin-crust guy" but even after trying their thin crust, I wasn't impressed. Besides the sauce being of the persuasion that induces heart burn 90% of the time for me, the crust wasn't like a cracker, but more like cardboard. I won't comment too much on the deep dish, but I will say that the sausages were nice and crispy which is something I'd like to see more on pizza in general. The crust, which should be the best part of deep dish was kind of chewy......for me. I'm not the definitive pizza reviewer.I would give this place three stars; however, minus one star for service, which was really bad. We had a large group and one of the servers in particular was rather abrasive when we asked to have a large table. Our main server didn't do a good job either of keeping drinks filled, which normally is not a pet peeve for me, but when I've gone an hour sans fill up, I tend to get cranky.

<Content> I LOATHE Deep Dish Pizza. I have grown up in the Chicago metro area and have enjoyed most of the staples, like vienna beef hot dogs, italian beef, and gyros. However, I am a minimalist when it comes to pizza, and so, I like as few things on it as possible. The very concept of deep dish pizza goes against this philosophy of mine, almost to the point where I wouldn't even consider it pizza at all.Regardless of that, I will gladly eat a medium sausage deep dish style pizza from Papa Del's any day. Yes, Papa Del's serves the only deep dish pizza I will eat anywhere. I think that's a good enough endorsement.Don't overlook their thin crust pizza, though. It's every bit as good as the deep dish in my opinion and it's a solid option for the lighter appetites.I can't really say the service itself is bad like all of the other reviewers are saying. However, you will probably wait at least 45 minutes if you are ordering a pizza of any kind, so be warned.

<Content> Truly authentic Chicago style pizza! My boyfriend is from Chicago and although we now live in central Indiana, we still love a good Lou Manalti's pie when we get a chance.We had never been here before, and although it was about 7pm on a Saturday night, we were able to get a table without a wait. There was, however, quite a wait before a server came by to take our order; it was probably 15 minutes and then we finally just flagged someone down.Boeyond that, everything was great. We ordered a pan pizza and after an hour (which they tell you is the wait time for a pan pizza), it was brought out in all its glory. It was amazing. Just like a Manalti pizza exept it lacked the one thing I HATE about most Chicago style pizzas - the chunky sauce! The sauce was smooth but flavorful and full of spices. I cannot stand chunky pizza sauce so I was very excited. It was SO GOOD. The slices were so thick and loaded that I was full after just one. We ended up taking more than half the pie home.Our dining partners had the "thin crust", and I use quotes because it really was what I would consider to be hand tossed in thickness. It looked wonderful and I would like to try it next time.All in all, worth the wait. The building is set up oddly but they make it work. There is a full bar and the menu also includes pastas and sandwiches if you are not feeling a pizza.

<Content> Chicago-style pizza is a religious sort of thing. Maybe you think Gino's East is the best, maybe Giordano's. Maybe you think that Papa Del's can't possible compare. All that's fine if you're willing to make a five-hour pilgrimage every time you want to eat pizza.But most people aren't, so it's good that Papa Del's is at least in the ballpark. This is really great pizza, and easily the best Chicago-style you're going to get in Champaign.Plus they've got a deep-dish by-the-slice on weekdays for lunch.

<Content> It's Pops for Pizza or No Place at All. Seriously - this is the best pizza you will ever have - deep dish, that is. And yes, I've had Chicago pizza at the "institutions" and this is still way better. Beware though, the place is insane on weekends and it takes 45 minutes to bake a pie so call ahead if you think you're going to be bored talking to your table-mates for that long. I would give Papa Dels 5 stars but the last 3 times I've been there, the service has sucked - not the rude sucky, but they have jacked up our order every time! We want thick, they give us thin. We wanted pepperoni, they give us sausage. This last time we asked to see the manager and tried to at least get a free 'za out of it - "no free food here - owner's policy," he says. Normally this would piss me off so much I would never go back, but the pizza is just so damn good I do anyway. Sigh.

<Content> This is what pizza is supposed to be. Thick, chewy, substantial, no-nonsense, DELICIOUS. The Platonic ideal. They have a thin-crust pizza but honestly I've never bothered, nor has anyone else I know. I'm not sure what the point would be. They lack one star because every so often the bottom of the crust is burned horribly. Sad!!

<Content> OH yeah.....you know that Chicago Style Pizza is the only kind of pizza that can be called a meal. New York Style, that is a lunch kind of pizza. If you want a real meal, then Deep Dish is what you want. And if you can't get to Chicago to have some Lou Malnatti's and are in Champaign / Urbana then you have to go to Papa Del's.Just beware, this delectably deep dish pie takes 55 minutes to bake. If you are hungry and need the quick hit of Chicago's best food then call ahead. But if you are like me and can let a great meal take its due course, you can order a pitcher of your favorite brew and enjoy that while taking it easy and conversating with your friends. After all, Deep Dish Pizza is all about sharing, because no man, and I mean no man can tackle a Large Deep Dish Sausage by himself.The only reason why this place gets a 4 instead of a 5 is because their Shiner Bock was flat, the service was not so great, and they are not in Chicago. If these things were remedied, they would easily be a 5 star, but sadly rural Illinois is not Chicago....

<Content> Born and raised in Chicago eating Chicago style pizza. As a loyal Lou Malnatti patron, I can support Papa Del's stuffed pizza. Takes 45-55 minutes which is just a fact that has to be accepted. They have great sausage that they cook before making the pizza which provides a great carmalised crispy texture and taste that adds another layer of experience.Had Papa Del's in college 20 years ago and went back with my daughter this week and it is the same. Great to see it serving up the same great pie.Lunch time they sell pre-made pizza by the slice. Pan pizza with one topping but gets you quick pizza without the wait. But the stuffed pizza is not offered.If you like greesy pizza or are a thin pizza fan then Papa's isn't for you. But don't rate it then. Like rating an Sushi place down because you don't like raw fish.

<Content> First, let's correct a slight misconception. This is not exactly Chicago-style pizza. Although it may not seem possible to those whose conception of pizza centers on the east coast or California styles, Papa Del's thick crust is noticeably doughier, thicker, heavier, and more casserole-like than anything being served at a classic Chicago-style pizza place. Our of respect for pizza aficionados, I have to note that there's a slight difference in kind, not degree, between what Giordano's serves and what Papa Del's serves.But second, it's still fantastic pizza. It may seem pricey, but an 8-piece thick crust pizza can easily serve 4-6 because the slices are so filling and thick (it can feed 7 if you're like me and always have 6 sorority girls on diets hanging out with you). The tomato sauce is delicious and perfectly-spiced and with the doughy crust it forms almost a focaccia taste (like a real focaccia taste and not what you get at Friday's). The meat toppings are the best (bacon, pepperoni, and sausage are all great). I would advise against getting onions, as they can overpower the rest of the pizza, but it's still very, very good thick-crust pizza and it's well worth the lengthy wait.It's not a 5-star because the dine-in service/experience is poor. I strongly, strongly recommend getting take-out. Also note the calender; if it's an Illinois home football or basketball game, call 60-90 minutes in advance and do not try to eat-in. And the thin crust is lousy.

<Content> This is the legendary stuff in CU. Some people love it, some tolerate it, but many yearn for it years after they leave campus. The place can get very busy, I usually call ahead and carry out since the space itself is loud and frankly not too memorable. I love the tomato sauce and cheese taste. Many people overlook the thin crust, which I like, esp. when I don't want the volume of the pan. The stuffed is too much for me. Surprisingly, the sandwiches are a cut above what you would expect at a place like this - an afterthought. A note: Years ago they used to have a location on Wright. St. where they sold sandwiches and slices. That was nice, and convenient. Wish they could do something like that again. Maybe take over the McDonald's spot in the Union food court. Honestly - how could McDonald's not be successful there? It seemed busy whenever I was there.

<Content> not the best pizza i've ever had, but easily the best deep dish you'll find within a 50 mile radius. sure the menu looks pricey, but i'm all about the deals. they have a pizza happy hour type deal, where single slices are half price (until they run out) from 3-4pm. that means $1.50 for a huge slice of sausage. WOWZA. ask for extra pizza sauce when they bring out your order. i'm a carb lover, but the crust is even too much bread for me.for appetizers... the soft bread sticks are my fave. warning, they're HUGE. gotta go with the nacho cheese and pizza sauce to accompany it.

<Content> I've had stuffed pizza all over and I have to say that this is still my favorite (stuffed, mind you...), by far. Every so often when I'm in town I grab a large super stuffed with mushrooms, sausage, and spinach home. The ingredients are fresh and the sauce is very well balanced with just a bit of tang. That, and they practically put huge chunks of sausage in there.... if they just had whole mushrooms instead of sliced, that would rock.

<Content> Yeah, this pizza is amazing. The deep dish pizza is a long wait - at least 45 minutes - but you can call ahead to get your pizza started. Highly recommended. But you can load the pizza with all kinds of toppings, and they're baked right into the copious amounts of cheese they give you. Couple that with a buttery, flaky crust that you are seriously happy to eat, and you have a winning pie.Pair the pizza with some cheesy garlic bread to start the meal, and the attentive service will keep your drink full while you wait. Anytime I go back to Champaign, I gotta have Papa Del's.

<Content> The big daddy of pizzas. The Sicilian style pizza is a monstrosity of a pie. Starting from the bottom, there's, a thick, yeasty bread crust. On top of that there's a layer of oozing mozzarella cheese. On top of that are the toppings - sausages the size of meatballs, onions, peppers, whatever, and then there's a sweet tomato sauce slathered over the top of everything. OMG! There's no delicate way to eat this beast! This is the pizza that made U of I famous!

<Content> Compared to Gino's East in downtown Chicago, this place gets 4 stars.Compared to everywhere else that sells deep dish pizza, this place is easily 5 stars.The deep dish is done right at Papa Del's. Lot's of tasty toppings, cheese, and sauce piled on top of the crispy crust. Don't let other "deep dish" joints fool you. It's not just a thick slab of dough. If done well, the dough is relatively thin because all the fillings are held inside.I have a friend who brings home 2 Papa Del's pizzas back to St. Louis to his parents every time he goes home because they went to Illinois back in the day, and they just can't stop eating it. That's quality!

<Content> During our visit, we ordered their pan pizza. It wasn't very busy but the wait was still 45 mins (I can't imagine what the time would be if it was during the busy hours). The pizza was great, superb! It was the thickest pizza I have ever had and can understand why the wait is what it is. I live in the north suburbs of Chicago, and my favorite pan pizzas are Silo and Lou Malnati's. It is hard to choose which I like more, but this was a nice change from my standard. A side salad and one piece was plenty. They offer pizza by the slice but then you won't have any leftovers. That's no fun!They have their own parking in the back so you don't have to feed the meter.

So sit back with your friends and/or family, and enjoy spending time with them, while you wait for the amazing pizza that's sure to please everyone. And it's worth the wait (and any potentially awkward conversations you must endure. You only came with a group because no one can eat a whole Papa Del's pizza by themselves! And who wants to sit alone at a restaurant? (On the other hand, who wants to share something this delicious?) ) I kid, but seriously, it's worth it!If you leave this place still hungry....you are doing something very very wrong. (Unless you got your food to-go, because you won't have eaten it yet!!)It is scrumptious. I don't know what I like more...the cheese, or the sauce? It's different than anything I've ever had.Every time I've been here, it's been crowded, or at the very least, it's busy. That's always a good sign!

<Content> Based on the testimonials from other Yelpers, sounds like it was a good call to enjoy Papa Del's from the comforts of my in-law's home. We had champagne to accompany our Chicago-style pizza, which is my new favorite eating-take-out-at-home thing - the champagne and pizza combination, not necessarily Chicago-style.It's like eating a pie o' pizza and, apparently, Papa Del's does it better than most joints in The Windy City. Stuffing is entirely customizable and we were treated to a sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers and onions smorgasbord. My mom-in-law also raves about a spinach something or other.PRO'S: Eat less to feel satiated, didn't seem as oily.CON'S: Gotta use utensils to eat hot (just had some cold for lunch, sans fork and knife).Sorry Papa, this is one time I'm picking a girl over a guy - I'll forever be enamored to my Hot Mama's.

We were young, naive, and whined about the wait. But as soon as we finally tasted the pizza, we were believers. I've has Chicago style pizza... and this isn't a substitute, it is the best. This is, hands down, my favorite pizza in the world. My family drives 2 hours out of the way on an 18 hour car trip to SC just to stop for Papa Del's on the way down, in the middle of the night.Homecoming is a month away and my mouth is watering just thinking about this place!!!

<Content> It's the best pizza I have ever had. I haven't found any pizza that comes close to it. The buttery crust, delicious sauce, generous cheese - it just comes together superbly. If you're a vegetarian (the grease from the pepperoni/sausage does magical things) or like thin crust or are cheap - don't bother. A lot of the 1 star peeps are talking about service. The service is sketchy at best - I would always call ahead and pick-up. It's so worth it. If anybody knows a place in Chicago that is as good - let me know. Malnati's and Giordano's - they're good, but not as good...

I've only been in the restaurant once, and it was nice and relaxed. I've ordered delivery from them countless times whenever I have guests, and it never disappoints. Melty, cheesy, tomatoey...so good. It's kind of pricey, but I usually just eat one to two pieces and am completely stuffed, so it's really not bad.

Be ready to wait for your pie, it takes a solid 45 minutes to bake this pizza. But it is worth every minute! They do delivery, take out, and dine in at this location. The other location is only pickup and delivery. Wait staff is friendly, quick, and proficient, some of them have been there for years. Make sure you get the Sicilian style, if you get thin you're doing it wrong.

<Content> Papa D's, as I like to call it, is the most awesomest (deep-dish) pizza in Champaign, if you order 90 minutes before you're hungry. Papa Del's is an institution in Champaign-Urbana. I've read reviews that say it's not as good as Chicago's own Chicago-style. To that I say Bull-hocky! You're just hating on Champaign because you're here for school and you miss you're hometown! I've had Papa D's deep dish and Gino's East in Chi-town. Side-by-side I don't think I could tell the difference. I've never ordered a thin crust or a sandwich at Papa D's so I can only speak to their most beloved menu item, the Super-Stuffed pizza. (The pizza President Clinton ordered when Air Force One landed in Champaign). I have nothing to say other than it's awesome. It's great. It's the bee's knees. It's the spider's web. (does that last one make sense?). Seriously though, if you like stuffed pizza, get a Papa Del's sausage (or pepperoni) and spinach (unless you hate spinach). Two big draw backs to Papa D's: It's on campus. So us townies can wait to sample it's offers three times a year (spring break, summer break, and winter break), or, or!, order from the NEW, NEW! location at Village at the Crossing (you're welcome Papa D, call (217) 359-5500). I've never ordered from that location, but I've eaten that location's pizza and it's just as awesome as the Green street location, minus the students and traffic.The other big drawback is the delicious deep-dish takes a while to create and bake, so you have to be patient or order ahead of time. If you dine-in at the Green Street location you can plan on waiting 90 minutes if you're in a large group. Alone or in a smaller group the usual wait time is closer to 45 minutes. If you order-out or arrive when the students are gone you can expect to wait less. BOTTOM LINE:Great food + long wait time - fair price - "I can't believe you haven't tried this already" = worth it. If you live in Champaign more than a year and you like pizza, I won't respect you if you haven't at least tired Papa D's (stuffed pizza).

<Content> This is hands down my favorite pizza place. Every time I come back to visit my hometown, I make sure to order a large Sicilian pan pizza with sausage, garlic, and black olives, with a side of pepperoncinis. Delivery time is usually 60-75 minutes, and I don't mind the wait because the pizza is heavenly.

<Content> I've had a million good experiences here, and only one bad. Ordered a thin crust here once, for pickup, and I sat and waited for it near the counter while they overcooked it. But I don't know what possessed me to order thin-crust anyway. I had never done it before and never will again, because their deep pizzas (they have both pan and stuffed) are EASILY the best in Champaign-Urbana. The crust is a lot like Giordano's. Every time I'm back in Chambana I have to get Del's.

<Content> Best pizza in champaign/urbana hands down. No one else is even close to Papa Del's pan pizza. I get a pie with sausage and mushrooms and i can't ask for much more in my pizza, for some strange reason, i find the pizza is even better warmed up the next day as a leftover than it is freshly served.Want to try some sandwiches as well, but have a hard time getting past the pizza.

<Content> This University of Illinois campus fixture has the "best" Sicilian pizza due to the crust, cheese, sauce & sausage -- not to short change any of the other additional ingredients (pepperoni, mushrooms, etc) or the "thin" pizza, or the cheese garlic bread, or the...OK, I'm a fan... since the late 70s (oh, am I showing my age). A proof point is that while driving Columbus, OH to Chicago I went through Champaign just to pick up a pie to go.4 stars, versus 5 is due to the ongoing problem of "table management" during rush periods where tables will be "empty" between seatings while there is a line of people waiting out the door & around the corner.That being said, once seated, service has been consistently good through the "generations" of waitstaff that we have had. And other than football weekends, seating has not been a problem. The bar is fairly well stocked.Oh, this last round, I had bacon and it was 1/4 strips on the pie -- FANTASTIC.

<Content> I had heard about Papa Del's and was excited to try it after reading the reviews. I ordered a pepperoni, sausage and mushroom (my go-to pizza). The parking was difficult to find because it's on the side of the building. Up the stairs is where you pay and when I got up there, the service was not very friendly. After paying and walking to my car, I noticed that the grease from the pizza was ooozing out of the box and dripped onto my jeans. I was fairly pissed about that, not only did it stain my jeans, but I knew I ordered a greasy pizza.Deep dish pizza was pretty good, but there was soo much sauce and not enough cheese. I usually enjoy pizza, equally if not more on the second day of eating it, and this pizza was not very good on day two. Overall, I'm not sure if I would go back, but I'm glad that I tried it. I think there are better pizzas around town.

<Content> Some of the best pizza you can get in CU. Pizza can take quite a while to cook, so be prepared to wait (but it's totally worth it).Most of my experience with Papa Del's Pizza is actually through info sessions held by companies on campus - the promise of a hearty slice of Papa Del's is enough to lure many into the room. Just one slice is a filling meal. Would definitely recommend!

<Content> I am not from Champaign-Urbana, however I visit every other year or so and never miss the opportunity to eat at Papa Del's. I seriously have dreams about their deep dish with everything on it. The crust is so tasty, the toppings are fresh and yummy. I love the big sausage chunks and garlic, and the tomato chunks in the sauce...sure it might take a long time, but that's why you can call ahead and order a pizza and a table so you don't have to wait as long when you get there! I read other complaints about slow waitstaff?...who cares? Get a beer, bring a friend, relax and enjoy yourself!I am tempted to try their overnight shipping so I can get my Del's fix in Texas. Maybe for my birthday...

<Content> Papa Del's is my favorite pizza restaurant, and definitely worth the wait. For delivery, I've experienced it taking everywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours to arrive, but I'd say it is most often 45-60 minutes. If you are planning to dine in at the restaurant, I would recommend calling the restaurant about 20 minutes before you plan to be there to pre-order your pizza. This significantly cuts down on your waiting time at the restaurant. Take out is the fastest option. My pizza has always been ready within 45 minutes of placing my order.The deep dish "pan" pizza is their specialty. The toppings are always fresh and delicious. I order garlic on every pizza I get from Papa Del's because it is just so fresh and delicious. I'm not a big sausage fan, but I enjoy theirs very much. My favorite combination of toppings to get is garlic, sausage, black olives, and green peppers. Yum.

<Content> Papa Del's provides the best Chicago-style pizza outside of the Chicago metropolitan area. It is a must have for pizza fans who live in Central Illinois. The main location offers dine in, pick up, and delivery and is located on Green street in Campus Town. A new location has also opened up that offers pick up and delivery services. You can purchase frozen pizzas, but they rarely cook as well at home.PROS: Delicious pizza, reasonably priced for groupsCONS: Slow preparation time (45 minutes for thick crust), waiters aren't always the most attentive, restaurant atmosphere is nothing special

<Content> Let me start by saying: I LOVE this pizza! Ok, that's where the love stops. The service is terrible. Not just terrible, awful even! You arrive, you place your order. You enjoy a beer, maybe another. The server comes back to get your order. Wait, I already ordered? You place it again, waiting...waiting. Finally, after an eternity, a manager comes out: "she forgot to put your pizza order in." Really? Seriously? After placing it twice? We order again. 40 minutes later, we get a pizza. It's delicious. But, we could have been in Chicago for the time it took to get. And then, at least, we would have been in Chicago. I "suppose" if you like to complain and feel you want to wait a small eternity for a pizza (that's delicious!) go to Papa Del's. However, if you've had your fill of being treated poorly, find somewhere else!

<Content> The pizza is good, the closest thing to Chicago deep dish in the area as far as I know.The problem with this place is that the owner/manager shows complete contempt for the customers. There are signs posted all over the place admonishing customers for this, that, and the other. They will actually tow their customers cars if they park in one of the spots closest to the back entrance which they reserve for their delivery drivers (aside: isn't it customary to have your employees park at the far end of the lot to reserve the good spots for your customers?) The first time I went in to pick up a pizza, I was a bit taken aback bu the "get the f out" vibe. Since then, I've heard a lot of horror stories from employees and customers about the way the owner treats people. My favorite involved kicking out a family with an infant for bringing in outside food to feed the baby. The kid had a bag of freakin' Cheerios. I heard this from an assistant manager who ended up quitting because they just couldn't deal with having to treat people that way anymore.I've given up the tasty pizza on the premise that I'm really doing the owner a favor. He clearly hates his customers, so now I'm one less thorn in his side.

<Content> I went here recently with some classmates for the first time and had an awful experience. We had a large group and ordered several deep dish pizzas. The others came out as expected, but as their pizzas came to the table our waitress realized she had forgotten to put in the order for a deep dish pizza my friend and I were splitting. This is a pretty big mistake to make considering it takes a good 45 minutes to an hour to make a deep dish. What's worse is what happened after that. Instead of offering to bring us an appetizer on the house or something to hold us over (I was pretty starving at this point and we had already been there for an hour) she simply says "I would understand if you don't tip me, I'm sorry" and offered to make us a thin crust instead. I don't care for thin crust pizza so I declined and said we would just wait. About fifteen minutes later she comes by and offers some garlic bread so we accepted that. However, she waited so long to offer it that we got it just before our pizza came out and we no longer wanted it. Basically it was just a really frustrating experience and the waitress could have been more helpful considering it was her big mistake. I also didn't realize that it costs $4 for a Diet Coke. I mean, it's a large cup, but c'mon. That's pretty steep even with getting a refill. On top of that, when we got our pizza, I was not impressed. For the time I spent here, I could have just driven to Chicago and had a real deep dish pizza. It might be the best in Champaign, but I don't think it's worth waiting for.

<Content> This is the most deplorable service I have experienced from a pizza joint. I live 3.4 miles away. I am living supposedly one road away from the delivery service "cutoff" (It is an 11 minute drive according to google maps). I said that I was willing to walk out of my neighborhood (maybe 100 yards) to that road. They would not deliver, saying that they were already busy enough. Well, when the time comes when you don't have as many orders booked, Papa Del's, don't count on mine. The person who I talked to on the phone tonight was rude and incredibly unhelpful. Based on this experience, even though I liked the pizza when I tried it, I don't plan on patronizing this establishment again.

<Content> During a recent trip to Champaign, I decided to stop by this well rated deep dish pizza spot. Papa Del's is the real thing, and it is really good. The sausage is as good as everyone says and the deep dish is the perfect thickness (i.e. crisp crust, soft chewy crust with a thin layer of dough topped by cream thick cheese). I also tried the large meatballs and marinara sauce (which is something I picked up after living out east) and it was awesome.  The meatballs were super flavorful and the sauce had the perfect sweetness. If you're in the Champaign area, Papa Del's should be a definite stop on your Campus tour.

<Content> In moments of weakness, we will order Papa Del's to go and it's worth it every time. The deep dish crust is thick but not greasy, which makes it perfect for scooping up the marina sauce in the pizza. The pizza toppings are very generous and high quality. The downside, of course, is that one must wait for a very long time if they want a deep dish. Fortunately, the thin crust pizza is also good but not very memorable.

<Content> Very good deep dish pizza. Unlike Chicago-style deep dish, this crust is not flaky and buttery like a Lou Malnati's pie, but it's still very good- just a different style. The sauce is a bit sweet for my taste, but still good. The cheese is good (seems to be just mozz). They seem to use high quality toppings (have only had the pepperoni and sausage). Call ahead to place your order (menu on eatcu.com) so you don't have to wait an hour at the restaurant. It doesn't seem particularly clean....but I guess that's to be expected for an on-campus eatery that caters to easily satisfied students.

<Content> Papa Del's is the shit. Hands down the best pizza in Champaign. The pizza they make there is delicious the service is awesome. I agree with the dude from Peoria, AZ, if you want fast service, do go to pizza hut. What separates Del's pizza to Hut's pizza is the attention to detail the pizza you eat at Del's gets. There is a process t making their pizza. True can be said of Pizza Hut's, but Del's is deliberate and the end product is a pizza you can be proud to eat. I have eaten here 3 times and I loved it every time. Not only is the pizza delish, the place is immaculate. Walking in the restaurant, you are transported out of Central Illinois and to a different region of the world. There is a great contrast and this adds to the experience. There is a fountain, the tiles look like its from Italy, the two storied dining area gives the place a cool feel to it.The pricing is just right. True, to a person used to eating at Antonio's, Pizza Hut, or Sbarro, the pricing may seem high, but consider the quality of food compared to Papa Del's- not even close. So, it is well worth the extra few dollars to eat here. Plus the pizza is so damn filling. So, when you think about it, you are paying for your food for the day and possibly tomorrow.The only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because although they do accept credit cards in the store; they do not accept then for ordering out. I called there and I got less than desirable service. I wanted pizza to order out one day because I was too lazy to leave my apartment, but whatever, I wound up just walking back to the restaurant and ordering my food there. They should accept credit cards over the phone. But, that's about all I have to complain about. To summarize,Best- Great food, excellent service, unique looking place, big portions, reasonable priceWorst- Don't accept credit Cards over the phone

<Content> After graduating from UIUC Grad School, I often go to sleep thinking about this place. Their thin crust pizza's are my favorite. I also get the Italian Salad to go with it. They have excellent beers in bottle and on tap. I miss the days on a wintry night, either during or after the blizzards, where a cold beer and a hot pizza combo seem to do the trick to fill the void of the depressing winters. I can't thank them enough for helping me get through a tough time period in my life by serving a great pizza and beers. I came here alone to do my readings by the fire pit or with my peers for a social night. Either way, both types of customers are welcome.

I generally prefer pick-up and just eat at home with friends and a movie or game.Papa Dels has two styles of pizza - thick and thin - both are excellent. So if you don't like Chicago style, don't forget to try their thin variety.

<Content> On rating pizza alone I would give papa dels 10 stars, it is that good, especially their stuffed pizza! However their service and restaurant are terrible. The restaurant is laid out like a dormitory's cafeteria and equally loud. The bar area is somewhat better but whoever designed that restaurant was an idiot. Loud, bright, annoying. Second, delivery. We live near Vine street in Urbana and they consider that out of their delivery area? What?? It used to be (and may still be I haven't checked) that you could not order the stuffed pizza ahead if you were eating there which meant you sat there, using up a table, for a full hour waiting for your amazing pizza. Customers are definitely not their first priority but fortunately amazing pizza is. I recommend pick up.

The sauce if very flavorful, and the crust can take it. I prefer eat in, and never really got papa del's for delivery, but did carry out occasionally. It does suffer from sogginess when put in that cardboard box, better eaten fresh on location on a plate with a knife and fork. Not the cheapest pizza in Champaign, just the best.

If you have to drop your son or daughter of at U of I, you can still expect first class pizza...BEST tip I can give you is ORDER AHEAD...takes a long time(they do say it on the menu, about the time, but still does not make it easier watching everyone around you shovel in very tasty pizza)-salads are decent...service is so-so...not dirt cheap but not crazy expensive...pizza is wonderful...

<Content> Got one of their pizza's to take home since I was in town. It was pretty good for deep dish pizza but I have had better. I ordered a small onion and mushroom. The crust was subpar and there was very little sauce, cheese, and toppings; it was mostly dough. It does take a while to cook the pizza, like 45 minutes from when we called from the mall. Whether it takes that long when you eat in I cannot say.

<Content> If you own a jeep or SUV and want a mini off-road adventure within Champaign-Urbana, look no further than Papa Del's parking lot. Parents, be sure to watch your children very carefully when it's raining as there is no lifeguard on duty.All kidding aside, their pizza is great. I usually go over the noon hour and pick up a slice of their sausage or mushroom pizza, as a whole pizza is way too much for a singleton like me.Highly recommended if you haven't tried it.

<Content> we came shortly before noon and the tables in the front area were full. our order took too long. it was for one cheese slice and a gluten free pizza for me, not difficult. my wife got bread sticks but that was the last we heard from our server for over an hour. we asked that our pizzas be boxed up. it came a few minutes later. I thought that my wife's slice of cheese was very thick and had a lot of pizza sauce.I understand that they have just started the gf crust, I would still prefer monicals or Jupiters for gluten free.

<Content> i had heard about this place for the last couple yrs from my brother and my cowkrs who are UI alum. i had heard that the pizza is even better than some places in chicago. those are some big shoes to fill. of course, since i was coming out for my brother's graduation, and i love pizza, this was the first place i wanted to go when i arrived at champaign.for graduation wknd, this place was going to be packed, of course, so we ordered pizza for pickup on friday night. we called at 6:10 and was told that it was going to be an hour and a half...wow! we went to pick it up around 730. around that time, a huge thunderstorm came and it also started hailing. we ran into the restaurant, waited a few minutes for our pizza, grabbed it, and ran out into the pouring rain and hail to the car. on our drive back, the roads started flooding (what is this weird place???), and it took a while to get home, as many cars were stuck in the flood. we finally made it, and the pizza was delicious. we got the super stuffed w/ sausage, spinach, and mushrooms. the large was gigantic, and i only had 1 slice and was full. the pizza would have been better if we ate at the restaurant, straight out of the oven, but it was still good. we were going to re-bake it again to crisp it up, but after our wild ride back, we decided to eat it right out of the box. the best way to reheat a slice is to put it straight on a frying pan after heating it in the oven a bit.

<Content> On the rare occasions when I go back to Champaign, there are a few places I always need to revisit - the first, obviously, is Dos Reales. The second is Papa Del's. Everybody seems to love Papa Del's, and for good reason. Champaign is not exactly a hotbed of amazing cuisine, but Papa Del's delivers consistently delicious, hot, cheesy deep-dish awesomeness. There's usually a line, but even on Friday night of homecoming weekend we only waited 30 minutes! And they had us pre-order our pizza when we put our name in for a table, so by the time we sat down, we only waited about 15 minutes before the pizza arrived. The beer is dirt cheap (the one thing that makes me want to consider living in a small town), and the pizza really hits the spot. I'm not a pizza snob by any means - all I know is when I cut that first slice, and the cheese stretches out in delicious strands, and the crust is crispy....I'm a happy girl. See you next homecoming!

<Content> I visited Champaign, IL, recently for a quick weekend stay, and this restaurant was always the first suggestion made when I asked, "where should we go for lunch." It wasn't crowded at lunch time so my girlfriends and I could sit and relax. We ordered their specialty deep dish pizza. It. was. huge. We ordered a large and I think each one of the four of us at one piece. It was good but next time I will try the thin crust. If you are looking for an appetizer - try the meatballs. They were fantastic!

<Content> Papa Dels singlehandedly raised my expectations for what ridiculously good pizza should taste like. I remember when I used to think Pizza Hut was actually edible.... Thankfully I discovered Papa Dels deep-dish and have never looked back! This is no doubt the best pizza in Champaign-Urbana, and it definitely holds its own against the more famous Chicago deep-dish pizza places.

Since leaving Illinois I have made detours of many miles just for this pizza and to prove to others how good it is.. The best dinner ever and not a Chicago Style pizza, It's made with real dough, not buttery pie dough..

If it is your first time there, be aware that you won't get your pizza until about 45 minutes after you order and its not cheap. Just be prepared to inhale it when you get it.

<Content> People kept saying we needed to try Papa Del's. We went and had a medium "superstuffed" with pepperoni and sausage. It came out a few minutes early and was cooked well. However, the pizza itself was nothing special, and certainly not the best pizza I'd ever had even in Champaign (Amano's does a better deep-dish, at least). Lots of cheese, but they were light on the toppings and there was way too much empty crust.Good place to go with a group and hang out, it's pretty noisy later at night.

<Content> The best pizza in town?? This place was pretty pedestrian, and I am hoping it isn't this best in town. Our pizza was good. We got a thin crust pizza with peppers and ham or something like that. Maybe our problem was getting thin crust. I am looking forward to going back here to try the Sicilian style or Chicago style pizzas. What I am not impressed with is the limited toppings. How can people get excited about this place when they only offer about 10 toppings. I am used to more than double that.

Definitely the place to get your pizza fix.

<Content> Gross. We ordered a pizza, and were told it would be 40 minutes. Ok, no problem. At 50 minutes I asked the waitress if it was coming out soon. "5 minutes." Ok. 10 minutes went by, then another 10. We are now at an hour and 10 minutes, and still no pizza. Another 10 minutes later-- now exactly twice what we were told-- she brings out a piping hot pizza with green peppers and mushrooms. Pity that we ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza... We were so hungry that we said forget it, we'll eat this one. Then we tried to cut into it. The bottom was rock hard, and burnt to a crisp. The knives could not cut through it. And in the center of the pizza, you ask? Yep--cold as ice. WTF?!We called the waitress over, told her we'd pay for the drinks, but wanted to send the pizza back. 2 minutes later the owner is at our table, screaming at us that we are paying for the g-- d--- pizza. After attempting to calmly explain the situation, he said he didn't give a shit about that, he was getting his money. So I said, "ok, sure, no problem. You go get the check." And we left while he went to get the check.Then-- oh yes, there's more-- about 2 weeks later there is a knock at the door of my mom's house, although I no longer lived there. She phoned me and said, "Um... the police are here about a pizza you didn't pay for?" What a dick! (The waitress had known me in high school and knew my name). I told my mom not to pay, and that I'd deal with it, but of course she was just worried about me and paid it. So the asshole got his money for a pizza we didn't order or eat, and that I would not have fed to my dog. And I have never been back.

<Content> So Papa Del's is an institution, yada yada. And it really probably is the best pizza in town---if you know you're coming for a heavy, Chicago style pizza experience. The thick crust is classic Chicago style and is excellent, while the thin crust isn't really that thin but is also quite good. I usually go with their thin crust, knowing it isn't like a New York Style or anything but is instead a less bready version of their excellent deep dish offering. Their sausage topping, in particular, is always worth getting.That said, I'm not sure I recommend eating in. They are often crowded, their service can be *very* slow. Get takeout instead. Also, their parking lot looks like a giant bomb went off in it. Watch your car!

<Content> Well let me start off with- Overrated, overrated, overrated-Every time i'm in this place I wonder why I come. I feel like magically the pizza is going to get better and time and time again i'm disappointed. The place is dirty, the service is dopey...and I don't think there are enough sugar packets to keep the tables from tipping. The pizza is blah....not that i'm a huge fan of Chicago deep dish, but Giordano's, Lou Malnati's does it way better and that isn't even my favorite chicago pizza place (Pequods by the way). When you're standing there looking like a lost orphan and notice that there are several other individuals that look to be in the same state waiting, waiting, waiting....for what??? I've become much less tolerant as of late on waiting, customer service is my pet peeve and if you can't be on time with my order (within reason) then you don't deserve my business...your time is not worth more than mine. I'd prefer to go to Amanos, better pizza by far and very nice people that appreciate your business. No, I do not have any connection with the shop....I wish...but i'd prob be 50 lb heavier-

<Content> I went to grad school at UIUC in the late '70s, left for a job on the east coast in 1980, and haven't been back since. In the intervening 30 years I've eaten close to 1000 pizzas by my reckoning, all over the country but mostly in the metro NYC area -- and NYC has some pretty good pizza. But in that vast landscape of tomato pies, the only one that really stands out -- by which I mean the only one I sometimes crave with particularity; the only one I can vividly recall the appearance, aroma, and flavor of; and the only one that moves me with nostalgia -- is Papa Del's deep-dish sausage pizza. It's a typical Chicago-style pie, baked in a heavily oiled, round, black steel pan. The crust is thick, bready, and slightly sweet. It doesn't just line the bottom, but extends up the side of the pan to contain the filling like a tart shell. This makes for a very high crust-to-filling ratio. The cheese -- at least a half-pound of a mozzarella blend in a "small" pie -- goes on the bottom, to prevent the crust from becoming soggy I guess. The sausage -- another half-pound, highly seasoned with fennel and garlic -- goes on next. It's raw when they put it in the oven, so all the fat oozes out as it bakes, mixing with the crushed tomatoes that cover the pie on top to form a delicious, meaty tasting sauce. I forget whether additions like mushrooms or onions go on top of or underneath the tomatoes -- underneath I think. But one doesn't really care about the vegetables -- it's all about the cheese, the sausage, and the tomatoes. Best ... pizza ... ever! (as Comic Book Guy would say). Oh, and the lasagna dinner (with meat sauce) isn't bad either, if you're not in the mood for pizza.

<Content> I went there with my family after the High School state championship games. After waiting to be seated we ordered our pizzas because the waitress advised that they take a while. About a half-hour later she brings the first of the two we ordered. She then tells us I have some bad news that may be good news. She tells us she gave our second pizza to the wrong table however if we still want it the other table only ate a couple of pieces and we can have it for 50% off!I thought she was kidding but she was completely serious. I told her that was pretty gross and that we wanted a fresh pizza. She puts the order in and 45 minutes later the pizza still wasn't at our table although most of the people eating had left. Finally it came 50 minutes after she reordered. I asked to speak to the manager. The waitress came back and said the manager was busy and would only come out if we really wanted to talk to him but he would give us a discount.I told her I wanted to talk to him. A few minutes later a kid comes out of the kitchen wearing gloves and holding a spatula. I told him what happened and how long we waited and he said sorry. That was it. I told him about our waitress offering a partially eaten pizza and he said he talked to her about that. I am pretty sure she got someone from the kitchen to come out and not the manager. Long story short they took $5 off after we spent 2 hours in the restaurant. I will never go backObservations:The restaurant is dirty and needs a good cleaning The whole restaurant is dated and the finishes are worn out. The wait staff is clueless, obviously because nobody manages them.The only reason the restaurant is still going is because there is no real competition.Trust me go somewhere else where they want your business and maybe they clean once in a while..

<Content> Amazing. Delicious. I eat way too much of it! They have Shiner Bock on tap, which is another plus. Yes, it's a wait, so go with a group of friends and order some pitchers while you wait. Or get take-out or delivery if you don't have time to be social. But don't miss the goodness.

<Content> Having not eaten at Papa Del's since around 1975, I can't judge the current food and service. But I can tell you that 35 years ago the pizza then was the best and the service the worst. So I guess some things never change. . . .

<Content> Their pan pizza is very good, nothing special though. I guess I may be spoiled form Lou Malnati.

<Content> Finished a wonderful day with Dublin O'Neil's Bread and Butter Pudding. Amazing! I've never had bread pudding this good. Irish bar, not driving, had to have an Irish coffee. Asked about one and they offered to create one with Jameson... it was brought to the table warm. I asked them to heat... waiter said he would bring me another. This one was much more temperature coffee should be...Love the look of the bar, brick wall, small tables for hearing conversations, moderate volume on music... but every time door opened a blast of cold air hit you. Next time need a table toward the back.

<Content> This place used to be amazing. Now... It's okay.When we first started coming here, we loved the fact that they had good, reasonably priced food and a good selection of beer that was also reasonably priced. The fish and chips were really great and could easily feed two people. The boxty pancakes were high quality and decently sized. In general, everything was very good.In the past few months, however, there have been some changes. Serving sizes are smaller. Prices are higher all around. And the quality of the food just isn't up to par with what it once was. It's pretty disappointing.A year ago, I would have and did recommend this spot to pretty much everyone. Now? It's just another overpriced downtown bar.

<Content> The beer selection here is really good, and I liked that you had a choice of 3 sizes to allow for tasting a variety of beers. If you love Shepherds Pie, do not get it here unless you want a very nontraditional version. I have had this dish in the UK, New Zealand, NY, and many other Irish pubs around the country, but none were at all like this dish. While the flavor of the the sauce was good, the contents were soupy (you could only eat it with a spoon), the onions were not fully cooked so were crunchy, and the lamb was very strong tasting and in chunks rather than the traditional minced meat. I won't be ordering it again. My dinner companions did seem to enjoy the chicken pot pie and the fish and chips, though.

<Content> I hate to disagree with everyone, but I am NOT impressed with the food at Dublins. I have eaten there 3 times and have been disappointed each time. I will not be back. The Shepard's Pie is not good at all. I don't like eating lamb and even beyond that it was not impressive. Maggie Miley's in nearby Normal has a Shepard's Pie to die for. The Irish Nachos are basically pub chips (saturated in grease) with very limited toppings. I've had better believe me. My buddy and I didn't even eat half of them. I bascially took them home and threw them out in the backyard for the crows to pick at. The Ruben was equally disappointing, greasy, small portion, and just plain not good. I'm not that picky of an eater trust me, but the food here is just not good. Great bartenders and good beer selections though. Come full....

<Content> I love this place. Before I had complaints about the food being a little bland, but I have noticed a big change this past year. Salt! I almost always get the Irish nachos, and the whiskey sour is to die for. They use egg whites in it, so it's nice a smooth. We love this place!

<Content> Dublin O'Neil's is one of those places with outstanding ambience and excellent food. The Irish Nachos are incredible. The seafood chowder may be the best chowder I've had anywhere. The macaroni and cheese is absolutely excellent with solid overtones of smoked Gouda. The only thing that made me grade them down is a lack of a kids menu. (Not difficult to add if they'd just do it.)The draught beer selection is also excellent. I'm a huge fan!

<Content> They just redid their menu which is good because I was quickly bored with the options here. Their food is a lot more reasonably priced than similar restaurants in the area and the quality is pretty good but sometimes their menu can seem limited. Certain dishes are better than others and even ones that sound interesting can turn out to be rather bland. They also frequently repeat specials so there's rarely something that I haven't tried.The bloody mary's we had yesterday were pretty great! and well seasoned. Could be more creative with the garnish though.On another note, the service can be hit or miss. Yesterday we experienced wonderful service but just last January four of us had to seat ourselves after standing in the front of the restaurant and being ignored for 20 minutes and then sitting down and being ignored for another 20 minutes until we even got to see menus.

<Content> Two stars might be generous for me, but I'm trying to be nice. Despite the fact that there was only one other table seated, service was painfully slow and apparently, if you're a party of two, you can only have a tall table along the wall. The decor/style is okay for a "pub," but that's where the pub atmosphere ends. It's just another pretentious eatery downtown in a varied genre. No music. Limited drink availability to what they perceive as "authentic," and the first two I tried to order they didn't have the ingredients for. A disappointing start, for sure. The menu is largely English traditional (bangers, Americanized shepherd's pie, etc)We started with the "Irish" nachos because it made me giggle and I like corned beef. Most of the "meat" was just wads of fat and they were so greasy that it dripped off the chips as you picked them up. The couple of dry chips we found weren't too bad.I got the fish and chips which, literally, developed a pool of grease in the bottom of the basket. You have to request salt/pepper/ketchup since the tables the so tiny, I guess. I finished one of three small fillets before I just couldn't do it. My companion enjoyed the flavor of the shank, but it was a little cool in temperature.The entrees are fairly pricey ($13-$20+) from what I recall, and completely not worth it. I won't go back.

<Content> There's only one thing that really needs to be said: Smoked Gouda Mac & Cheese. Be still my heart. I am so happy they made it an option for an entree. I ordered it with rashers; my sister with bangers. Both were very, very tasty. Everyone at the table enjoyed their food. Service wasn't slow. And dessert has never disappointed.

<Content> We had late lunch on a Saturday and the place was fairly empty. Nice small place with a few tables outside. Food was tasty, our server was awesome, funny and friendly. I had veg pot pie, which was good, tasted very homemade. My husband had a meatball sandwich and a scotch egg. Not the best scotch egg he's ever had (Broad Ripple Brew Pub, Indiana) but the sandwich was ok. Fun place, but kind of pricey for a casual lunch.

<Content> We came here for NYE '13 dinner. About halfway through our dinner, a country/folk? band started performing extremely depressing songs. not my idea of new years cheer. The food was awesome! I loved every bite of it! Our waitress asked us to order the specials since they were competing to sell the most. I thought that was unprofessional and uncomfortable. All four of us ended up getting a special, but not because she had requested it.The ribs were to die for. the meat was tender and the truffles/ mushrooms were cooked well. I don't know if this special will be offered again, but if it is, i highly recommend it.Minus a star because they won't make an irish coffee. My bf ordered one and they would only serve him one of their fancy drinks. how hard is it to put whisky into coffee at a restaurant with a bar?

<Content> Seems weird to give 5 stars to a new place in a slightly cardboard building, BUT the category is 'as good as it gets' and I always rate that according to the city in which I am....Firstly - to those who criticize it for not being 'irish' enough - get over yourselves. We're not in Dublin unfortunately, which means Champaign doesn't have access to the resources and ingredients that Dublin restaurants do.Ambience: Fun, noisy enough to get away with the occasional swear word.Service: Friendly, unobtrusive, quick.Drinks: AwesomeFood: Surprisingly good - more gastro-pub than PUB fare...excellent options for carnivores, pescatarians and veges alike.Highly recommend.

<Content> I went back last night for some late night food and drinks after a movie, and need to update this a bit. The food and drinks are great. Seafood Chowder and potato pancakes with smoked salmon are amazing. I am addicted to their steamed mussels. The food is still excellent. Enjoyed some Two Brothers on tap, Baily's and Coffee for my buddy, and they had an Irish like folk band playing that was really good.The service was horrific. There might have been two other full tables besides us, along with just two or three people at the bar. The place was not packed at all. It was damn near impossible to get served. The waitress would not even look at us most the night. I don't know what happened? During a nearly full lunch hour, the service was spot on before. We could not even get our bill after asking several times. Really, you guys don't want to get money for the meal and drinks? OK, fine with me. We ended up just putting some cash on the table and left. I am thinking of taking off another star. Though the food, vibe, and drinks was still excellent.

<Content> I was torn between 2 and 3 stars.  I tried this place for the first time last weekend due to some friends who wanted to drink here. There is really two stories when it comes to my experience.The food- This is where I would give this place 2 or maybe even 1 star. I love shepherds pie and it was of course on the menu, so I ordered it. It was a somewhat decent portion and looked good. However, the goodness ended there. When I laid my fork into it I discovered that this was not a shepherds pie. What I was served was a liquid soup like substance. I couldn't even eat it with a fork so I had to request a spoon, which was an adventure. I had to wait 10 minutes before I could get someones attention to bring me a spoon. The drinks- They have a decent beer selection, but I wouldn't go back for that. What I would go back is for their mixed drinks. They have a nice drink selection and do a great job making them. They take their time and make them right with some semi-advanced techniques. Although the bartenders sucked as waiters/waitresses (see spoon story above), they were great bartenders. I would easily give this place 4 or 5 stars when it comes to drinks.Will I come back? Maybe, but I will not order food here again. It is a shame since this is the only Irish Pub in Champaign/Urbana. No, Murphy's does not count as an Irish Pub or anything. Using a green shamrock and an Irish name doesn't make a bar an Irish Pub.

<Content> Went there for the first time last night. Took 10 minutes to get my beer, but the wife got her soda right away. Waiter brought the wrong appetizer. Advised him of this after about 5 minutes (because he never came back). He realized he gave us another table's appetizer. He took the appetizer off our table and gave it to the right table (I could not believe he did that). Then our food came out before our appetizer. It was very loud and service was not good. Food was average. Not a big menu, a little pricy, and small space. Was the first and last time we go there. Nothing special.

<Content> LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I'm a bit of a sucker for Irish fare in general, but the atmosphere here takes it a step further. Small and intimate with dark woods and nice artistic accents. I've had just about everything on the menu and the only thing I was unimpressed with was the roasted chicken. Definitely try the fisherman's stew! It's sooo goooood. The corned beef and cabbage is amazing, the shepherd's pie is so savory and the bangers and mash are just wonderful. They do a great snakebite too (which down in Chambana is Guinness and cider, not Guinness and Harp)

<Content> My wife and I tried this place for the first time tonight.I want to start by saying our waitress was excellent! She provided great service and was very attentive. The kitchen on the other hand, was really, really slow.We ordered beer battered bangers for an appetizer. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the serving was generous.For our entrees my wife ordered salmon that came with Gouda macaroni and asparagus. I ordered fish and chips. We waited almost an hour for our entrees to be served.When our food arrived it was quite tasty (or maybe I was just starving by then) and the portions were plentiful. The Gouda macaroni and cheese was very good.Besides the food preparation being really slow it was way too loud! The place isn't that big. When it's packed with people all trying to talk at the same time it's loud. Even with the sound level uncomfortably high, management still feels its necessary to crank the sound system up to a level making it impossible to hold a conversation.The food is good, but the environment makes it impossible to enjoy your meal!

<Content> I don't know anything about how authentically Irish the food, decor, or general ambiance is. What I do know is that ALL of the meat in this restaurant is sourced locally, and is pastured - in the case of the beef, it's 100% grass-fed. As someone who will ONLY eat local pastured meats, and therefore is limited to vegetarian or pescetarian choices in restaurants, this is an AMAZING gift! To be in a restaurant that goes out of its way to use these kinds of meats is phenomenal. To all those who complain about the prices - I guarantee you they are VERY reasonable for this kind of meat! ...and worth every penny, as far as I'm concerned. They also use these great paper to-go boxes instead of styrofoam. I'm thrilled to support any business that goes that much out of its way to support the environment and other local businesses and small agriculture.As far as the good goes, what we had was awesome. A couple of Irish coffees (one traditional, one Baileys) to get us warm after coming in from the cold weather, an appetizer of Irish nachos, and entrees were fish-n-chips and shepherd's pie... after the food was so fabulous, we had to try the desserts, even though it meant taking a lot of it home in the aforementioned boxes. The flourless chocolate cake was good, and the bread pudding was amazing.We went mid-afternoon, so I can't speak to the crowds, since there weren't any. The waitress was awesome. The food was slow, as someone else mentioned, but we were warned ahead of time that it was all made fresh-to-order, so we were already prepared for that.All-in-all, I highly recommend it, and we'll definitely be going back!

My friend got the Pub burger. It looked amazing. He raved about it. Not sure if they take reservations. If you go in the evening, it'd be helpful to call ahead. My friends tried to go for dinner recently and they said it was shoulder to shoulder packed. Looking forward to going again and trying more dishes.

<Content> Poor service and bad food. Never a good combination.We ordered 2 beers, and the waitress did not know anything about them. Would have been nice to get a warning they were hoppier than that type of beer usually is.BF ordered the seafood chowder which turned out to be the best item. He also got the seafood stew which was WAY oversalted, like, no one tasted it going out. Stew portion was tiny compared to other stews I've had elsewhere in the country (like 2 mussels, 2 clams, 2 shrimp). Also, the broth was thickened tomato based, which is fine I guess, but I prefer thin tomato based broth.I had the bangers and mash. The potatoes were supposed to be kale mashed, but I only found one, small piece of kale. They potatoes were cold to lukewarm at best. Clearly sitting in a pot while the sausages were cooked. They were hot, at least, but a little mushy. Gravy was ok.We told our server our issues and she said, oh. Sorry.Oh, sorry, we won't be back.

The level of professionalism displayed by these two was impeccable.  I even learned that Megan was coming in at 10am... Are you kidding me close to open and so hospitable? You have a star. Honestly, I didn't even look around to see the decor because I was so amazed by the service. Six years absent from chambana and this was an experience to make me regret graduating.

The bartenders are very knowledge on the different beers, of which there are many, and helpful. The menu has a lot of very good looking choices. We had the mussels, smoked gouda mac and cheese, shepherds pie, and braised beef ribs. It was all good, the mac and cheese was awesome, and the shepherds pie was great. The short ribs were tasty and tender, and my only complaint is that it wasn't hot enough for my taste. Overall I would recommend this place for a lot of different types of nights out.

<Content> I have a mixed opinion on this place. I've been there a couple of times for lunch, but never dinner. I find the place reasonably priced, and the meal portions quite large (aka, that's a good thing.) I've had a chicken pot pie, and some other chicken meal. It was like a grilled chicken sandwich. Both were very large portions, and are heavier feeling going down.  This is rich, savory food. Anyway, my chicken pot pie was good, though took long to come out. About 40 minutes and it wasn't too busy. My chicken breast sandwich came out sooner, but I had to send it back because it was not done in the middle. Fortunately it came back better, and I avoided any possible food sickness. Service was always friendly, but not always fast. Waits were on the longer side, even on non busy days. I also had a friend that did get food sickness from some seafood dish from one of the two times I went. All and all, not my type of place, but what I experienced was not bad. I hear the bar/pub scene of this place is of more appeal than the food, but I only have gone for the food.

<Content> Mixed feelings about this place! To be honest the food is a five but the service and atmosphere was a 2, at best. It was a slow night so our waitress decided to leave after taking our order, leaving us in the care of the bartender. She gave us one refill and visited with a really obnoxious, intoxicated girl at the bar about tattoos for the rest of our visit. The intoxicated friend smacked the glasses off the head of the man accompanying her, and called other people at the bar swear words (repeatedly). It started out borderline entertaining but she ended up being the most annoying person we've encountered while eating. After a shot, we thought she was gonna fall down...somehow she didn't....Again, the food, no complaints! The Gouda Mac n cheese was amazing and the chicken pot pie was perfect. I'd think someone would want to take care of the other issues before the food isn't enough to bring people in!

<Content> I'll qualify this review by saying that 1) I've only been here once and 2) I got the burger (I'm on a quest to find the best burgers C-U has to offer). The place is nice looking, if a bit small, and the staff was friendly enough. The beer and cider selection is okay, even if they hit you over the head with Guinness all the time. I was expecting an Irish pub, and the place is more upscale than that. The burgers were okay, if a bit dry, but the cheese and bacon on them was overpowering. It wasn't my favorite food in the world, and I've been in better pubs in other places. That said, I didn't go in to try the entrees, and so your experiences may vary.

<Content> We have always had great service at Dublin O'Neil's but the more recent changes and fake pub atmosphere finally got to us. They are now trying too hard to compete on too high a level with surrounding restaurants. This was our favorite late evening/late night place to grab a casual meal downtown but the menu now features very non-pub food prices and the portions have suffered along with the price creep. I had two bad food related experiences but kept going back because when everything was good it was a great value, but the last meal was simply underwhelming and terribly overpriced. I contacted management twice, once regarding a serious spoiled seafood issue, and never received a response. No thanks. Not when there is better choice next door.

<Content> Cute, small Irish pub without the pub comfort but with some gastro-pub aspirations. The best thing about Dublin O'Neil's is the shepherd's pie, made with lamb. It's not just good, it's extraordinary. Really. Very. Amazing.Also very good are the seafood chowder (cream-based) and the soda bread. We usually also get their curried sweet potato chips (served with a side of sour cream) as an appetizer and have enjoyed their fish and chips (light batter, beautifully cooked fish). My boy enjoys their burger.My husband loves the fresh Guinness on tap. The decor is Irish contemporary. The music is often Irish, too, for which we're grateful, being fans of the genre.Other reviewers who say the place is small, the noise level can be loud, and the staff can be slow are all on point. It's better to go when the place isn't packed.Website: dublinoneils.com

<Content> I've been here a few times, and the first time I was pretty happy. They weren't very busy, and we were in and out quickly. However, the next 2 times were just awful. The second time I went the waiter knew about TWO of the beers on the menu. If you're going to carry an extensive beer list, especially with specialty beers that people may be unfamiliar with, PLEASE have a knowledgeable staff. My fish and chips were soggy and I was generally disappointed. Because my first experience was good, I decided they might have had an off day. I gave them another shot, and after an EXTREMELY long wait for both our table and our food, I ended up with a lovely case of food poisoning. From reading other reviews, this isn't an uncommon occurrence. This place had great potential, but poor service and food safety killed it for me.

<Content> This place probably has the best vibe in Champaign for restaurants. Very modern interior and professional waitstaff. I've been here several times while I was out here in Champaign and none disappointed. The ramen is good, sushi is much better than any others in Champaign, and appetizers are delicious! This place will definitely be successful. It's on the higher end in terms of pricing compared to everything else on the street, but you need to treat yourself every now and then. It's on the further end of Green St, but worth the trek.Be sure to try their sushi and ramen out! Their specials have always been delicious!

<Content> Great atmosphere. Right on university campus but without too many students. The Sushi, Rolls and Ramen are great. I drank Korean rice wine and sparkling peach sake, both were delicious. The restaurant has a Korean twist on Japanese udon, making it spicy. Personally not a favorite. But I will go again for sushi, ramen and drinks.

<Content> The Sushi is very GOOD!I came with my girlfriend on a Friday night for dinner. We got there at 7 and had to wait around 20ish minutes to get a table but they had a seating system where they text you when they're ready for you so it wasn't a big deal. The Atmosphere:The restaurant itself is beautiful, modern and minimalist. It is a bit small but I personally enjoy that vibe at a sushi restaurant; it usually means that the kitchen can take the time needed to make the food for you. The Food/Drink:I was not very thrilled with the drink menu. I really wanted some nigori sake but it was $45 for a bottle, a bit much. We ended up getting a bottle of makgeolli and some beers. As for the food we got steamed gyozas (had to ask for them to be steamed because they are on the menu as fried) and 4 different sushi rolls: shrimp tempura, Philadelphia, Sakanaya, and the Windy City. We were satisfied with the gyozas and all of the rolls but especially enjoyed the sakanaya and windy city rolls, definitely a repeat order item. The fish was fresh and the rolls looked extremely appetizing the way that they were presented. The service: This is the only part of the restaurant I wasn't thrilled about. Our waitress was a bit cold and seemed like she was going out of her way every time we asked something. She could have been having a bad night so I don't think it would be fair to say the restaurant as a whole has bad service.Takeaway:All in all I will definitely make Sakanaya my go to sushi destination in Champaign/Urbana.

<Content> This place is the most unassuming little building on Green Street, so it took my roommate and me a while to try it. But man are we glad we did.The place has a really relaxed lounge-like atmosphere, and a very modern feel. There aren't a lot of tables, so there's usually a wait during dinner hours, but they take your cell phone number and text you when your table is ready. So you're free to wander around a bit if you want while you wait.The menu is admittedly a bit pricey, but the portions are generous and filling. The first time I was here, I got the bul-goki, which came with a mountain of delicious marinated beef, a salad, and a few pieces of sushi. I can eat a lot, and I still couldn't quite finish!If you have some spare cash to burn and are looking for a delicious and flavorful dinner, this is a place that should be high on your list.

<Content> Holy crap. When I came to visit my baby brother in college (where the heck is Urbana-Champaign, anyways??), I thought that I would be eating the run-of-the-mill college food. Mentally prepared for dry burgers and overcooked pasta, I was nearly weeping with joy when I saw that there was a good sushi place.Sakanaya did not disappoint. My brother and I had the Playgirl and the normal spicy tuna and salmon avocado rolls. The Playgirl was DELICIOUS (how do you fit that much crunchy flavor into one bite?). The spicy tuna also came in chunks rolling in spicy sauce, none of that nasty mayo stuff. It was so good we practically inhaled it.It is a small restaurant, so if you come during a prime time there will be a short wait. It was around 20 minutes for us at 6:30 PM on a Sunday, so not enough to deter me next time.Now that we discovered Sakanaya, I may be a leeetttle more inclined to come visit UIUC again. Mmmmmm.

<Content> This restaurant impressed me with its attention to detail. Right from the get go- you have the laminate wood exterior, and the zen feel is all throughout the interior. The posh, slate colored trim and the dim oversized lightbulbs gives it an industrial flavor. You see the detail work in the silverware, menu, even the napkins... the ambiance outranks all of the other campus restaurants out there. This meticulous attention is of course given to the food. I'm a bit picky about my sushi and I can say that the sushi here is fantastic. I've had their cold noodles and ramen as well. Like the sushi, they all have a balanced composition of flavor and texture. Its definitely worth going to for a nice dinner out on campus.

<Content> Giving it 4 stars because I wish the space was bigger, but other than that everything was amazing! I'm from Chicago suburbs, so kinda picky when it comes to sushi, but sakanaya is, I think, the best in champaign! The sushi is served at room temperature which is amazing! I especially love their sashimi. It's a little pricy, so definitely don't come here all the time, but I'm so glad they opened this place up!

<Content> Had the late night menu here a couple weeks ago. The sushi itself was good, though the portions of tuna in the nigiri seemed less generous than comparable places in town like Yellowfin or Kamakura. The service was a little bit slow, and seating is limited: there was a 20 minute wait or so to get a table, even though it was past 10PM. The sake was cheap and plentiful enough to make the wait less of a big deal. We finished off our meal with the deep-fried chicken wings from their late-night menu. Quite good! To sneak in one final nitpick, though: the place tries very hard to make itself seem like a big-city sushi joint with its ambiance, and by that I mean music was blaring pretty loud through the speakers during our meal, making it hard to carry on quiet conversation.

<Content> I visited U of I recently and was looking for a place to eat on green st. since it was within walking distance from my friend's apartment. 4 stars for this place and something I hadn't been to before, sounds good to me. I was a little hesitant though since there were no elite reviews and some of the reviews seem like fakes, but here's mine. Hopefully you can trust me.I walked in and it looks really nice, nice decorations and everything, just really small. Put our name in and waited probably 20 minutes or so to be seated. People love their sushi on a Saturday night I guess. I recommend calling for a reservation, and don't plan on coming if you have more that 4 people since there's barely enough tables as is. From what I read, the ramen was pretty good. My friend told me that too and the waiter said that's what they were known for so that sounded good to me. The gf and I both got ramen, forgot what their names were though. We did have different broths though and I liked mine better. Hers was the first one listed and mine was the second. I'm definitely a fan of this. I usually don't like ramen since you can pay 10 cents and make it in the microwave as opposed to paying 13 bucks for this one, but this was good. Meat was even tender and the dish as a whole was pretty solid.We also ordered a sakanaya roll which was recommended by our waiter. Guess the sushi was backed up since it took a while for it to get out to us. To be honest I wasn't really a fan. Tasted fine but wasn't anything special. It was room temperature, so it just makes me think that it was sitting out for a while, but hey that may be your cup of tea, who knows. But anyway, 4 stars for the ramen dishes pretty much.

<Content> Ahhh, I miss the Sakanaya roll. Barely any of the sushi places on campus offer scallop, so I immediately ordered it. It's awesome! Seared scallop with bonito flakes tops the roll and it has salmon, crab meat, and avocado (okay, so a really glorified Cali roll), but it's very tasty and presented gorgeously. It's around $14, so be ready to part with your cash! The treat is definitely worth it though.The ramen is delicious, albeit pricey. Huge portions of everything are in your ramen. My only complaint is that some of my ramen noodles had a strange. mild soapy taste. The pork broth had a strong, savory flavor, and I recommend getting the tonkotsu ramen. The slices of pork and veggies are also generous, which I really liked. It's not the best ramen I've ever had, so I don't think the price is warranted. The interior is very small and a bit cramped when it's full of people coming in and out, so be ready to be bumped a bit or squeeze by people at dinner. However, the staff are polite and do their best to stay organized; they use an iPad system to keep track of orders and tables, and they wait in the back or to the side while on standby to avoid collisions. I think it's considerate because the wait might take a while (even with a reservation), so you can walk around on Green Street and they'll call you when a table opens up.So far it's the only place on campus that has good ramen, so I suppose I could say I'm a fan.

<Content> This is by far the best sushi place in Champaign. It explains why there's usually a line outside the door of this classy establishment. Keep in mind that Japanese restaurants tend to sacrifice quantity for quality and at Sakanaya, you are definitely paying for high quality food. The lunch and dinner menus are different and note that the lunch menu has lunch specials if you're looking to save some money. I hope they release their menu online sometime in the future.

<Content> We thought the food was wonderful. Hot, spicy flavorful Ramen. HOWEVER, the egg wa totally overcooked which seemed like such a shame. The water jars with the definition of water on the side of the bottle gave us a little chuckle so I will still give this place four stars, mainly because the food was basically amazing. The egg though. Shameful.

<Content> SO and I are looking for a go to sushi place in this barren wasteland called Chambana. And boy did we find one.The Good:-The Sakanaya roll was salmon, crab salad, avocado on the inside and it was topped with torched scallops and fish flakes. It was extremely good, the fish flakes brought an interesting twist to it, great texture,-Blue-fin tuna sashimi. Our waiter recommended the current special, which was priced at 2.5 per piece. Neither my SO or I particularly like sashimi, but we both loved it, it was fantastic.-The miso soup was just the right amount saltiness and fantastic flavor.-We also got the Una-Q roll and the Salmon roll, and both were well really well wrapped and delicious. The eel in the Una-Q roll melts in your mouth.-The ambiance! It's exactly what we were looking for, upscale but still casual. Fantastic.-The service is also fantastic! Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable. The Bad:NOTHING!Overall:Absolutely fantastic. We will be back again soon, I guarantee it.

<Content> As a huge fan of sushi and sashimi, i thought this place was okaythe ambience is 10/10 and the drinks are amazing.i was not impressed by the $20 ramen that was yes, full of other things, BUT the noodles still tasted like the packaged ones :(if it was $10 i would not be complaining, but they ask far too much money for the lack of taste (ok so i guess its fine if you dont know anything about food)the sashimi was cut into very short pieces, making me feel like i was getting half of what i paid for. the flying fish roe was perfect though.yeah they have cute water bottle and stuff, but i feel like this places sells the look more than the food. if they worked harder on their flavour, i would be a huge fan.unfortunately i'm the kind of girl who wants to see what you can do rather than how you look, so 3 stars for me(dont get me wrong, i understand the cost of decorating and operating a business this nice. it's cute and it comes out of your wallet. i just go out for food, not to stare at walls)

<Content> This place was very delicious and overall a great experience. They have very exotic and traditional food! I got sushi and my dad got a sea urchin!! What's really awesome is that all of their fish is wild-caught and not farm raised!!! The place is tiny but very beautiful, clean, inviting and the staff is very nice! We were in and out within an hour, but keep in mind we did get there right when it opened so it wasn't very busy. I've heard that when it's busy you'll be waiting a loooong time. Overall a pretty awesome place!

<Content> I ate here a few weeks ago by myself on a Friday night. Yes, I am that guy who doesn't mind going out to eat by myself. The staff and atmosphere were great and the sushi was amazingly fresh.I ordered the dumplings, a couple pieces of shushimi (salmon and blue fin tuna) and a roll. I also ordered the most amazing sake. The sake was chilled in ice and had cucumber added to it. It tasted like cucumber water and was so smooth, which is dangerous since it contains 19% alcohol. I liked everything so much that I ordered another round of everything excluding the dumplings. My final bill came out to $80, but it was well worth it. I can't wait to be back in town to try another round.

<Content> Oh wow, an actual ramen place on campus. Who would have thought? People complaining about the price of ramen obviously have not had their share of ramen to know pricing. It's about what you'll pay at any restaurant, except maybe street vendors or whatnot. Anyways, the ramen is decent, not amazing. It's probably the best you'll find on campus. What makes the ramen? The broth. Being the snob I am, I asked for a little bit of each ramen's broth but was told that they make the broth with each bowl of ramen. Hmm. Some flags when up there. Regardless, I tried both the soy based and chicken based broths and found there was really nothing special about either of them. Again, if you're looking for ramen this place is the best bet, but don't expect anything spectacular.The sushi was what I was more impressed with, as every single place on campus was disappointing me (apart from Cheese and Crackers who imports their fish overnight) but the fish was surprisingly fresh and they gave me considerable chunks of fish for my nigiri. Delicious white tuna by the way.I'd definitely go back for the sushi. If they ever change the ramen or I'm super desperate for some at 2:00 AM or something I'll give this place another try.*Also there were little things I really liked about the place like the atmosphere, the little pipettes they use for soy sauce, and especially the fact that they give you an entire jug of water for your table.

<Content> I've been sitting on this review for a while, mulling it over. My husband and I went here a month or so ago right at opening time. By the time we were seated, there were already people waiting to get in. Seems like people were as excited by Sakanaya as we were. Aside from the pop-up ramen nights that happen from time to time, there hasn't been a place in town to get real ramen. I'm sad to say that I'm still waiting for a good ramen place.The ambiance in Sakanaya is really really impressive, especially remembering what Sushi Avenue (the restaurant formerly in this location) used to look like. Very nice date-night atmosphere with low lights and a beautiful interior. However, that kind of thing factors in pretty low on my set of priorities. My husband and I both ordered a bowl of ramen. They're pretty huge, easily a meal by itself or more than that if you haven't got a big appetite. However, at $12-$13 it was overpriced. The noodles were sticking to each other (like they'd been sitting around for a while cooling), and the broth had no depth of flavor. At first bite the broth's flavor was quite good, but as I got closer to the end of the bowl I realized how completely unremarkable it was. The pork slices were good, but not great, and the hardboiled egg was nothing special, either. Additionally, I found the inclusion of corn baffling and off-putting. I would pay maybe $8 or $9 for this ramen. At Mitsuwa up near Chicago, $10 buys a pretty remarkable bowl of ramen from the Santouka shop, and that is my frame of reference for this meal.We also got a couple pieces of sushi with our meal which were about on-par with our other favorite places in town, Sushi Kame and Yellowfin. In short, the sushi is good but a bit more expensive than other places in town, and the ramen would be serviceable if it cost about $4 less. I think you will like this place if you don't mind paying a bit more for a fancy atmosphere, but I probably won't be back.

The decor is really nice, the service is top notch and most importantly - the fish / sushi itself is really great quality. We had some miso soup, hot sake, a couple of specialty sushi rolls (Sakanaya and OMG), a classic spicy tuna and shrimp tempura. Everything was delicious, fresh and well presented. This is certainly the best sushi place in town!

<Content> Came here for dinner on a Friday evening. It's a little small, so prepare to wait at prime dining hours. We had the sakanaya and kamikaze rolls and fatty salmon to share. The sakanaya roll was particularly good- crab, avocado, and salmon, topped with scallop and fish flakes. Really, really good. One of the better sushi rolls I've had at any sushi place. Both rolls were nicely presented. Fatty salmon is my weakness, and Sakanaya's is very expensive per piece ($9!) but it was pretty worth it tonight. While it wasn't the best piece I've ever had, it was still melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you ever get the chance, you need to try fatty salmon! For the rest of our meal, we had tonkatsu ramen. I have to say, I wasn't blown away by the ramen. I'd give it three stars. The broth was the right color and consistency, but it really lacked the richness and pork flavor that tonkatsu ramen should have. It just tasted a little thin and bland. Definitely need to work on that. The noodles themselves were nice and chewy, so no complaints about that. Meat was tasty, but cut pretty thin. Thumbs down for the egg, which was hard boiled and cold... Skimpy on the bamboo shoots. I was happy about the noodles, but the rest of the ramen was just okay. Overall, I'd give Sakanaya 3.5 stars. The sushi is great but I think the ramen could be improved a lot. I'd love to explore the rest of the menu some time. I'll definitely be back, at least for sushi!

<Content> Definitely make sure to show up early. The tables filled up quick when they opened up for dinner hours at 5pm.I ordered the Bulgoki and my friend ordered the Miso Ramen. The Bulgoki was visually pleasing. I had never gotten Bulgoki with a side salad, two sushi pieces, and two pieces of crispy tofu. I felt like it was worth the price for what I got. I've spent about $12 for Bulgogi at other restaurants, but it was only the meat and rice. So Sakanaya gave a nice addition. I also thought it was a good way to still put a little Japanese influence in the dish. For the Miso Ramen, it was tasty. It was a big bowl of Ramen definitely not something you can find elsewhere on Green St. The pork was very tender and the broth just made it taste better.Overall, it was a good food night. I definitely recommend Sakanaya if you want a nice place to go for dinner. The food's taste matches the decor: awesome.

Her 6 dollar California roll actually tasted a lot better than mine. The atmosphere's nice. I love the decoration and design. I'll probably come back to try a different roll. So far I still think the lunch eel roll is the best. I guess I'll stick to lunch now

<Content> Just dined here with my husband and our friend, and everything was top to bottom delicious. Certainly it seems like there's a vocal minority at work here. No bother, here is what you need to know: The miso ramen was simply perfect. Everything about it, the balance of flavor, the portion size, the doneness of the noodles --perfect. I had a tempura shrimp roll, and it was 7 pieces deep, all big and overflowing with everything you'd want in a roll. But let's talk about the fact that the ownership actually put some care and attention to the details about the way this place looks. Fact is, humans are very much moved by their environment, and Sakanaya designed this place to be an experience. I will gladly pay the prices on the menu to eat this type of fare in a really beautiful space. All others can hit up Panda Express. Enjoy. Nice work, Sakanaya. Really impressive. We'll be back, time and time again.

<Content> FINALLY. I've been waiting for Urbana-Champaign to open up a Japanese ramen shop and one has finally opened. With an extensive menu of appetizers, fresh sashimi, sushi rolls, shoyu + miso ramen, and other korean dishes, you will definitely have to take some time to look over the menu. I would have to say that the sushi was the freshest I've ever tasted in Urbana-Champaign. Being from Florida, my standards for sushi are a bit high and have been disappointed over the past 2.5 years I have been living in the CU, but Sakanaya does not disappoint. Location is ideal as it is right on Green Street, the heart of the UofI campus. Parking can be hectic though. ($0.75/hr) Parking is free after 9pm and free on Sundays. There was a line the entire time we were there, but service was fast and friendly, so the line was constantly moving. Also, we went after opening day. The interior and exterior is very appealing, but the inside is a bit smaller than I would have imagined. The tables are pretty close to each other. The man next to our table was sitting alone, listening on our conversation and occasionally talked to us. Prices are a bit more expensive than I thought. Since it is catering to mostly college students, thinking of one's budget, the ramen bowl would've been nice at $8, instead of the $12. Portion size is good - shared a shoyu ramen bowl and kamakazi (sushi roll) with a friend and we were satisfied. (But there was still room left for dessert.) Ramen broths are pork-based. The pork melts in your mouth and the broth isn't too salty or bland - just right. It was a bit lukewarm though, but that's just preference. I like my soups really hot. The salmon on the kamakazi was really soft and melted in your mouth too. Definitely fresh. Tl;dr? - Sushi and ramen are good. Get it. - Atmosphere is romantic. Definitely a date night kind-of place. - Worth the experience/trip, not worth the price. Would've been better if it was $4 cheaper. Where else can you buy authentic Japanese ramen here, anyway?

<Content> A good sushi restaurant in Central Illinois? Yeah, I had my doubts too. But Sakanaya is here to make you a believer. This coming from a Southern CA native. The fish was fresh and the rolls were inventive. Looking forward to trying the ramen next time!

<Content> I totally have a soft spot for this place. Small, yes. But delicious and worth the wait. Love the ramen and seaweed salad. Hot sake is huge for $6. Nick the manager is totally awesome and super attentive to customers. Service is always with a smile. Fish quality in sushi is fresh and better than most places here. My only complaint is the portion size with the sake don. For $17, expecting more fish. This is basically appetizer size in Seattle. Wish they were open for lunch too.

<Content> I went here with a meetup group last night. We ordered chips and guacamole and chips and salsa as appetizers. Good stuff! Then, we all ordered drinks. I tried the Spicy Mango margarita. It was delicious and I loved that you get that spicy kick on the get go. Others had the sangria and El diablo. Everyone said the drinks were tasty. :) I had the pollo torta for my entree and it was really good. The chicken wasn't dry and the flavors were nice. Everyone else's food looked delicious too and I didn't hear anyone complain. It was a good night out with good food and tasty drinks.

<Content> Last night we had early evening dinner reservations for a party of six. By the time my wife and I got there (a little late due to rain), the others were already seated and had ordered some appetizers -- chips & salsa and traditional guacamole -- which were quite good. We had a smattering of margaritas, tequila flights, beer and the Ladies Best Friend, which my wife really enjoyed. The drinks were outstanding.We were initially seated inside, but chose to switch to outside once the rain had completely passed and the tables and chairs were wiped dry. Five people had some sort of taco meal and I had steak Mesquite Fajitas. Everyone seemed to enjoy the tacos. The fajitas were not sizzling as one would normally expect. They were just okay.Service at Wedge was exceptional! Although the interior was already crowded, our waitress was attentive inside and remained so once we moved outside.I had not been particularly tempted to go to Wedge since tequila has traditionally upset my stomach. However, I did try some habanero tequila, which was very good -- with no bad effects!We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday girl got a free tequila shot after dinner. Not bad.All in all, we had a delightful evening and will surely return -- perhaps to try one of the many different dinner specials that Wedge has throughout the week.

<Content> There's a cute little tequila bar on Neil st and inside this bar you can find a handful of trendy students having a good time over great drinks. The bar tenders are cute and friendly with their own edgy styles. The wait staff, young and professional with good knowledge of menu items. I decided to give this place a try after reading reviews on it. It was a grey cloudy day and it had just finished raining, as cute as it looked, outside seating was out of the question. But just to let you know, it is available. It is a seat yourself place, So I plopped at the bar, quickly greeted and met with a drink menu. By the by, all cocktails are only $6 on hump day.. I love me some margaritas. The spicy pineapple margarita was my choice tonight and I had that to enjoy while looking over the menu. Finally decided to have the steak torta, carnitas taco, chips and ranchero guacamole. There was no stagnant wait time to place my order as the bartender was very attentive despite the semi crowded bar. It was about give minutes later, boom, my chips come out. The chips are a crunchy kind of good. There are three kinds of guacamole in which I ordered the chunky spicy kind. It was a perfect accompaniment with my drink and anticipation for my meal. Before I can get halfway down my drink and just as I got over the chips, tada... Here comes my food. The timing couldn't be any more spot on. The steak torta was very tasty. It was seasoned and moist with the toasted bread just crisp. The sandwich was pretty darn good. On the plate were also potato wedges that came with aioli dip. Without the dip, the wedges were.. meh. It's all about that dip. Done with my first drink, I gave the bar tender a nod and boom another one came. Completed my steak, on to my taco. The carnitas or pork, was a bit dry and it was just ok. Following the steak, it wasn't great. Finished it anyway, dipped it in the guac and poured salsa on it. That did the trick. Munched on the chips some more as I wrote this review. The environment is clean, friendly and inviting. The wait staff is awesome. The food is great. And the prices are reasonable. The music is trendy and relatively current. I would come back here again for sure. The restroom , sit or squat.  I give it a sit!

<Content> I thought this was a restaurant but it's more like a little bar tucked away in Downtown. It's not amazing.. but I also live in California now so I have ample access to great Mexican food which is cheaper than this.Still.. it was pleasant. The waitstaff was nice. There were a ton of girls here for some reason the night I was there.I did not try their margaritas even though it was a $5 special. I find that sometimes the well drinks at tequila places aren't that good anyways.So I tried their tortilla soup. A bit dissapointing for a Mexican restaurant. My favorite one was at Grove Tavern. Then I tried their carne asada. Large in portion.. ehhh.. it was just okay. It seemed a little dry to be honest. It's kind of weird that I remember El Toro being so much better. But maybe it's because I was a college student back then. Anyways, not too much seating area so I can't imagine getting a seat on a busy weekend night. As for upscale.. ehhhh.. I don't know.. beside it being in downtown, I'm not sure about that.

<Content> Their tacos really are pretty great. Their choices of margaritas are very plentiful and I don't think anyone could be bored with their drink menu. Their fajitas, though, seemed old (not even sizzling when brought out, although still hot-ish). The meat was about 3/4 fat, instead of meat, so eating the fajita tacos was more of a task than enjoying a meal since I had to pull out the fat. I think if I go back, I'll definitely stick to the tacos. Tried the pineapple and mango jalapeno margaritas...the mango is definitely more spicy than the pineapple. Both were decent, though.---the Monday margarita flight is amazing!! Also, the Monday taco special is great. I'd definitely recommend getting tacos when you come here, but steer clear of the steak! The blood orange margarita is now a favorite.

<Content> Food is great! Tastes delicious and even better when they have their $2 tacos on Tuesdays and Sundays. I would go for the Lomo (steak) tacos. Also, the Potato wedges are sooo flame!Service is mediocre but very friendly. Sometimes I feel like the waiters get confused at what they're doing - doing too much or doing too little. Drinks are pretty good. Except they forgot to put salt on the last margarita I ordered... huh?Atmosphere is great. Bathrooms are clean and tidy. Outdoor seating is very nice too.

<Content> So, after our poor experience with Wedge early on, my wife and I decided to give them another try for brunch. BIG MISTAKE. First off, and most importantly, I got food poisoning -- possible culprits were their guacamole that had a faintly moldy taste to it, the chips that were stale, and the mushy rice that seemed like it had been sitting in a steam table all day.Even if you don't buy the food poisoning issue, the food was just awful. Crushed, canned pineapple on the (moldy) guacamole; mushy, gross rice with obviously pre-frozen vegetable medley folded into it; lukewarm coffee. I didn't even get asked how I wanted my eggs on my huevos rancheros, and they came out over-hard (blech). The tortillas (like the chips) were stale. The service was terrible as well, complementing their awful food. Our waitress only brought one of us a water (odd choice), asked for our drink order and walked away after only ONE of us answered, tripped and sloshed my lukewarm coffee all over the mug and saucer, and rather than cleaning it up, simply set it down, asked if I wanted a napkin, and never returned with one -- leaving me with a mug covered in coffee. We had to ask for silverware after our food was delivered. Meanwhile, the other server was shouting across the patio to (who I guess was) the manager on duty for information as to what various items on the menu were. Given there is better Mexican AND brunch options within walking distance of this place, I can't imagine why ANYONE would go here.

<Content> Not your everyday Mexican restaurant; Wedge offers a very stylish bar scene with a unique twist on your typical Mexican food. The fish tacos were AMAZING! My boyfriend tried the shrimp, and we both agreed that the tilapia tacos were better. (I even indulged in a pomegranate margarita afterwards!) Overall great first impression!!

<Content> An excellent Mexican and Tequila bar in this sleepy college town. Everything here is very fresh and made with quality. It is a really small area. A U shaped bar, with a few high top tables, and a bit more private booths. No TV's at the bar, which is saying something in this town. I really like the vibe here. Relaxed and cozy during off hours. Though this small spot gets packed during the weekend. Though the bartenders and waitresses do their best, and the food always seems to come out quick.My family and I found a seat in one of the booths. A smaller menu, with a few aps, tacos, and a few entrees. You can mix and match 5 tacos for $15. I love the Pastor, and Chorizo tacos. The Pastor has a great mix of fruity sweetness and heat. The Chorizo has a really good kick. Fresh as can be guacamole, and the black beans are so flavorful. Certainly not your typical mushy flavorless mass of beans at most mediocre Tex-Mex places.The bar is well stocked. I am not a Tequila guy at all, but the Margaritas here are top notch. They make some really good cocktails with the several house infused Tequilas and a huge selection to choose from.Tasty food that is more than the typical Tex-Mex joint, good bar, good service, and an all around fun place for a meal and a few drinks in this wonderful, but small downtown.

<Content> Disappointing. I wonder if this place imagines itself more as a tequila bar than a restaurant. We went there for a meal. I like fish tacos (some people think it's an odd combination), but this was so overcooked I could barely bite through it. The black bean side was good. The pickled vegetables I think I liked the idea more than the executable. Rice was bland. My dinner companion said his salad was just OK and didn't even bother to finish his margarita. The potato wedge appetizer was good and the aioli was nicely spicy.All in all, it was just ok. I'd probably go back, but I'm not in any rush.

<Content> I have liked how the outside looked ever since I came to UIUC, and I was enticed by their advertisement. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the food. (No comment on the drinks, I didn't have one.) Everything was cold or looked like it had been under a warmer even though we were some of the only customers. The chips were hard and greasy, as if fried more than twice. The guacamole was mediocre at best. The water even tastes awful, no amount of lime could cover it up. The rice looked and tasted old and the way the food was displayed was unappetizing. The service was fine, but she really shouldn't recommend something that tastes gross. Maybe this would be good "drunk food" but I won't be returning to find out.

<Content> What this place has going for it is the Tequila. It is a great spot for professionals to come and get a drink with their friends. Food is tasty but menu options are limited. Seating is also limited because of the size of the restaurant (which is very small) and when it fills up the place gets pretty loud. Lots of solid daily specials for their tacos and drinks.

<Content> My group of four unanimously agreed that this was a good place to have a meal. The menu is different from many Mexican restaurants. The main dishes are tacos and there are some entree options as well as a nice selection of appetizers. I had one chicken (pollo, for your Spanish speakers) taco and one vegetarian of some kind. They were both pretty good. I would be interested in trying other items on another visit. Parking was easy. The best part of the meal was the margerita.

<Content> The outdoor patio is so cute, but seriously it's waaaay too close to the street and parking lot. One does not forget that traffic is nearby due to the frequent noise and the persistent smell of exhaust.However, the drinks are divine (lots of margaritas from which to choose) and apps are varied and pleasing. If the server warns that a dish is spicy, he/she is not messing around. I absolutely love spicy food, and I was not disappointed. Although I miss the old Carmen's restaurant at this same location, Wedge seems like a pretty good addition to downtown Champaign.

<Content> I went here for dinner with a friend this past Thursday evening and we had a great experience from drinks to food to the customer service.We were able to be seated outside on the patio immediately upon arrival which was great! Our server was very friendly and attentive; she provided recommendations for drinks and food and she didn't rush us out after finishing our meal which I really appreciated, especially with it being such a pleasant summer night to sit outside. We both went with the taco dinner-I chose 1 fish taco and 1 of their calabacitas (zucchini blossoms, yum!) tacos, while my friend went with 2 chicken tacos. We also both got one of their lime margaritas. The dinner came with refried beans, rice, and some pickled veggies too! All in all, we were both pleased with our food! The calabacitas taco was my favorite hands-down, but the fish taco was pretty yummy too. I would definitely recommend Wedge as a great spot to sit outside, catch up with friends, and enjoy some Mexican food in downtown Champaign for a fairly reasonable price.

<Content> Just when I was craving some Mexican food, Wedge delivered!The place is stellar for a few different reasons: great guac, nice vibe, and heightened food. If you're a guacamole fan, you will love this place! Place an order for the guac and you will be delighted with the freshness of the guacamole and the freshly fried chips. The chips are crispy, light, and seem homemade (I'm betting they are and if they are not, we need to figure out the brand and get our grubs on them ASAP). I'm not sure about others, but I could just have guacamole for dinner....The menu, on the whole, is on the smaller end, but what you do get is elevated food. What I mean by elevated is: slightly couture food (yea, let's call it that). My tacos came with really delicious pickled veggies, and nicely cooked rice. One criticism of the menu: there are only two vegetarian dishes, but that being said, the two that they have (both tacos) are pretty fabulous. The service here is great, I might add. However, the best part is the ambiance and the vibe. Wedge has a wonderful outdoor area for sitting and dining, bar dining inside, and also typical sit down type dining. Whatever experience you're looking for, they have it here. If you're stopping through, or if your a newbie (like myself), I would highly recommend Wedge!

<Content> Objectively bad. When I found out this place was owned by the people that owned El Toro it all made sense. I do not know how this place or El Toro manage to stay in business considering that they are literally some of the worst "mexican" places I have ever eaten at. A friend of mine ordered the guacamole and reported feeling not well after eating it (she hadn't been drinking so you can't blame the booze).

<Content> Wedge is a restaurant that serves Mexican food, but served and plated creatively. As an appetizer, we ordered a tamale. To our surprise, the tamale came with pickled cactus (which we thought was green beans). I was happy to see the pickled cactus because this side dish is more in line with authentic mexican foodI ordered a steak torta and it was packed with flavor and the steak was nice and tender. The dishes are reasonably priced. I thought the food and service here were really great. Plenty of street parking and free in the evenings.

<Content> Where to begin. This place is a bona fide cluster...you know. I have been wanting to try it after hearing about all the different drinks and tequilas they had, but all that waiting was in vain. First off, I made a reservation, but was placed under a tent in a parking lot on a 45 degree evening. It was warm when we first walked in, but were placed in the back where there were no heater lamps and the temperature was unbearable. We asked to be moved to a table closer to the one functioning heater lamp and were accommodated by the staff (although, in hindsight I wish we wouldn't have been so we would have gotten out then). After being comfortable for about ten minutes the lamp was moved to the back so we were freezing again, but by that point we were ready to leave. We ordered apps to start and got salsa and the ranchero guac. The salsa was good, but the guac was TERRIBLE. it was as cold as the wind blowing under the tent and despite the menu listing it as guacamole with pico de gallo and queso, there was no cheese visible or to taste and as many chunks of tomato and onion as corn (which coincidentally is not supposed to be in this version of guacamole). This led us to believe that they just made one large batch that they could serve as any of the three sub par renditions and stored it in a freezer all day. My drink (the diablo) was satisfactory. My boyfriend ordered the traditional margarita that included patron, patron citronage, orange liqueur and agave nectar. It tasted awful and they upcharged 50 cents for his request of Don Julio Blanco, which is acceptable, but then he was randomly charge $3 for Grand Marnier out of the blue. At that point it wasn't even worth dealing with so we paid and left. Their menu looks pretty good until you start tasting the food, but an individual taco is $3 and a platter of 5 tacos is $15...not a mathematician but that's not really a deal...actually it's not a deal at all. BOTTOM LINE: just don't do it. The food is wanna be upscale but is a flat out miss. The drinks are interesting, but seem to be a crapshoot depending on the specific cocktail.

<Content> Monday night specials are great! The $10 taco sampler and $10 margarita sampler are a great way to get happy hour started. Our server was very attentive and the patio was kept clean. My chair was broken when I sat down, and it ripped my dress a little. I was with a group including my mother, and she thought the clothing on the waitresses was a little risky (shorts were pretty short/tight). I used to work in food and I can see her perspective, but for downtown champaign this kind of apparel is nothing new. I would suggest a visit! Good presentation is also exceptional for the CU area.

I've tried the food and wasn't impressed-Maize is much better. The service is dependent on the folks working. Usually indoor has much better service, though nothing special. The girls working outdoor last night weren't all that friendly or attentive.

<Content> Wow. I was disappointed by Wedge. I had high hopes for this, and my spouse and I went here for a nice date night. The restaurant was packed, and the tables were way, way too close together - our chairs kept bumping into the tables behind us, and the waitress was tripping over chairs trying to get to us. It was uncomfortable and awkward.The service was not good at all. I think it was because they were understaffed and very overcrowded, but I still like it if the waitress checks in more than every half hour, and if we don't have to ask more than once for things like napkins. The real problem, though, was the food. My margarita was nice, and the appetizer was mediocre. I ordered two vegetarian tacos. One of them was just alright, but when I bit into the other, I found ACTUAL FISH BONES. I am not kidding. Not just one. Maybe 5. I had a mouthful of them. It was completely revolting. When I told the waitress, she did take it off our bill, but tried to argue with me about whether it was actually fish bones, and tried to tell me it was "hardened flour." I definitely know it was not. Finally, our dessert was pretty underwhelming - the "death by chocolate" was basically a piece of boxed chocolate cake right out of the fridge, thrown on the very edge of a large plate with nothing else on it.If it weren't for the LITERAL FISH BONES in my vegetarian taco, I probably would have ranked this a two, but sorry - that's just foul.

<Content> I am from Indiana and located this restauant on Yelp. My husband and I were in town for a friend's event and I was excited to find a tequila bar. Online the menu shows several infused and flavored tequilas which I was looking forward to trying. On arrival we learned they have changed their menus and none of these are available. So instead we got margaritas which were good but overpriced for the size $9 each for the size of a small martini. Tacos were Awesome! Chips were greasy and bland. Go for the tacos but not if your looking for infused tequila... their web site is inaccurate and needs updating.

<Content> We had such high hopes! It's a cute restaurant with a lot of ambiance. All the signs of 'winner.' Unfortunately it ended being a disappointing experience! We ordered a number of dishes and everything was bland or awful. The chips were stale, the ceviche flavorless, the salsa watery, and the wedge salad was the worse we ever had. (How do you mess up a wedge salad? ). On top of the bad food....service was slow. And, we sat on the patio next to a chain smoker. On our way home we stopped by another restaurant to 'erase' the bad memories from our palates. We normally enjoy dining out downtown was bar far the worst experience we've ever had.

<Content> "The Abstract": There are better places in town - Maize #1, by far, Huaraches Moroleon #2. Chipotle #3. Not exactly trendy, but the food is better at those places. Was this worth a "date night" with my husband ? Not really. When you have to pay for a baby-sitter a date night better be worth it! Wedge was more miss than hit for us, and while it wasn't terrible, it just isn't worth a repeat for us, especially since we can't really come here with our son - too bar-like b/c most of the tables have high bar stools. There are better (casual and pricy) places for a date in C-U. Pros:The server was great! Mixed up a fancy N/A juice for me since I'm pregnant. The fish tacos- very good- loved the sauce especially. But go easy on the cabbage!The steak tacos w/ poblano - good.Beer prices were reasonable.Meh: Tacos al Pastor - decent, but not worth a repeat visit, IMO. Guacamole - decent flavor- a bit too acidic, not enough salt.Cons: Chips and salsa are NOT free - it's $3 for an order!Beans - fresh out of a.... Can. So easy to make good beans, no excuses here.Guacamole price was high compared to other places around town (and yes, I know the cost of an avocado $0.90-1.79/each- esp owning the El Toros in town, I'm sure the owners get them cheaper than we can at Meijer. Price was $6 for a small portion that was *maybe*a single avocado. Seated right by the door - kept getting interrupted so servers could get liquor out, new patrons walking in - it was freezing! Forget a nice date - we were cold and felt *very* rushed. If you want to get drinks and linger, or dessert, sit in the back. If you want a Jimmy Johns "Freaky Fast" experience, sit in the front. Carnitas taco - absolutely disgusting. It tasted like the meat was rotten. The nuts were whole and just didn't work - would be better chopped up, but they dont' really add to the taco. This actually made me feel sick. My husband agreed.

<Content> I knew this place would be good.My mojito was one of the best I've had. I loved the tacos al pastor. In fact I love anything al pastor.When I heard it was a tequila bar, I assumed there would be tons of latin women in short skirts and loud mariachi musica. No miniskirts tonight. Music was quiet and more classical than I expected. The place is dimly lit, but it looks great.Not sure whether to consider it a bar with food or a restaurant with excellent drinks.

<Content> I got food poisoning from the steak here. So did my friend (who ordered a steak sandwich), and while we were dining, I overheard a phone call that was very likely a possible foodborne illness complaint. (The waitress responded with comments like "I'm so sorry.. no we have not had any other similar complaints.. I am so sorry I will have the GM call you back." I did not think anything of it at the time because I understand it could be anything.)I called, with no mean intentions, to inform them that I, as well as the doctor I went to see at Carle Clinic, were 95% positive that Wedge was the source of this foodborne illness, and the doctor assured me it was NOT the flu. Wedge did not return my 3 calls until 3 days later, and the GM's response was that "I'm pretty confident we are not the source. There is a bad flu going around." Thanks for the call. By the way, unless your steak always tastes that dry, then there probably was something wrong with it. Will not return again.GROSS!

<Content> The food tries its best to be upscale, though I'm not really buying it. The Tacos Pastor and the sandwiches are pretty good, but not super-fancy and a bit small for the price. The place is also a bit tiny, and if you've got a group larger than four, good luck getting seats.Why four stars, then? Because this place has a ton of tequila, and a lot of really good choices. I was a huge fan of the tequila flights (I sprung for a Reposado flight my first time there) and they've got a bar full of bottles you can't get anywhere else. I've found it annoying that I can't get a plain old margarita in the past, and then I remember that I can get a glass of Riazul for $6 and I shut right up. If you're looking to do tequila shots with the limes and the salt and the children in Campustown, this isn't going to do much for you. But if you're looking for a nice place to sit back and enjoy tasting a spirit that people normally don't sip, it's awesome.

<Content> Stopped by on a chilly evening to meet some friends for a birthday party. I would not recommend this restaurant for a group outing as there are very few tables that seat over 4 people. I would recommend (the) Wedge for a date, however! It is cozy and the atmosphere is lively. Servers were attentive and didn't mind our party being laid back about ordering. I tried a delicious au00f1ejo, the guacamole, and a pastor taco. The drinks are reasonably priced for the location and atmosphere, and the bartenders/waitstaff are educated about the drink menu. The guacamole comes in a very small portion but it was quite good (I found the chips to be greasy though). The tacos were tasty.. perhaps not as authentic as el charro or maize but decently priced at $3 for what you get (quite a filling portion and the taco was piled with lots of extras, including roasted pineapple and chile de arbol salsa--yum!). I'm not sure that I will be back immediately but it's a worthwhile spot to check out if you want something a little different for the area.

<Content> For the area, the food is good-- not the best Mexican/Latin food that I have had, but definitely better than the standard El Toro/ Mas Amigos food. It is more Latin-American fusion than anything. Great tequila list. In terms of mixed drinks, wish they had more margarita options like prickly pear, grapefruit, or tamarindo. But I will say that their standard lime margarita, which I judge all tequila bars/ Mexican restaurants against, was pretty good. Just too bad they use orange juice in the mix. All in all I would go back again.

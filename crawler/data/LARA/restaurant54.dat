<Content> Ok so Maize is the most highly rated place on Yelp at UIUC for all cuisines. Combine this with the word-of-mouth it gets around campus and my liking of Mexican food, it was a must try.I came in to order take-out on a Wednesday at 5pm. The place was pretty busy with lots of call in orders, pick-ups and even a few people eating in the small sitting area. It was bustling!I grabbed a menu and took nearly 5 minutes to decide what I wanted. I wanted to try a little bit of everything but still order what I usually would. I finally decided on the Torta Aghoada (asada) and a Taco Americano (pastor). The Torta Aghoada wasn't exactly what I was expecting and part due to my own ignorance. I thought for sure what I was getting was going to be flat with all the ingredients on top. Nope, my memories of high school Spanish deceived me and the torta is a sandwich. I got it confused with a tostada....d'oh! Regardless, I had never had anything like it even in the south suburbs of Chicago where I'm from (maybe I should have Mexican more often). The sandwich was piled with carne asada, beans, cheese, avocado spread, lettuce sour cream and spicy sauce. Unfortunately, the spicy sauce was very overwhelming and I wasn't able to embrace all the flavors of the torta, especially the avocado spread and the meat. In all fairness, I was warned that it was spicy, so I can't complain about it!I also ordered a pastor (pork) taco Americano. I guess the Americano taco comes with more than just a traditional Mexican taco, namely lettuce and maybe even cilantro or onions. This was surprisingly good. The pork had great flavor and didn't taste overly salty. The only thing this taco needed was sour cream!Also included with my take-out order was salsa and chips. I got 2 little cups of salsa and a small bag of chips, which was enough for me since I had ordered a pretty large amount of food, but may not be sufficient for a group of people. The chips were surprisingly good and didn't taste like they were out of a bag. The red salsa was too liquidy to eat just with the chips, but had great flavor. I enjoyed the spiciness and consistency of the darker salsa, but didn't like the taste as much. Either way, they were both decent.I really enjoyed my food from Maize. It's not the crappy Mexican you pay $1/taco for and its also not Rick Bayless expensive, but does sit very well towards the better side of those two and the portion size is very good (I was stuffed after eating everything). I will definitely be back in to try some of their other things. A fair warning though, the menu inside is a little different from the one online (maybe it changes?).

<Content> Restaurant review:Simply delicious. Yelp was spot on that this location has likely the freshest high quality mexican food that may top the best in the US. It was so busy 30 minutes into opening that we had to take our food to go. There is a wide selection of authentic mexican dishes. I ended up with a selection of tacos (steak, pork, and carnitas). Although they were soggy by the time I got home, the ingredients were so fresh and the flavor was perfect. Not too salty and rich in flavor. The prices are perfect a lot cheaper than Rick Bayless Xoco. I just wish it was easier to find parking or even space to eat in. You get chips and 2 types of salsa for free as well even if you are getting carry out. I was surprised I only got 1 bag even with four entrees. I will have to make sure I ask for more next time. Overall this is probably the best mexican restaurant I have ever been toPro: delicious mexican authentic and fresh Cons: very small parking lot and equally small dining areaHidden gem:Free salsa and chips

<Content> I came here on a Saturday for lunch and it was packed so we took our food to go. By the time I was able to eat my torta ahogada, it had already soaked up all the spicy sauce it was swimming in and was soggy and quickly disintegrating. Normally I'm pretty tolerant to spicy foods but all I could taste was spicy. My friend got 3 fish tacos, which were super tiny. He was still hungry afterwards so he had san other full meal. Overall, it did not live up to all the good reviews I kept reading about on Yelp.

<Content> Everything I have gotten from here has tasted amazing. Maize doesn't have much indoor seating and there aren't many parking spots. They always have a long line. Despite all these cons, you can never go wrong when ordering food here. They handle long lines really well. That have gotten used to long lines. My favorite thing to get here is their torta de milanesa. Their chips are really good; They might be a little greasy for some people but I can't get enough of them. They give you two different types of salsa with your food and both of them are really good. Their menu is simple and easy to understand. They also have your classic Mexican sodas. The prices of all their food is cheep. I would pay more for the quality of the food they provide. I hope that in the future they expand their restaurant because the food, service, and environment is really good. If you don't know what to get you should try their quesadillas.

<Content> Fantastic food! Gluten-free friendly, too!My wife and I went there on a whim in between appointments at Carle Hospital. I got two carne asada tacos and she got a chicken taco americano. Good stuff! I grew up in Phoenix, AZ and recently spent 18 mos in Southern California for work and this is the only place in C-U that I have eaten at in which I don't feel like I'm settling for inferior/americanized food. Tasty, authentic and very friendly. My only complaint is that there is so little seating we can't take our kids there to eat - we'll have to do takeout.

<Content> I could write a really long review about this place but I'm going to be short and sweet. I've traveled through all 50 states and eaten at a ton of great restaurants. This little dive in the middle of Illinois is on my top ten list. I happened to see this place on yelp when I was working in town and I just had a feeling it was going to be good. But it exceeded every expectation. They are the real deal! Every single thing I've tried there was absolutely phenomenal! And they aren't just serving up the basic tacos and burritos. No they do gorditas, chalupas, tlacoyas, and much more! The salsa is homemade and is awesome too! Simply put, if you live in Champaign or are traveling through it or anywhere near it this place is a MUST!!!!!!!

<Content> I travel for a living and have probably eaten at over a hundred Mexican restaurants AND I just got back from Mexico, yet Maize is seriously one of the top 5 Mexican restaurants I've been, maybe even top 3. Wow! There are 2 hot sauces served with chips, the red one is ok but the more yellow one is UNREAL. Delish! Very unique sauce!!!Guacamole and chips: A+They have real Mexican sodas like Jaritos and Coca Cola (made with cane sugar, not high fructose corn syrup as in the US recipe).The tacos were the best! I'm sure the tortillas are hand made. Yum! There is very limited seating (less than 20 spots) so it's hard to get in but the wait is well worth it. Thanks for having such high standards, Maize; we the (eating) people appreciate it!

<Content> Everything here is fantastic except the food. I like the fact that it is a small venue and there is a few seats for the patrons. The staff here is extremely friendly and kind. The service is fast when there isn't a long wait. The food is terrible. I ate here a few times last week and each time it was disappointing. The meat (steak) was flawed on many levels. It is a poor cut, not carne asada but something cheaper. The burrito here is small and there is very little meat to begin with. I also tried the tacos and they too were bland. The guacamole is alright and the sauces add some flavor. I am not sure why everyone thinks, writes highly of this place. The owner should do justice and actually use descent meat and not rubbish. You are not doing a service to anyone except your bank account. Sad. TBK would be put this place to shame.

<Content> My absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area (and perhaps of all-time). The ingredients of every entree are fantastically fresh, the food is very quickly served, and the service is fantastic. The menu is extremely simple to navigate, and the ladies who work the register are very kind and helpful. On most days, I eat the veggie burrito here, and I'm always elated to eat it. It's cheaper than Chipotle, and that much tastier!Do note that the restaurant is extremely small, so seating may be tough to find at peak hours, but it is 100% always worth the wait.I made it a point to go to this restaurant weekly instead of attending one of my lectures. That was one of the best decisions of my life.

<Content> It really doesn't get better than this when it comes to Mexican in champaign. From their chorizo burritos and nachos to the tortas and tacos, this place is worth braving that long line that snakes out the door into sub zero temps. Maize always hits the spot (sadly, even when you occasionally find a bit of bone in the chicken.)

<Content> Maize has become something of an obsession for me and many of my friends. We love the tacos there and the consensus is that Maize will be the food of Champaign-Urbana that we miss the most when we move away. (This says a lot because it won out over campus bars with sentimental value, downtown bars with good food/alcohol, Papa Dell's and many other venues.) The place is small, so we tend to call in our order and show up to pick it up. When we've ordered on site, there was usually a line, but the wait was never too long and the food was always worth it. Our favorite item there is the fish tacos, but we also enjoy the chips and salsa. This is definitely the top Mexican place in my opinion and it is super affordable and tasty.

<Content> Maize was one of my go-to lunch places when I lived in Chambana. I'm from New York, so I'm not exactly an expert on Mexican food, but everything I ever got at Maize was excellent--chalupas, gorditas, tacos, and burritos. (The chalupas especially... maybe I should fly back to Champaign for the weekend...) The people working were friendly and the service was prompt. Maize is, food-wise, one of the best places to eat in Champaign-Urbana.The only downside of this place is its tininess. There's room inside for about a dozen people sitting elbow to elbow. I always got takeout, and even standing around waiting for my order I always felt like I was in someone's way. The parking lot is proportionately small too, with only four or five spots, so you may not even be able to park at Maize to get takeout. (Fortunately it's within easy walking distance of campus, and the Green bus line goes right by so you might not have to drive.) If this restaurant were to expand and keep the same menu it would be fantastic.

<Content> My brother (Pat E., Elite Yelper, Pancake Lover) suggested we try Maize for lunch instead of our usual SUnday fare (eggs, pancakes). Our stomaches have been programmed to eat brunch style food on Sundays for as long as I remember. I'll be honest, I was a bit nervous going for Mexican, but it turned out to be a great choice!We arrived around 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was jam packed, which is not surprising because it's the size of a panic room. There's about 12-15 seats total in the place, and it's definitely crammed. They are actually in the process of opening up a sit down place in the area, and per one of the workers, it's in the final stages of opening. This was my bro's 2nd time here, so he took the lead. He ordered a ribeye taco, a fish taco, a hultihoche (corn smut) quesadilla, and a steak tlacoyo. The tlacoyo is bascially an open faced taco.I ordered a steak (carne asada taco), a chorizo taco, a pumpkin flower quesadilla, and a pork (pastor) tlacoyo. We both decided to ask for our sour cream on the side for our tlacoyos, because we like being in control, and we wanted to use the SC for other dishes.Only one word can describe my meal: A-MAIZE-ING (I'm sure I'm the first person to use this)!Our food came out promptly. Our drinks were always full, and everything was extremely flavorful, including the salsas that came with our chips (we each had a few).The tacos were topped with cilantro and onions. Quick note: Everything here is made with corn tortillas (get that white crap outta here!) Also, gluten free, if you swing that way. The carne asada was so good, and they didn't skimp on the portion size either! The chorizo was zesty but not spicy, which I preferred. I was expecting it to be sliced up like a sausage, but it was actually ground chorizo. Either way, the tacos were amazing! My only complaint.... too small! But for 2.25 a taco, a very fair price.The pastor tlacoyo was the first dish I actually dove into. Topped with cheese, I added my sour cream quite liberally anyways, and I did not regret it! The pork did not have as much flavor as the other meats, but that's not to say it was bad. Still very good!! I added the darker salsa to the tlacoyo, which may have masked the flavor of the pork, but I'm not sure. You have the option of grilled or fried for this dish, and I went with grilled.Finally, to the quesadilla, my favorite part of the meal. Filled with cheese and pumpkin flower, this was the best tasting dish for me. I also liked how the quesadilla came with lettuce and tomato, which can be placed on top or eaten by itself, which is what I did, along with the lighter salsa. At the end of the meal, I added sour cream to the top, which was amazing!All in all, our 8 dishes added up to 25 dollars. Very reasonable for the amount of food! If you decide to eat here, yes, it's cramped, but I thought it was a cool experience. I thought it was weird how a group of 3 adults came with a baby, and nestled up in the corner. Not really a great place for kids, let alone babies.There were plenty of to go orders being placed and picked up while we were there. They are very fast in the kitchen!Highly recommended! After my last mexican dining experience (Fernando's in Chicago), this was the polar opposite. Great food, service, prices, and memorable, for all the right reasons. I can't wait to head back for my next visit!

<Content> I went here with three other teachers on a Wednesday night. To say this place cramped would be THE understatement of the year. The second time I went here I visited with my twin brother. Both trips were FANTASMIC (yep). It did open us up to hearing a conversation that two of the biggest nerds on Illinois campus were having. It was hilarious because while they were talking about geometry, machines, and other things nerds talk about they were swearing like sailors. So not scientific, bro! "My flux compactor connected to the tangent...blah". The second time I visited, I was treated to a conversation about Ernest Hemingway and "Old Man and the Sea". That was good. The lady who was talking about said author also mentioned how much she enjoyed Franklin BBQ in Austin, Texas. She was wearing one of those baby in front backpacks with a baby inside. Folks, in a restaurant this small, there is no point in having children. Get it to go!I was told that they will be opening up a sister restaurant in the old Cafe Luna location. It was hilarious because the cashier told me that this was the case and I acted like I knew EXACTLY where it was...which I do not! HEHE. It should be open by the end of 2013...they're just waiting on permits. It will also include appetizers and drinks...heck yeah, college!This place seems authentic; what I mean by authentic is not made from a package. MADE IN HOUSE! As a matter of fact, the grads and undergrads lining up out the door made me realize...THIS IS AUTHENTIC...and their prices are excellent! I ended up paying 10.32 for three items. The second time I went here I got an extra taco and it was a great choice!Among the simple menu, I decided to go with a fish taco, pumpkin flower quesadilla, and asada tlacoyo. All were fantastic! The workers were very nice and accommodated all my complicated questions (How do you say "tlacoyo" and it is all grilled, right?). I love how they have masa...corn based tortillas! So great! Get that white flour sh*t outta here! Those empty carbohydrates...I AIN'T GOT THAT KINDA TIME! My friends ordered some burritos, quesadillas, and some guacamole. IT WAS LIKE AVOCADO HEAVEN!I've also sampled the ribeye taco and the corn smut tortilla. All the items I've had here are fantasticThe mild AND hot salsas were excellent as well! I had to order mas (Spanish)I don't always eat Mexican in CU...but when I do...I do Maize. Simply amaizing. Pun entirely intended. I'd would order to go if I come again or just try their sit down (done by the end of the month).Based on the food (6), service (5), and restaurant experience (4), I have to give Maize a 5 star review. If this place was bigger, I would go every weekend. Actually, I might go every weekend anyway. It has a street food feel to it. This is one of my top CU area joints! Guy Fieri and Jimmy John (yes, that Jimmy John) have tried this place...which actually led me to find it. I highly recommend!

<Content> Maize is closer to a fine restaurant than a storefront. This would be one of the top 5 Mexican places in Chicago, even.Everything is seared to a crust, exactly how it's supposed to be. Masa is pressed to order as sopes, tacos, huerachas, etc. Ingredients are generously applied, almost absurdly so. They have two salsas, and both are excellent complements to their recipes. Prices are low, you can eat like a king for under $10. Food comes out quick, in less than 10 minutes.Most of all, everything tastes phenomenal. This is a special place and I hope UIUC appreciates it.

<Content> aaaaahhh-MAIZE-ing!!! And, no... this place is not over-hyped! This little taco shack on the corner of Green & 1st is life changing. Friendly staff that serve up fresh, hot, flavorful food with smiles! Yes, it is tiny and cramped (bar seating for less than 15 people). Yes, the parking lot sucks. Yes, there are times where the line is out the door and around the building. But it is all worth it!! I'd highly recommend the Volcanes. Grilled cheese taco with your choice of meat... It's like a quesadilla and taco had a tasty love baby. Yummy! I really enjoyed the carne asada, pastor and chorizo. The chips and salsa were delicious, too! Btw... just found out that they are opening a second location this summer on Chestnut where Luna used to be!Peace, love & tacos!

<Content> I had heard a lot about Maize before I tried it myself. Everyone who I talked to seemed to have enjoy their meal there, so I was rather excited when I pulled up together with a friend yesterday evening. My first thought was "Wow, they weren't kidding when they said that it's small." It seems like a perfect place to get food to-go and seating is very limited.I ordered a burrito with pastor and my friend ordered torte with pastor. The food was really well priced and arrived at the speed of light! We had a seat at the counter and ate our meals there. The staff quickly served up our Jarritos (before we sat down even) and chips together with a delicious spicy habanero (I think) sauce. We were both satisfied with the burrito and the torte and enjoyed our dinner at Maize. Highly recommended if you're looking for a quick, delicious, affordable meal!

<Content> If you have any bad things to say about this restaurant, then you have issues. Everything on their menu is authentic and fantastic. The only down side I can possibly think of is the fact that it's good is too good, and there will always be a line to place your order for food. But do not let that turn you away! You can always place your order early through phone and pick up your food when you arrive! That's what i do when I am tight on schedule. I honestly cannot recommend any specific dishes because they are all very good! I usually just ask the cashier what they are in the mood for, and I will take that recommendation. The restaurant itself is small so there is very little chance that you can actually sit down to eat on site. But if you do, definitely have their chips and salsa. They are worth every second of wait! They also provide some authentic Latino drinks that you do not usually see everywhere else!The price for the restaurant is definitely reasonable. It may be a little out of students way, but definitely worth the effort, especially if the weather is getting better!

Burritos and tacos are on the menu of course, but the carne asada and fajita plates are wonderful.Parking is difficult (there are only a few spots) and at times there may be a long line, takeout service is quick - you can also call ahead and your order will be ready for pick-up when you arrive.

I love that they make their own corn tortillas (which are gluten-free, friends). They also fry or grill any meat of your choosing. I met the owner once to interview him for Best of CU for Buzz, and he was the sweetest guy from Mexico City. He recommends the authentic fish tacos. I love their pumpkin flower and corn fungus quesadillas and their chicken volcanes, but all their menu items are perfectly delicious. All orders come with a side of chips with two types of lip-smacking salsa.Rather long wait sometimes, but just go at odd hours or endure the wait. They have an array of authentic Mexican sodas waiting inside as well. Seating is rather fickle and sparse, so get ready to carry out unless you're eating plus one. Enjoy!

<Content> Just passing through on our way from WI to Indy, we stopped because of the positive yelp reviews and we were trying to make time on our trip. A few things stand out:1.). Yes the place is small...however we found seating as soon as we ordered as the turnover was quick +12.). The staff was very friendly +13.). Chips and salsa were delivered almost instantly (and free) when we sat down and noticed that's the standard here. The chips were firm and thick, solid combo with the spicy two salsas they served +24.). Prices and food both good, bordering on great! +1 (I had the burrito and a taco americano with chorizo, the burrito was delish and would have been enough by itself )5.). Speed - we were in and out in 20-30 mins

<Content> YUM YUM YUM!I would have to say they have the best Mexican food on campus!They have everything from tacos and burritos to flautas and tortas. I can't even put into words how delicious everything thing is. I really wish I could give them 5 stars but can't because of their limited seating areas, such small store space, and limited parking. Really, other than that. It's wonderful :)

<Content> Let me start by saying the food was awesome. It was hot, it was flavorful, and after I ordered it was in front of me in under 5 minutes. The chips and salsa that come with it are also pretty tasty.The establishment itself is tiny. we are talking maximum occupancy of 15 kind of tiny for seating, there is the low bar at the counter and the high bar lining the exterior windows and that is all. Very cramped, makes this place more of a to go only restaurant unless you like feeling like a sardine.The parking lot was even worse, there are maybe 6 spots to park and 2 are handicap spots. I got lucky and pulled into one with my tiny Kia Soul that barely squeezed into the spot on the end simultaneously pissing off the other 12 cars trying to figure out how to park at this establishment and not having much luck.Overall, The food is great, get it to go and walk there if you can because you are not going to find a place to park.

<Content> I'd like to give this place a second shot after an underwhelming first visit. I got some sticker shock (after being told how cheap it was), paying almost $10 for a fish taco and a very small tostada, both of which were good for Champaign, but a bit bland. I'm hoping other menu items will be more fulfilling, and at the very least filling.I'd also assumed that, since they apparently offer free chips and salsa at the restaurant, I would get some with my takeaway order. I was disappointed to find out, upon arriving home with my order, that is not the case, so it felt like an even worse deal than I originally thought. I will definitely give it a second shot now that I know what to expect, but I wish they had their prices listed on the website and that they made it clear you only get chips and salsa with dine-in service. Service was friendly and fast. Parking is horrendous (only a few parking spots, and very limited street parking nearby), but that is no fault of the restaurant; just be aware you might have to circle the block a few times before a spot opens up.

<Content> LOVE this place! I'm addicted. I could come here everyday. Everything on the menu is pretty cheap and super affordable. Every time I come, there is a huge line out the door, so be prepared to wait. It is definitely well worth the wait! The place is small too, so be ready to fight someone for a seat. Here's what I've had:-fish tacos (small but good)-tortas (I've tried carne asada, chorizo, and milanesa)-queso fundido with carne asada (melted cheese - really greasy)Their tortas are the best! They are only around $5 and it's a pretty large portion. Also, each meal comes with free chips and salsa!!

<Content> LOVE this place. Don't let its small size or hole-in-the-wall style intimidate you. Their steak burritos are the best in town (in my opinion). Great value (burrito and chips are under $6) when weighting portions, price, and quality. And you get fresh, warm, homemade chips and their own unique salsa free with every burrito order. Their service is quick and their staff is friendly. Townies know to call ahead and order your food if you are going to do takeout. Then when you get there you can just walk right in, pay, and leave! If your in Chambana and havent tried this place you are missing out!

<Content> Dear Maize, On planet earth, a torta is a crispy bolillo roll with various fillings, a kind of a sandwich that one holds in one's hands and sinks one's teeth into. It really doesn't matter if you can point to some group of earthlings who recognize a torta by any designation to be presented as a soppy, glue-like, waterlogged roll to be eaten out of a bowl with a spoon. There are exceptions to all good things, and your decision to serve a sandwich as a soggy concoction floating in broth makes your taqueria is one of them.

<Content> Arguably some of the best, well made and most authentic Mexican food you will get in Champaign and maybe even the state.I'd like to recommend something but with how awesome everything on the menu is, you can't go wrong. The chalupas are delicious meat pockets, the tostadas expansive and the burritos are a deal at what they charge. My favorite 1-2 punch is getting a burrito and quesadilla and eating the quesadilla late at night.Dining in can be kind of a chore as the place seriously fits about twelve people (not comfortably) but their takeout is fast and if you are a lazy repeat customer (like me), phone ordering takes less than a minute. Add in the politeness of the staff and now you know why I eat here at least once a week...

<Content> Cinco Estrellas?? That does not do this place justice. This jawn is Heisenberg level Mexican cuisine, at a Los pollos hermanos price point.Every time I have eaten at maize, the food has been consistently fresh & consistently delicious. The proportions are generous, with no corners cut that I can tell ( except lettuce at the bottom of the guacamole to make it appear as a larger quantity, but that's common practice everywhere)The only thing this place needs to do is obtain a bigger space or open another location.. It kinda cramps my style

<Content> Let's be clear- the 5 stars is about the food and the service. This isn't a fancy 5 star restaurant but that's not what the stars mean on Yelp- as we all (should) know!We moved here from Southern California in August, so it's safe to say we've had our share of excellent traditional Mexican food. Since our first trip to Maize we go there at least once a week- it's so good.BE PREPARED: Parking can be a problem and it's almost always packed. People frequently come in and order for takeout. In our experience, by the time we order a seat almost always clears up. We have never taken it to go. If you eat there, you get free (freshly made!) chips and salsa while you wait for your food. Since it's just the two of us, we have always been lucky. If you have a big group, I'd suggest ordering it to go and eating at home or having a picnic. You can call your order in too, which is nice.The food is always ready super fast, so even if you order to go, you won't wait long. The staff is extremely kind and happy to answer questions if you're not sure what something is. I've tried many things on the menu but keep coming back to the tacos- chicken or fish are my fav- because of the RIDICULOUSLY amazing corn tortillas. So. Good.Word on the street is that they'll be opening a larger location near the Amtrak in Champaign soon.

<Content> Finally went to Maize for the first time today after reading a bunch of reviews online. Maize does live up to its hype. For such a small space, the owner did a great job making this place feel warm and inviting. Seating is cramped and very limited, but I guess Maize is one of those hole-in-a-wall neighborhood restaurants that everyone loves. Food was very fresh and authentic, and everything tasted good. The portion was small, so you're going to have to order a couple of things, but price is reasonable for the quality of food. Service was also very friendly too.Pros: authentic, fresh mexican food. very friendly service. Cons: limited parking and seating.

I got chicken tacos and they came with complimentary chips - love that, although I could've used a little more salsa. Since it was free, I can't complain. Tacos were SO GOOD. Very Mexican-street-food kind of tacos. yum yum yum! She got a torta which she said she's had before and loves. This will definitely be a regular place to hit up when I am visiting U of I!Only downside was that we planned on eating there but it was packed so we ended up getting our food to go.

<Content> Disappointed in the Mexican food choices in Champaign? El Sombrero, Dos Unrealness, fiesta of mexico!?. You should be disappointed because the food is mostly just reheated.Ready to level up? Enter Maize. All ingredients are fresh and made on the spot. Seriously you can see the tortilla making presses in the back. I sometimes wonder if they have lettuce and tomato plants back there because it tastes that fresh.I eat here minimum 3 times a week. Not only is this the best Mexican food in town but probably the best food in town.Favorite items? Burrito + Avocado, Fish Tacos, Guacamole, Steak Tacos, Tostadas, Chicken Volcanes... seriously tho... everything on the menu is best. Level Up to Maize.

<Content> I've experienced Maize 3 times now, so I feel like nothing can be chalked up to just bad luck at this point.I've had the tacos all 3 times. Carne asada. Sadly, just not good (I know, I should've tried something else...). Meat is dry, served in a relatively small soft tortilla with a bed of mostly cilantro and some onions. Rice is a bit dry as well. Chips and salsa are free with every order. Hard to complain about free, but... I'll try. The chips are okay, but the salsa is basically bland tomato water with some tomato chunks. The guac here is good though. 2 tacos cost almost $5; too expensive for me considering I'm still hungry afterwards.This might be an issue only with takeout though, as the food I received looks different from the images here of food that was dine-in.Service was great. Everyone I interacted with on the staff was very nice and friendly. Food took just about 2 or 3 minutes from ordering to get to my hands.Be prepared to get it takeout, as seating is very minimal here, 12-15 people max at any time.Random fact: 2 of the 3 times I had Maize was at a Yelp tech talk.

Whenever someone visits me from out of town, the two places I take them to eat are here and Black Dog. The only person I have ever known who doesn't like Maize was one of my old roommates... but he also used to put ketchup and cheese on bread and call it a meal, so take that with a grain (or heaping mound) of salt.

<Content> First, Maize is very good in the authentic Mexican taqueria tradition. They have a number of grilled or fried items from which to choose, as well as a couple of good sides like guacamole. On each item, you can choose from the following meats: carne asada, chicken, chorizo, or pastor. My favorite is the flavorful pastor (marinated roast pork). Common co-toppings include a wonderful fresh, salty cheese, salsa fresca, sour cream, and cilantro. A variety of salsa comes with, and each bite of every item is delicious, with or without the salsa, which is very good. Tacos, burritos, tostadas, tortas, tlacoyos, challupas, quesadillas, gorditas, flautas, and huarches are all available. Honestly, they are variations on a theme, rather than distinctively different. Choose your texture. I'm an especially big fan of the tlacoyos (stuff served on top of a piece of grilled chewy flat bread -- you can get the bread fried, but grilled is better). Some of the items do offer interesting add-ons. For example, you can add pumpkin flowers or or mushrooms to the quesadillas.Maize is located in a small converted space, with just a few seats around the main counter and a counter that runs immediately behind along the back wall. Seats are counter stools. At busy times, customers who are waiting for food get packed in too, or wait outside. The parking lot is equally small. We prefer to get our food to go, and it is always well worth the trip. Prices are inexpensive for the quality -- an excellent value.

<Content> Their food is good, inexpensive, and fast. If you go during the off peak hours and order a burrito they'll frequently have it out to you faster than you can sit down and pull your phone out. As other people have said it's very cosy. If you're more than two people eating during peak times you're probably better off getting take out.The small parking lot during crowded times can make for fun watching as you eat. Note they don't have a bike rack, and there isn't anywhere good out front to lock a bike up. It's bit annoying (but all their pluses more than make up for it).

<Content> I've eaten mexican in Chicago. I've eaten mexican in southern California. I've eaten mexican in Texas. I've eaten in Oaxaca mexico. This place is right up there. I'll admit the first time I went I was skeptical. It's way too small, and the chips and salsa leave something to be desired (but, seriously, who cares?). Once the food came I was absolutely convinced by the hype. The al pastor buritto was incredible. The flavors were authentic, the meat was moist and delicious, and everything about that burrito told me that this place was a winner. Every time I have been back since the food has been just as good. Tortas, tacos, burritos, flautas, sopes, you name it; this place has it all and it's all fantastic. I have yet to try something that didn't leave me full, satisfied, and waiting to be hungry again so I could come back.This place is sensational. The prices are low and the food is first rate. Just, do yourself a favor and order to go. The place simply isn't big enough to house all the hungry maize addicts trying to get their fix.

I could tell that everything was made in house and the cooks took pride in their food. The atmosphere was hectic but that's to be expected because it has very limited seating and most of the patrons do carry out.  One of the girls working said they were opening a dine in location at some point. Sooner is better as I can't wait to sit down to a good meal from here. -one star off for limited parking and very limited seating.

Suddenly you feel like Chipotle is bland. This thing roars with lime and texture and spice. I had the spicy salsa--it's bright yellow and has layers of flavor. And the staff I've encountered are warm and quick to help.This place looks like a hole in the wall on the corner of 1st and Green--I don't know what they're gonna do, but I hope this place is a permanent addition to Champaign and Campustown.

<Content> This place is the best Mexican food I've ever had! Easily the best Mexican food in Champaign. My only complaint is how small this place is. They really need to expand and serve alcohol. Also, since they're so close to campus, the crowd can be a little unbearable.

<Content> Maize is my favorite restaurant ever. The tacos are even better than tacos in Los Angeles. Try the tomatillo salsa. It's heavenly. Unfortunately, I no longer live in Champaign, so I can't eat there every day. Man, what I wouldn't do for that tomatillo recipe. I LOVE YOU, MAIZE!

<Content> Best Mexican in Champaign, huge affordable menu, very fresh ingredients. The only minus about this place is the lack of inside seating, it's basically a take out spot. When they open their spot downtown Champaign I think it will be one of the premier spots in C-U.

<Content> This place is amazing! We were driving through Illinois on our way to Wisconsin and read some positive yelp reviews and decided to try Mexican for lunch!Yes, it is very small and you need to wait your turn for seating, but the turnover was quick and once we sat down we got our drinks and free chips and salsa immediately (great chips and two sauces).My husband ordered the carne asada torta ahogada. And it was huge and he said the special spicy sauce was perfect: hot AND tons of flavor. He also ordered the chalupas. There were actually three per plate-it was probably the best shaved pork I've ever had. Either of those dishes alone would have made a substantial size lunch. I ordered the chicken gordita (I think it was supposed to come with beans, but I'm glad it didn't, the chicken was so flavorful and enough on it's own). Lastly (I know we were pigs today!) we had a beef volcane. The volcane was probably our least favorite, but the tortilla it was on, and the cheese it was covered in, were delicious (not soggy at all).Highly recommend for a low-key, cheap, fun, filling meal!

<Content> OK, I was suspicious that Maize was writing their own reviews, but after a Friday evening visit in October, 2011, I now understand why their growing but new fan base is over-the-top loyal and giddy about the joint. The atmosphere was intimate, the parking lot was packed, there were no available stools. We overheard a customer who had been there before gushing to his friends about what to order. So I get the impression this is one of those start-ups that folks feel strongly about supporting and want to see succeed. Me too.Small portions, but very reasonably priced (most things under $3). Spend $8 and you will have a full meal. The free chips are unique because they have dark specks in them and seem drier and crunchier than other Mexican restaurants in this genre. The free salsa is excellent.

<Content> WARNING - this restaurant does not operate in a drug-free zone. That is the only thing that explains why they can serve up Mexican food that tastes so good that it is addictive. If the DEA ever raids the place and prevents them from spicing their food with crack, than their food will start to taste like all of the other places that attempt to serve Mexican food. We ate a taco, volcanoes (tostadas), huaraches and carne asada. You could not go wrong with anything they served up. The only downside was the lack of parking. Come prepared to wait for a seat in a small crowded diner or bring a blanket to spread out on the ground outside for a picnic lunch. No matter where you eat, the food is worth the trip.

<Content> Sometimes when something is overhyped, you set yourself up for disappointment. I wish I had visited Maize before I had heard anything about it, I think my expectations were too high. After reading reviews, it sounds like the prices have gone up since opening and it is not necessarily a bargain.The parking lot is very small and awkward since it is on the corner of a fairly busy intersection. The staff is super friendly and helpful and will answer any questions you have. If you are short on time, this is a great place to go since the food comes out FAST, unless you have to wait in a huge line to place your order.I tried a fish taco and a pastor tlacoyo, both are items I have not seen on menus at Mexican restaurants around town. They were both very tasty and authentic. The sauce on the pastor tlacoyo was delicious and I was delighted by the authentic cheese and crema topping. Chips and salsa were good, but they're not my favorite in town.I would go back and try their torta and any entree that has squash blossom or huitlacoche.

<Content> In the few years I've been on campus, I've been consistently disappointed with what passes for Mexican cuisine around here. That being said, Maize is rocking my world! The food is super-authentic, perfectly fresh and wonderfully inexpensive -- I've eaten there twice in a week! They even have legitimate vegetarian options.I also love the decor. Most of the Mexican places on campus are gross inside, but this place is clean and has a nice vibe. Plus, the folks that own it are incredibly nice.A+++, would/will eat again.

<Content> THE GOOD: It's a cut above your standard mexican food. They serve limes with their dishes and they come hot and fresh. Some different menu items than your typical champaign el toro/terero/etc.THE BAD:I truly believe this place chose such a small venue to give the illusion of a busy restaurant to generate buzz about their business. STAY OR GO?: I would not go back to this place. Mexican tastes ALMOST the same everywhere you go in town. Other places in town you get to sit, be served, and relax (and the price is about the same).

<Content> If you are looking for authentic Mexican food in the CU, this is your place. Be warned, the place is very small, and seating and parking are limited. For me, this isn't a problem, and it just gives it a more intimate authentic hole in the wall atmosphereThe chips and salsa are divine, and free if you dine in. I always get three tacos-- my favorites are asada, chorizo, and chicken. Although I can't speak to the other items on the menu, the food I have had there has tasted so fresh that I wish I went there more. The last major pro-- SUPER CHEAP!

<Content> This is the corner where business comes to die, but I hope this one makes it. As soon as the pedestrian white walls of Ye Olde Donut & BBQ and, more recently, the late Derald's Diner were washed in the much richer brick red paint, the folks across the street at El Charro got off their asses and re-painted their "Tortas - Tacos - Burritos" signs. American capitalism at work.Seating is limited at Maize and there are no public bathrooms. It is counter service with about ten barstools.

<Content> Amazing. The rest of the Mexican restaurants in Champaign do not even compare to Maize. I got the Volcanes --- truly one of the best dishes I've consumed in a while! The good things about Maize: (1) Maize had fresh ingredients. The cilantro tasted like it had just been harvested from a garden this morning. Seriously. Most of the other Mexican restaurants in the area either do not use cilantro or use barely any at all, so Maize's generous serving of fresh cilantro was a definite plus.(2) Maize appeared very sanitary and clean. Some the restaurants on campus are somewhat grungy, but this restaurant seemed very well-kept and clean.(3) The decor and music put me in a very good mood. From the outside, Maize may look a bit drab, but once you are inside, it's bright and colorful. I kind of wish the place were bigger and had more parking, but I don't really think it's a huge deal. The small size of the restaurant gives it "character."

<Content> This place is so small they have less than one table. But it's worth squeezing in. In a nutshell, it's the kind of amazing Mexican place that I remember from my youth in California. I never thought I'd find anything like it in the midwest. After eating at Maize I may never be able to eat at another mexican place in Champaign-Urbana -- they all compare so poorly to this one. Beware, once you eat here there's no going back!I have tried the fancier and more exotic fillings on the menu (the pumpkin flower and the mushroom) and the more authentic formats for them (huaraches, taco mexico) and they were all good, but I liked the "standards" even better. If I were you, I'd start with the simplest: tacos pastor with cilantro and onions. Amazing! Just amazing.

<Content> Maize Mexican Grill is by far the best Mexican food in Champaign-Urbana. It is the only Mexican place that does not taste as if the food just got re-heated in the microwave. While they are not as cheap the other Mexican places in town, the quality by far trumps the cost and quantity you would receive at other places. I have tried a variety of their items. I really like their fish tacos and veggie burritos. The sopes are very delicious as well. Also, the hot and mild sauces that come with the tortilla chips are very good. As stated in all the other reviews, this place is very small and have limited (3) parking spots, making it very hard to obtain food when you have a craving for it. You can always call in your order for pick-up but there is still the issue of finding parking to go pick you food up. What I would suggest is they get a FOOD TRUCK that is goes around campus town, where they make some real bank. Despite this big negative of space and parking, the food makes for a worthwhile trip.

<Content> This is a small establishment with about 5 parking spots. There are about 16 counter seats. We ordered Carne Asada and Fish Tacos (around $3 per) which were both tasty and not too greasy. We were recommended another open faced item on fried dough which was great as well. Chips and Salsa were offered as we waited for our tacos. The food was tasty/fresh, service was efficient, and overall a positive experience. Whoever was running the cashier was super patient, had a genuine smile, and was very calm even when it was busy (which seems like the line is always out the door). Can't wait to go back!

<Content> I've only stopped in for carry-out once, so maybe I need to try something else on the menu. I have to assume I'm missing something for this place to be getting such rave reviews. I am a taco fiend and wasn't impressed, especially with the fantastic El Charro being right down the street. I ordered two of their "Taco Mexica" with chicken, because I'd heard good things about their "grilled cheese taco." The chicken was shredded and barely had any taste to it, which docks major points in my book. There was basically no seasoning in the meat at all, which is why El Charro wins the chicken taco contest by a landslide. The grilled cheese taco thing was interesting, but I honestly couldn't taste the cheese much, and I covet my cheese, so again, I didn't love it. The traditional cilantro and onions topping gave it props in my book, but without tasty meat, what's the point? Maybe their beef is the way to go. They include free chips and salsa with your order, and here again I was disappointed. (I'm such a jerk judging free food, aren't I?) The salsa just wasn't my style. I'm basically obsessed with the tomatoey, cilantro-filled stuff El Toro will dole out for free, and I just can't get into spicy traditional salsa. That's a personal preference, though.The guacamole looked really good, but it was mighty expensive. It's $5.95 served with chips, and you get a giant saucer of it, but El Toro serves up some great guac at only $3.50. (And of course you get free chips and salsa at El Toro.)I might go back only to try out their fish tacos and guac, just to give the place one more shot. Good fish tacos is the only thing C-U is missing as far as Mexican food goes.

<Content> Wow. I've been hearing good things so I decided to do some firsthand research and I must admit, I was worried about walking into a completely empty restaurant. Well, let's just say that by the time I left, the place was packed and for good reason, this is *literally* the best Mexican food you can get in Champaign-Urbana. What I would recommend is the Tacos Mexica which are like regular tacos except there's some grilled brown cheese on there. The cheese adds a bit of saltiness, the browned part adds some crunch and the melty part underneath adds a nice creamy texture to the party. The carne asada is salty and has some nice savory bits from the char of the grill while the pastor is spicy and crunchy.This place is as good as the stuff you'd get at little taquerias on the southside of Chicago so I very highly recommend you stop in.

<Content> Best and most authentic Mexican in C-U, some of the best Mexican I've ever had, period. (I love RIck Bayless's places in Chicago, I think he'd approve!) Love the Tlacoyo, sopes, and quesadillas. Tortillas are freshly made, with masa, not the prepackaged factory made ones. This is almost impossible to find these days, even in Mexico! CU is lucky! Guac is good.. Queso fundido is fantastic. When asked grilled or fried, ask for fried. Trust me.Cons: very small, always packed, only counter top/bar stool seating, which is hard if you have kids or want to go with a group.

<Content> I am a taco snob! I am fully aware, but this place absolutely lives up to my expectations. I spent the majority of my 20's in Southern Cali so I've definitely done my research when it comes to tacos. The tortillas are made fresh in the kitchen, the meat is well seasoned and the toppings are perfect! I love the Lomo Mexica (not on the menu) which is basically the grilled cheese rib-eye taco. Yasss honey! The steak, fish, pork and chicken are great too (in that order) I have also tried their sopes which are totally yummy, but the tacos are definitely the main event! Stop by when you have time and patience to deal with the lines and limited seating. If I had to state one downside it would be the chips which are nothing to rave about but hey this place is A1!

<Content> After reading all the rave reviews I had to check Maize out and finally this past week I had a chance. I ordered for take-out, knowing that it would probably be packed and when I got there it was indeed filled with people. I ordered a handful of items for me and my roommate. I got a rib-eye taco, a chorizotaco, and a pastor taco. The rib-eye was thinly sliced and was of good quality. The grilling gave it a little bit of char and was tasty. I did feel that it was a bit underseasoned and could have used a touch more salt. The chorizo taco had your standard ground chorizo, but was delicious. The pastor taco was the best of the three, great flavor and a touch of heat. As others have mentioned the tortillas are handmade and they're fantastic. A bit chewier than your typical store bought tortilla and adds an element of texture to their dishes. My roommate got a fish taco, a carne asada taco, and a grilled chicken quesadilla. He seemed to enjoy everything as well, but don't have much commentary beyond that.  Definitely a place worth visiting regularly, seeing that their prices are low and the food is great.

<Content> I came here for lunch on Friday. It was pretty quiet- only a couple other people eating. I had the chicken quesadilla and what was supposed to be a carne asada taco with no onions. Prices were fairly low and the food came rather quickly. First off, they messed up my order as the taco wasn't carne asada. Then when I sent it back and it returned, the meat was carne asada, but was covered in onions. By this point, I was over it, so I didn't bother to send it back a third time- just didn't eat it. I was expecting more from this place because of all of the rave reviews. To be honest, my quesadilla was really oily (on the outside!) and extremely bland. It was missing heat, spice, anything to liven up the taste. Overall, I wasn't too impressed and doubt I'll be back. It just wasn't all that.

<Content> This is a little hidden gem with the best Mexican food in town. The place is very small and cramped, and there is often a line out the door. However, the tacos de carne asada (steak tacos) are to die for - made with corn tortillas, cilantro and onions, just the way they are supposed to be. The burritos are passable, but stick with the tacos if you want rather authentic Mexican food. The price is not the cheapest compared to say, Dos Reales (another decent Mexican place in town), you do not get any sides and the drinks do not come with refills. However, it is definitely more authentic. Dining in at this place might feel rushed since it is so small - best get your food to go.

<Content> This place is fabulous. The food is fresh and deliciously seasoned. The prices are very reasonable, especially in comparison to all the other Mexican places in town, and the decor is cheerful and clean. I would highly recommend the Sope al pastor cooked on el comal (not fried). And the tlacoyo was also delicious. Husband had a burrito al pastor, which he loved. They give you free chips and homemade salsa. We both left feeling full and happy.The owners are very kind and personable. I will definitely go back again.

<Content> This place is tiny, which often leads to tricky parking situations and lines out the door, but don't be dissuaded! Everything I've tried has been fresh and flavorful, and absolutely not drowning in grease (which is often my complaint when it comes to Mexican food, particularly in the midwest). My current favorites are the guacamole, veggie chalupas, and pumpkin flower quesadillla. I'm slowly working my way through the veggie and fish menu as I return and return again, snacking on the complimentary chips and adding delicious warm salsa to all of the selections. Yum!Lately I've been calling for take-out more often because the logistics of getting to Maize and finding space are not always easy... and so I would love if it could expand a bit and get some better bike / car parking. (Bike rack, please?) But that doesn't seem to be worth knocking off a star -- and other than that, I wouldn't want them to change anything.

<Content> Maize, what can I say about you? It was love at first bite.This is authentic Mexican food in Champaign. The chicken, fish, and ground beef burritos are amazing. The ground beef, chicken, and chorizo tacos are great. The volcano taco is fantastic. Catch my drift? And free chips with any order...what more could you ask for?Well if you want to get specific, my only complaint would be that the place is small and so is the parking lot (5 spots maybe?). It's always crowded, but always worth the wait. Call and place your order in advance so you can skip the line.

<Content> The food is really expensive. They won't let you have different types of flautas in one order. The steak in the flautas is too big so when you bite into the flauta the whole chunk of meat comes out and you are left with a gross hollow thing. I ordered queso fundito, and it was a solid hard thing, not a dip, yet it came with chips? It was like solid, with the pumpkin flowers sandwiched in the middle. They didn't warn us that the prices had gone up when we ordered ahead on the phone. There's nowhere to park. It has a teeny tiny eating area. It's right on campus, so it's overly crowded all day. The good thing is if you order guacamole you get a TON of it.

<Content> Hard to find for out-of-towners. It's across the street from Dominos on Green St. Decently fast service - took just under 10 minutes to get 2 tacos and a deep fried quesadilla (say it like Napoleon Dynamite's grandma). The tacos are somewhat authentic w/ cilantro / lime / onion. They put mayonnaise (interesting) on under the meat on the tortilla, but it was hardly tasted. My big complaint is the tacos and quesadilla were extremely dry. They have two salsas - an orange and yellow colored salsa. The salsa tasted good on the chips, but not good enough or complimentary for the entree. The girl who took everyone's order was very nice so customer service was good. Lastly, the restaurant only seats 12-14 people (elbow to elbow) so eat out if you wish.  Ultimately I would not eat here again, but if you read other reviews and decide I'm off my rocker, take it to go and buy an extra bottle of water because your mouth will be dry after eating.

<Content> I lived in California and have visited Mexico several times. The Maize grill has the most authentic south of the border flavors I have ever encountered in the States. I had the torta and tried a regular taco, both with Carne asada. All I can say is that they were absolutely delicious. Can't wait to go back.Don't expect any ambiance, though. There are only about 12 - 15 counter seats available. The food makes up for it. And, show up early for lunch, because they have a tendency to fill up rather quickly.

<Content> Best Mexican in town, perhaps the best inexpensive Mexican I've had anywhere. Yes, it's cramped, parking can be difficult, including getting out at the corner -- but it's worth it. Chips + verde salsa (I think you have to ask for the verde) are great. Fish tacos are best in town. Love the chorizo burrito -- so good I'm willing to suffer the upset stomach. (The price I pay for any chorizo.)Always friendly even when it's a little chaotic in there. Wish they would expand and wouldn't mind having a margarita with my meal. Hoping.

I got a chicken burrito, while my husband got two tacos and a chicken quesadilla (the tacos and quesadilla were small-ish, but made a great meal together).Will definitely be back again! I think this may become a regular carry-out for us. Too small to go to with a group, but great as a grab-and-go meal.As for the parking - I recommend using the meters across the street behind Domino's. Waaaaay easier to get in and out of than the tiny parking lot by the restaurant.

You get 3 chalupas for 4.99 (ish). Other good things to get are tacos and tostadas. if you get a torta, get ready to bring home leftovers because that thing is huge!The meat here could use a bit of salt and pepper. also, don't bother to get the fancy steak taco or fish taco because they dont taste that great. otherwise, everything is delicious!

<Content> This is a VERY good mexican restaurant.  I've been meaning to come here for several months, but based on the reviews, I decided to wait when school was out and campustown would be empty.  The parking lot is SMALL.  I mean like, 6 parking spots maybe.... so either get their early or park on the street somewhere and walk on over.  The restaurant is a little hole in the wall ex-diner/donut shop.... seating is super-limited.... again, maybe like 10 seats.... so your best bet is to probably eat in your car or on the curb.  The prices are very reasonable.... you'll fill yourself up easily for $10.  I got three tacos -- al pastor, fish and a rib eye.  They were authentic -- cilantro and onions... corn tortillas.  I could've eaten about 6 of them easily. The rib eye was good, the al pastor was better and the fish was outstanding!  I got complimentary chips and salsas while I waited. They were good.... but not sure how fresh they were since they were already warming under the heat lamps when I sat down.  This is a GREAT Mexican restaurant.... but not sure if it's really worth venturing into campustown to MAYBE get a seat AND a parking spot.  You definitely don't want to be lugging around a baby in a baby carrier because they'll just wind up sitting next to you on the floor (limited space) --- I mean, like stretch your arms out to your side and that's probably the size of the dining space width-wise.  Don't even think about bringing a toddler here because again, they won't be able to sit still on the chairs for very long.  But if you're by yourself or with a small party, go for it!Other than that, there are other alternatives in town that are just as good (ok, no other place has fish tacos like these, but for other mexican fare, there are good alternatives) such as Taco Loco, the taco trucks (the Mas Amigos at Prospect and Bloomington, and whateveritscalled Taco Truck in the Springfield and County Fair Dr area).

<Content> Everything was tasty. The salsas are great, very fresh! We got our order to go, parking is VERY limited which was ok when it was a donut place (you're in and out) but maybe not so great for a restaurant.  Prices are very reasonable, filling food and friendly staff. My only real complaint is that the vegetarian options are kind of limited. Sure they list veggie as an option for most items, but don't order it thinking you're going to get a taco or sope or huarache with grilled veggies instead of meat. You'll basically get the item with NO MEAT, just the toppings listed, even though you pay the same price as one with meat. I'd love it if they added some grilled veggies so at least it seems like a vegetarian option instead of an afterthought.

<Content> Amazing New Mexican Restaurant!I hadn't heard about Maize, just saw it pop up on First and Green where during my 4 years here on campus I've seen many establishments come and simply disappear. Me and my roommate (all mexican) went to try it highly suspicious that any place around here could actually offer authentic mexican cuisine. Boy were we wrong. This place is great! It does everything right, taco, quesadillas, huaraches, and even tortas. It's the level of authenticity you might expect from a place like Nuevo Leon. I wish they just had more seating and were able to offer a dinner type atmosphere and menu. Great lunch and cheap dinner food. They are missing a lot of dinner items such as enchiladas, mole, or pozole. However, everything they do do, they do it right. Their salsas are great, their tortillas delicious. Everything has the perfect amount of grease. Seasoning could be better, but it's better that they under salt than over salt. . Definitely try this place out!

I got two items, both under $3 each, and they gave free chips and salsa (good and spicy salsa at that) with my order. Their chorizo is excellent and all the ingredients tasted really fresh. It's impressive seeing the waitstaff team go to work during rush hour, running with the speed, friendliness and efficiency of a championship McDonalds staff.

<Content> Awesome food. This little place just sprung up a few months ago, and it looks like it is here to stay (I sure hope so at least). Maize always seems like it is busy, so I decided to try it out. Great food. I like how the burritos are prefect sized - I can eat one without feeling stuffed (unlike a Chipotle burrito, not that that is bad though). Really friendly staff, and a small bag of Chips and salsa comes with every order. The inside is small though, so if you walk in and order, be prepared to wait a little (less than 10 mins though) in a small space!I used to be an El Charro fan, but since Maize moved in I haven't gone since... and I haven't really missed it either.Pros: Great food. Decent prices. Friendly staff. Chips and salsa with every order. Orders don't take long (I can call an order in and by the time I walk over it will be ready!)Cons: Small location, not a whole lot of room to wait around for your order or to sit down and eat. Really busy sometimes.

<Content> This place is good. I got a huarache with squash flowers the first time, and a chicken burrito the second. Both times the food was super fresh, and the base for the huarache was home-made I think. A friend mentioned that they forget to add salt...that might be what is missing? Also, I like really hot salsas and theirs are extremely mild. I would say the taco truck at Bradley and Prospect is my first favorite for Mexican food here, and Maize is my second favorite. Then maybe the Mexican grocery on Green is my third favorite.

<Content> BEST TACO PLACE ON CAMPUS. If they delivered, it would probably be the greatest thing to happen to the UIUC area. But in all seriousness, their meat is great, the tacos are always very well filled, and it comes with free chips.

<Content> Yes, it's very good food. Yes, they have lots of great choices. Yes, it is authentic mexican food in the middle of Illinois.But, it's always packed and they are continually raising their prices. It was once extremely cheap and I went there a lot. But now I prefer Huaraches Moroleon for better food, better prices, and a better atmosphere. Maize is still delicious though.

<Content> It's small and quaint, but it's so good! I get the veggie burrito and it's quite large but doesn't over fill me. They also give you tortillas and salsa with every purchase, pretty nice addition. The salsa is definitely on the spicy side but it's great. It doesn't take long to get your food either, very quick.

<Content> Only once in my life have I ever craved a resturants food all the time. Maize would be the resturant I am talking about. I absolutely love the food!! Every food item I've had has been amazing! So fresh and real! Haha. I come here all the time! The service is great as well. The servers are always friendly and kind. This place is small and the line is always out the door but it's so worth it!!!!!

<Content> Authentic and tasty, no question. Enjoyed a burrito con al pastor, which had that lively, slightly sweet flavor. It was excellent and plenty large. The salsa is clearly made in house and is also delicious (and comes with the meal, I might add). As good as Mexican gets in CU. Here's to hoping the steady volume of traffic I've noted driving by (and visiting the once) continues.

<Content> Tried Maize for the first time about a month ago and it was good. Tortillas are made fresh so that is amazing. They ribeye steak tacos are extremely tender and the fish tacos have excellent flavor. Wish the place had more sitting space though. Chicken tacos were a bit bland but the salsa verde adds great spice for them.

<Content> Okay, my credentials: I lived in LA for 5 years, which has probably the best Mexican food in America. My favorite taco place is Tacos El Gordo in San Diego, which has 559 (559!) yelp reviews and 4.5 stars; I raved about that place 3 years ago before it blew up. I like lengua, sesos, suadero, barbacoa, al pastor, asada, tripas, carnitas, and buche. I like tacos with pickled radishes and carrots served from trucks parked under LA overpasses late at night.Maize Mexican Grill is seriously legit. Hand rollled tortillas. Huitlacoche. Huaraches. Rib-eye tacos! The fish quesadilla is incredible: it's a hand rolled tortilla filled with cheese and fish, perfectly deep fried with a delicate crispy outside, a soft doughy tortilla inside.The atmosphere is awesome, too. At once bright and airy, and cozy too. Sit at the counter and you can't help but talk with Armando, the owner, and your fellow diners about the food coming out. It's more of a foodie community than just a restaurant.Pro-tip: if you have the time, when you get to order tell Armando that you're in his hands and you'll have whatever he decides to send out. Sit at the counter an be ready to be very happy and very full.

<Content> If you haven't been to Maize, the question is why? Fantastic food! Quesadillas, volcanes, tacos, tlacoyo, nachos - all so good! It is really mostly a carry out joint, so I don't fault them for limited space at all. Better to start out small, grow a reputation - than look for a big space to begin with.

<Content> If you have read my other reviews, you know that I would just about eat anywhere if the food was good. Yes, Maize is teeny-tiny and I even get grouchy trying to squeeze in but it is so worth it! The food is SO cheap and delicious! I am super picky when it comes to Mexican and I didn't even want to go when my boyfriend suggested it but I am glad we did. The fish tacos are my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE! Would definitely recommend to anyone!

<Content> Maize is just one of those start-ups you want to see do well and all for good reason. As soon as I step in, I walk into an extremely cramped space full of people(mostly college students). The interior was rather cheerful and clean. There was a strange buzz about the place with everyone either awaiting or devouring their food while engaged in happy conversation with their family and friends. Despite the shoddy exterior and sheer lack of seating pace, there place possess a warm and inviting feel. The food itself is VERY reasonably priced to start with, which to a college student like me is always a plus. The ingredients were fresh and you could easily tell that the food was made to order. My group was first served the complementary chips and salsa, and the freshness of the salsas just shone through. I ordered a vegetarian Torta Ahogada made spicy. I am a sucker for very spicy food, and my oh my was my palate for once was satisfied on this front. It was flavorful and very filling. All in all, Maize offers Mexican food in a less cliched and entirely authentic way. It offers not only freshness of ingredients, but also fantastic value. Of course, the place wasn't designed to ever give people a satisfactory seating experience, but the food more than makes up for it. An A+ from yours truly.

<Content> I don't understand why everyone is ranting and raving about this place. I went solely because of all the fantastic reviews, but I was incredibly disappointed! Is it absolutely terrible? No. Is it the best Mexican food out there? Not even close.I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 1 chicken taco. When I unwrapped my food, I was disappointed to see 3 puney little tacos. They look like tacos you'd order off of some sort of kids meal. However, I'll admit I was wrong about the sizing because they were incredibly filling! At first I didn't even think 3 would fill me, but just 2 and the chips and salsa they give you with every order left my stomach full.So maybe something is wrong with my taste buds, but these were the most bland tacos I've ever had. Probably one of the most bland things I've ever tasted period! I started with the carne asada tacos. Although it was loaded with meat, I could not taste the meat whatsoever. I felt like I was eating an onion and cilantro taco (the only other ingredients on them). Although the cilantro is very fresh and tasty and the onion gives it a good kick, I did not pay for a cilantro and onion on a tortilla...Then I thought maybe it was just the carne asada that isn't their expertise, so I moved on to the chicken taco. Just as bland! It's not even that the cilantro and onion are overpowering, the meat just has absolutely no flavor to is. I don't understand how meat can be that bland. Even unseasoned meat isn't that flavorless.The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I can't speak for everything on the menu. However, that being said, I don't plan on trying anything else on the menu. Sorry, but Maize isn't for me.

<Content> Really nice place. A real hidden gem. We decided to go out for some wine last night, and chose this place because it was so close to our home. We were pleasantly surprised! The atmosphere is great and the staff are very knowledgable and nice. I didn't eat, but plan on going back for the food!

<Content> I would say this is an okay liquor store. They seem to have a variety of wines & beer on hand. However, they lack a decent variety of hard liquor. Also, I find them to be quite expensive. I prefer Binnys.

<Content> Great place for wine and cheese! Friendly people, delicious assortment of cheeses, deli food and wines. The atmosphere is very casual as it is set in the center of a strip mall. This is a mix of wine/beer store and deli. There are several tables and a bar inside as well as tables out front on the patio. The menu is very extensive with a variety of wines, beers and spirits to choose from as well as soups, salads and sandwiches. The food was very good, presented well and reasonably priced. In the store area you will find a nice variety of wines and beers to take home with you.

<Content> I've been here several times and keep coming back for the delicious menu and wine selections. After tonight, I won't be returning. The service was awful. When I inquired about ordering dessert, the staff in the deli department rudely informed me that I can get a menu from my server.  A full hour before closing, the staff began mopping the floors, throwing garbage around, and making a lot of noise. We got the message loud and clear and won't be back.

<Content> Wow!! There are a lot of good reviews for this place. Maybe I am missing something. Went here for lunch today and ordered the special which was a caprese sandwich & broccoli cheese soup. They both tasted just fine. In fact I thought the sandwich was quite tasty. But I left hungry. That was the smallest sandwich I think I have ever had. It was about the size of one of those little finger sandwiches you get served on a platter by someone walking by at a party. 2 or 3 bites and it's over.The soup was good but again very small portion. The real kicker was the bill. $11.00 for a couple of bites. Friar Tuck has a better wine selection too.Not sure if I would go back for a second try.

I had it with the chicken tortilla soup, also very tasty, paired with the Kris Pinot Grigio. Pleasant, friendly, and knowledgeable staff. It was my first visit and I will definitely be back.

<Content> Wow.Sunsinger was a very pleasant surprise. I wasn't expecting much from a sandwich cafe in a wine store, but the food here was absolutely fabulous. The cheese experience was wonderfully presented and a great way to start off the evening. We had the two cheese plate and it was a perfect appetizer; four and it would've been a lovely meal.My husband raved about the beef and mushroom sandwich he ordered, and I couldn't have been happier with my gourmet grilled cheese. I adore sweet/savoy dishes, and the rich buttery challa, creamy melted cheeses, sweet fig jam and tangy apple slices were really a winning combination.We ordered the chocolate love cake for dessert, and it was a bit much for us. The cake was so rich that even splitting it, we were definitely pushing the envelope to finish it off. It was, however, delicious and a very small piece would have been perfect.The service was friendly and attentive and the cafe area had a very nice cozy feeling. We wandered around the store checking out the wine selection and cheese counter after our meal. Had I not just consumed enough cheese to sink a ship, I would have done some serious damage to my grocery budget! Dinner itself wasn't cheap considering it was sandwiches, but it was clear that the ingredients were top quality and well worth the price.

<Content> Sunsinger is definitely one of the treats of the CU area. It has a great atmosphere, delicious food and, overall, a friendly staff. I've been there many times since a friend turned me onto it and the food has always been delicious. The almond-crusted goat cheese salad is one of my favorite menu items. It has one of the best balsamic dressings I've ever tasted and the combination of almonds, warm goat cheese, dressing and the crunchy salad is perfect. Also try the grilled cheese with apple slices and fig jam inside. You'll be glad you did.I've had a few cheese plates and their selection of cheese spreads and have been impressed every time. When they have special selections of cheeses they are always well-selected and make for a fun lunch or dinner as they usually range from the more mild to the more adventurously pungent.If I have one complaint, it's that the service is slow. There is a very relaxed atmosphere in general there and as long as you leave yourself plenty of time you'll have an enjoyable time. I would not recommend going there if you're in a hurry though. They're staff seems fairly small no matter how busy they are and everything comes to your table at a leisurely pace. If you have an hour for lunch or are not on your way to a movie after dinner though, you should be fine.After you're done, be sure to check out the wine selection. The staff is incredibly helpful in selecting a good wine and will not judge you if you don't know a great deal about wines in general. I've went with a staff member's recommendation on a couple occasions and have yet to be disappointed.

<Content> Sun Singer is definitely a rare find in the area, especially when you're tired of the campus restaurants on Green St. I came here for to celebrate my friend's graduation and this place was divine. The layout is not exactly fitting for large groups and our party had to push several tables together, but the staff was very accommodating and the ambiance is great for conversation.The restaurant/cafe is inside a winery and is perfect for a casual lunch. They have a deli section with fine cheese and meats. I felt like I was transported to Europe and wish I could take a 3 hour lunch-break just to enjoy it all.... The first thing people told me to get was the LOBSTER BISQUE. And believe me, this is the best! It was so creamy, thick, and full of lobster flavor and goes well with any of their sandwiches. I got their grilled cheese supreme with 2 amazing cheeses (Danish Fontina & Fiscalini Cheddar), granny smith apples and fig jam on challah bread. You'd never think jam would ever go so well in a cheese sandwich, but it does! A half sandwich and cup of soup is $9.75.Their sandwiches some with some olives, fried vegetable crisps and mini pickles. I have yet to try the rest of their extensive menu but their food is well worth the price.

<Content> Sun Singer just warms my heart.Some people seem to balk at the idea of a fantastic eatery existing inside a wine shop, but it's really ideal--you should have no qualms about having wine with your early lunch, trying a few glasses, and walking out with your favorite bottle! The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the food is fantastic. It's the perfect place to grab a classy lunch.

<Content> I had heard that this place serves gourmet food. Unfortunately, it is in no ways trendy. It just seems like a cute place to have brunch.. and the crowd is a bit older. It's not really expensive.. but it's a little pricey for sandwiches. It's a little ways of a drive from campus or downtown.. but the food is good. Service is a little lacking. You have to flag down the waiter for menus, more water, etc.I tried their lobster bisque and thought it was pretty good. I also liked the smoked salmon-goat cheese sandwich. I tried my friend's reuben and thought it was AWESOME.It also seemed to have a good selection of international wines and other products (sodas, etc.). I personally think that Friar Tuck's is better though for buying alcohol.

<Content> I was pleasantly surprised when my friends brought me to this cute little place. Who'd have thought this cool, tiny wine bar and store would exist in a strip mall in Champaign, IL?Healthy pours from the bartender. And the menu, while limited, is perfect for nibbling, chatting and wine sipping. We split a couple of appetizers, with the cheese platter filled with our wonderfully stinky choices, the star.Nice selection of wines to purchase also.

<Content> Best top shelf liquor selection I think in champaign, with a nice variety of wine bottles and many, many shelves of imports and microbrews. The deli is great if you need a simple brie or some salmon spread, but doesn't have the selection that ye olde time meat and deli shoppe does for meats, or EuroMart for cheeses. Plan ahead if you need to visit the deli at the last minute for cheese for a party, it is sloooowwwwwwww and invariably takes longer than I think it's going to, causing me to be late.

<Content> I had no idea this place existed until very recently, and now I can't wait to come back to try all their different wines and menu items.True, the location leaves something to be desired, but I think it's worth the trip. Here, they have a wide variety of wines (so much so, that even my wine-savvy friend hadn't heard of several of their selections), and a surprisingly extensive menu for a deli-esque kitchen.We split a cheese plate and a hummus plate. The cheese plate was okay... the cheeses weren't overly exotic or special, but the black-bean hummus they had was really really good. The taste of it lingered in my mouth for quite some time afterwards.Our total bill came out to around $60, but that also included.... let's seee...... 6 glasses of wine?Not somewhere I would come everyday, but a nice treat every once in awhile. They have outdoor seating as well.The other half of Sunsinger was basically a cellar where they carried a wide variety of wines, liquors, etc. For the most part, I think these wines were priced a little higher than one would typically find elsewhere, but I'm not wine connoisseur, so don't quote me on that.If you have the opportunity, give Sunsinger a try.

<Content> I want to give you 4 stars, sun singer... But the service is painfully slow, especially with so many waiters standing around idly (why are you texting at work?). Fix that and I'll give the 4th star back. Nonetheless, my greek salad today was wonderful. The greens were perfect, the onions were sliced ever-so-thinly and the dressing was atypical in a good way for a greek salad (kind of pesto reminiscent.) They could have done a little better at designing the place into a dual-purpose venue. It looks too much like we're eating in a grocery store.

<Content> As you walk in, all the wine and spirits are displayed in front of you. As you turn to the left you will see a nice little bar with some tables and the deli behind that. The beer selection is towards the back of the wine. The bar/cafe area is really nice and welcoming. They have a good selection of all things. Extensive wine selection and a very good rotating beer selection. Good micro options like Bells, or some imports as well. You can sample wine, or pick a beer and they will chill that so you can enjoy for your meal. The food is really good. Lots of sandwiches, soups, salads, meat and cheese plates, as well as a few small plates. A good Reuben, Roast Beef, and any other sandwich that happens to be available. Sauteed mushrooms as a side is great. You can also get beer, wine, and any other deli options to go. I really like the place.

<Content> What a nice surprise!We went last night because it was warm and we wanted to sit outside and have a drink and some dinner. I got the 1/2 Bavarian Pretzel sandwich with ham and swiss with chicken enchilada soup and my husband got the Smoked Salmon Club (he called it a salmon BLT) with a side of beets. I was really happy with my choice. He REALLY liked his, too. We browsed in the store and they have such a wide selection! Their deli cheeses look amazing. The choices of beer is practically endless and they have some FINE liquors. I had a lot of fun browsing. The only downside to Sun Singer is that it is a bit pricey, but the quality is worth it.

<Content> Disappointed with our (1st) experience tonight. Came in to have a few drinks and maybe dinner. Wanted to sit at the bar, got the last two seats. The young man behind the bar was busy talking to a young woman, when finished he didn't welcome us, threw two menus down and walked away. He seemed very uninterested in waiting on us. I noticed everyone around us had nice full glasses of wine, ours were tiny. We got the hint, we left and don't plan on returning. I guess we didn't look like the regulars but were ready to spend a nice night and plenty of money.

<Content> Very tasty! I love this place and I don't even drink wine! I concur, order the gourmet grilled cheese! For standard lunch fare (Sandwiches, soups and salads), the prices are a little high. My husband's half Hot Dutch was TINY, dwarfed by his half Caesar salad. My half gourmet grilled cheese was a little on the small side but nearly as small and my cup of dill cucumber soup was just enough-and so refreshing! Our started of pretzel sticks seemed like they were frozen and reheated in the oven, not exactly homemade, but the dip that came with them was tasty.  Service was very good, attentive servers and friendly manager. I also love their deli counter, they make a mean cheese spread!

<Content> I got the grilled cheese w/ apple and figs that other reviewers raved about and the lobster bisque. The sweet and salty flavor of the sandwich was unique and definitely delicious! The bisque was very flavorful too. But I was definitely not pleased with the price or the portion size. I really want to give this place just 3 stars because they are so overpriced but then again so is everything else in C-U. People that live around here must be used to over paying on food to think these prices are reasonable.So I will give back one star because the service was pretty attentive (before it got busier in there) and the place was clean, cozy, and charming. I'd go back only because the food is good and because I'm starting to get used to the fact that restaurants in C-U really are more over-priced than anywhere else I've eaten in the world.

<Content> This is the deli that isn't.The food and wine are good, as described by other reviewers but the take-out food ordering system is among the most bizarre I've ever experienced. Apparently the restaurant and retail foods systems run on different computer systems, so to order prepared food to take out....you have to order in the restaurant or at the front counter, then go back to get your food and the "deli" staff (who speak poor English) have no idea about your order until it surfaces on their paper printout. I've been in restaurants, takeouts and delis everywhere and have never seen such poor coordination, even when orders are simply shouted.In a city that is overrun with restaurants and takeout places, you'd think that the owners could somehow get past this and create a real working deli - something the immediate area needs badly (the other sandwich shop in the mall is pretty poor). The lunch rush could be huge for the place, but apparently they're not interested in more business in a brutally competitive restaurant market.My two stars worth.

<Content> Very cool lunch place. I had the half sandwich and salad combo. I had the portobello mushroom sandwich and the goat cheese salad and they were very good. There were also cheese plate options that I would love to go back and try. This is also a good spot for gifts for wine lovers/people that entertain. There was outside seating and seating at the bar. My only gripe was that the service was a tad bit slow but it may have been because I was sitting at the bar. I can see how people may say the food is pricey but it is worth it for the better quality. The portobello sandwich was a good vegetarian option, and the grilled cheese sandwich also looks like a great option, I want to go back and try that also!

<Content> This review is late in coming. I went to Sun Singer not long after it opened. I ordered a platter of food that was supposed to feed four. There was barely enough to feed two. Then I ordered a bottle of wine off their menu. OFF THEIR MENU!! I did not bring my own and did not buy a special bottle off their shelf, but bought one off their menu and was charged a corkage fee. WHAT?!?! I "discussed" this with the manager and was told this was the policy. He was dismissive and arrogant about it, talking as if I knew nothing about the concept of a corkage fee. That was the first, last, and only time I ever set foot in that place.

<Content> This is my new favorite place. The wait staff (as well as wine clerks) are knowledgable and friendly. I was visiting the cafe this time and was pleasantly surprised at the reasonable prices. I ordered a "sunsinger cheese experience" for $7.99 (or maybe it was $6.99, I can't remember) which included 2 wonderful chunks of cheese (and a little knife to slice them), delicious fresh sliced bread, lots of fresh fruit including grapes, apples, dried cranberries and sugared, dried mango all beautifully presented on a big plate.  It was so lovely. And I ordered a nice glass of wine for $5.50. It was great and the waitress was "johnny on the spot" refilling my friends' water glasses and getting their orders. A great experience.

I can go there when I'm about to entertain my "wine friends" and get great wine that won't break the bank or I can ask for two buck chuck that won't embarrass me for my "I know nothing about wine" friends. The staff is really friendly and it's a good place to sit outside in jeans and a t-shirt without dealing with a downtown scene.

<Content> I found this place while searching for an alternative to all the chain restaurants in town (my mom was visiting and hates eating somewhere she can go to in Chicago). This is a unique-to-Champaign place for sure, so it seemed promising. In concept, the place is great. Cute little cafe/ wine bar in conjunction with a wine and cheese and specialty food shop. They need to do a better job in the cafe area, in my opinion. The menu was interesting, but the prices were a little high.  When our food arrived, we noticed right away how small the portion sizes were. I actually appreciate when restaurants have reasonable portion sizes, but these were on the small side of reasonable. Neither of us felt full at the end of the meal, and for the price of the meal, we felt a little ripped off.  The food was good, we had the chicken salad sandwich and the gourmet grilled cheese.

This seems to be the place for the countryclub set to lunch, so they are expensive, but if you are going to pay for a gourmet sandwich, this place is 1000 times better than the competition. The Grilled Cheese Supreme on crisp buttery challah bread is sublime and the Roasted Turkey & Bacon is accented by rosemary aioli and crisp greens. Top notch ingredients!

<Content> Nice choice in SW Champaign. Part wine store, part deli, part cafe, kind of tries to be all things. That's where I ding it a star. The food has always been good, and they have lots of choices of salads, sandwiches, and even dessert - maybe too many. I like going to the deli and having them create me a plate of cheeses and meats to sample. The ambiance is pleasant and somewhat upscale. This is in an affluent residential part of town, and the clientele mostly reflects that. I think the mark-up on their retail wines is high - I would go to Corkscrew or Friar Tuck instead. Nice place to unwind though, with outdoor seating too, and I never felt pushed to leave.

I couldn't not get enough of it, so I ended up ordering another half of a sandwich. :)) Also, the service was wonderful, despite a few mistakes. The man that was making our food behind the cheese display was so kind and attentive to everything we needed.

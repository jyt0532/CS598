<Content> My girlfriend and I were walking around campus looking for a sandwich/cafe type place to get lunch and chose The Bread Company. Walking in the door we were charmed by the atmosphere: mismatched chairs, chalkboard menus, and the wonderful smell of fresh bread! After a quick run through the menu I hastily chose the tuna salad on multigrain and my girlfriend had the mixed salad (pears, walnuts, blue cheese, raspberry vinaigrette). After ordering (and not yet paying), we were told to stand in an alternate line where we were to pay for our lunch. This is the only part of the restaurant that I didn't enjoy. We ended up standing in line for 10 minutes (with only one person in front of us!) waiting for the cashier to take our money. It's not that he was busy working, which would be completely understandable, he was walking around seemingly looking for people to talk to instead of working the register.Besides the payment debacle, we enjoyed the food immensely and will definitely be returning to try out dinner and brunch - hopefully by then the payment process will be a bit more streamlined ;)UPDATE:I've been to dinner here twice and LOVED it both times. The bread company is now part of my regular restaurant rotation.

<Content> Bread Company has been around for 15+ years, it is the kind of local place that visitors to town are likely to miss, but it's worth checking out especially for those who like to avoid chain restaurants.I recently stopped by for Sunday brunch--something I almost skipped because their website didn't list a brunch menu (I thought I knew most of the brunches in town and didn't know Bread Company was an option until today).The service was friendly, but like a lot of local restaurants, the timing was not-so-great and generally felt inexperienced.The waiter offered slow-drip pour-over coffee, but called the coffee "blends" when they were actually single varietals (sorry, coffee nerd here). The Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, though, was aromatic and worth the extra charge (though it's reasonable to expect that the menu had listed the price or the waiter had known it after I asked: no luck on either).I waited much too long to place my order after sitting (and it was not busy). But the prosciutto and gruyere omelet (which I added spinach to with no problem) that arrived vastly exceeded expectations: it was flavorful, chock full of good ingredients and not overcooked. The pan-fried potatoes were spiced but not overly salty (though I sent them back when they arrived with a huge dollop of unmentioned sour-cream--ew).The baked bread was sourdough and crusty and a perfect accompaniment. Nice job, Bread Company. Great food. Lacking final star only because my waiter could have used some some further training on the menu and service timing.

<Content> Can't get your burger rare...they weren't sure about the meat today. Staff was so quick to clean our table they took food we weren't finished with twice! Couldn't get the waitresses attention to pay our bill. Salmon salad was great..shrimp pasta fab..why no grated cheese or ground pepper?

<Content> I popped in here once for lunch last summer, on the recommendation of my nutrition professor. Our chat on carbs and training for races and triathlons led to "you HAVE to go to the Bread Company!" Though this overly subtle carb stop doesn't have a sign (anymore?) on its exterior, it can be identified by the variety of wine bottles lining the window sills. There's a variety of sandwiches for the lunch hour, but I hit the Bread Company tonight, and my, do they swank it up for dinner.Dim lights, plentiful menu of pasta-pizza-sandwich options, and extensive specials list, including tapas. Who knew? I had the roast beef sandwich, served atop roasted potatoes and a light salad. I think all of the sammies are served up open faced, so open your mouth, and get ready for a carbolicious meal.

<Content> This is probably the best restaurant in Urbana. First of all, they bake their own bread and fresh pastries are available for breakfast everyday. My favorite is the cheese (gruyere) croissant because it is so flaky. It literally melts in my mouth. My coworker called it high class junk food but I call this good stuff. Sometimes, when I felt lazy to go to lunch, I would just buy a loaf of bread and eat that with a cup of coffee. The zufte or zoft, which is a Swiss specialty bread is amazing. It is fresh and out of the oven by 11am during school days. I have not seen other places in the area that sell zufte but the bread is really worth trying. Oh, if you have cravings for day old bread, they sell them at half price.They also have a wonderful selection for dinner. Daily specials change quite often but they have their regular dinner menu. I usually go with the daily special. This place also has fondue, both cheese and chocolate. I had both and I have to say that they are pretty stingy with their cheese and chocolate. I had barely enough to cover the fruit or bread. Do expect $12-$17 for entrees and about $10 for fondue. By the way, they sell cheeses too in the day.They have pretty good service but the people do not seem to smile a lot during the day, especially the owner. They should be happy because of the wonderful smell of fresh bread. The decor is a little European and has a fireplace at the corner which makes the place extra cozy in the evening. Anyhows, this place is highly recommended. I am sure you'll love it.

<Content> SO and I came here for our anniversary: The Good:-We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation and were welcomed and seated promptly.-Atmosphere was nice but not stuffy, eclectic collection of chairs gave it a more casual feel-Waitress was extremely friendly and treated us well, happily accommodated us-The Fried Goat Cheese with honey and strawberries was dreamy, so delicious. -Basil Tomato Fondue was delicious, "it tastes like pizza".-Chocolate fondue uses dark chocolate, which makes it rich and not too sweet-Portions were generous, especially with the goat cheese appetizer, there was so much goat cheese that we ran out of bread! Our waitress happily accommodated us and brought more warm bread.The Bad:-Nothing!Overall:Fantastic! Food and atmosphere was great! Would love to come again.

<Content> Three star food with two star prices - not to be confused with the two dollar sign symbols on yelp :p So yes, I mean it's extremely overpricedDecent for an "special occasion" and students tend to be impressed with this place just because it's actually a nice sit-down restaurant and not on Green Street, but it needs to get over itself a little if it wants to thrive in Chambana. Fondue is really the only reason to check this place out since I don't know of anything else nearby that has this for dessert, but food is just average. Oh and their sangria is on point, too. But really, what college kid is drinking sangria? If they are, they are probably used to their wine out of a box

<Content> I just had a group event here, and the Bread Company was great! They were really flexible with the menu, and only charged $35 for the private room. Plus, the tip was not added on automatically (which is a pet-peeve of many people I know.)The pizzas were great, thin-crusts. Very unique topping combinations! I have never seen roasted carrots on a pizza before, but it was surprisingly tasty. The best pizza was one with spinach.Also, their salads were awesome! I am pretty fussy about eating salad at restaurants, but these were among the best.The servers were friendly and the manager (Chris?) was especially helpful with making arrangements for the group event. I would recommend this place if you need a private area for your group!

<Content> Lovely experience here tonight! Service was wonderful and was complimented by getting to meet the owner, Lindsey. She and her husband took it over from his family recently (not exactly sure when) to continue the family tradition. Food was tasty - I had pesto pasta and husband had garlic pizza plus a French onion soup and bruschetta. Atmosphere was quite nice on the patio and we enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine that was reasonably priced. We had the privilege of talking with Lindsay further and learning about their takeover after getting a summary from the menus which include an overview on key individuals in the history of Bread company, including Lindsay and the original owner, her mother in law.

<Content> Something has got to be done about the abominable service at The Bread Company.. It's such a shame because their food is not bad, but the service is so badly below standard, I decided I am simply never coming back here.There is one particular worker with tattoos on his arm who is very insolent towards customers, raising his voice at them for asking questions.For months, I've ordered a grilled sandwich to pick up for lunch time, and the result is totally random. If the owner (tall bald guy) is there when you call, chances are you'll get a good sandwich with the potatoes and salad on the side, but if he's not there, watch out: there's no telling what you'll get. Sometimes they include potatoes and salad with the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they slice the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the sandwich is available since the grill is on, and other times it's not even available since they turn off the grill in the middle of the day to save money randomly.Today for example, I went to pick up my grilled sandwich to-go, and was surprised to see that on this occasion there were no potatoes and salad included, even though two weeks ago I ordered around the same time and they were included. So I asked the short-haired lady in front of me behind the register, "are there potatoes and salad?" (pointing at the sandwich) and she stared directly at my eyes without answering! So I repeated the question and she stood there completely quiet, staring at me without answering, when the tattooed arm punk butted in our conversation, cocked his head at me and yelled, "didn't we go over this already?!" Don't bother coming here. Unless the owner fires some of the incompetent and insolent flunkies buzzing behind the counter soon, this place needs to go out of business ASAP.

<Content> It had been a couple years since I last went to The Bread Company, and since today was a beautiful day to sit outside and eat a sandwich, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a go. I got a half portobello sandwich, half strawberry salad - a delightful combination, and everything tasted fresh. (I'm gonna have to figure out how to make that sandwich on my own!) My boyfriend's salmon burger was pretty good, but served on bread and not a bun, which was kind of odd. I also had the English Orange iced tea, which was refreshing and a little sweet without being cloying.Our waitress had a major stick up her ass, though, which is why I'm downgrading them a star. Bread Co., why must you hire rude people? More often than not, the people working here are gruff and disdainful of the customers. I get it, you're too cool to smile. I'm not asking for a hug at the end of the meal, all I'm looking for is service without a scowl.

<Content> If it's raining, and you're on campus, Bread Co. is the best place ever o eat a pretentious sandwich while watching the precipitation assault the pavement from the safety of your cozy table.The sandwiches are top-notch, and filling. I've had the turkey pesto, and the portobello. Both are delicious. Double frosted brownies make you hate your lack of will power, but are suitably delicious as well. Service is a bit aloof, but reliable. Like all other elitist jerks out there, look for me savoring my expensive sandwich while reading a pretentious theorist. I've got street cred to maintain.

<Content> Bread Company is across the street from my office on campus, and while I used to pick up a sandwich combo for lunch, I've since given up because the combo is so uneven. And now with the combo prices hiked up higher than ever --$10 for a half sandwich and cup of Campbell's soup?-- I probably won't be back for lunch either. The grilled cheese sandwich is substantial and generally yummy (though hot sandwiches are served during a very small time frame), but the salads and soups are serviceable to dire. I'm never very excited to eat their salads, which consist of slightly wilting greens, but the soups taste like they came from an industrial-sized Campbell's soup can. Murky chicken noodle broth and sparse chicken and noodle? No thanks. At lunch with a friend, her very basic soup held vegetables suspiciously similar to that recognizably uniform shape and size of the bagged frozen sort. It definitely does not seem as if the soups are freshly made, at all. The lunch hasn't ever made me want to come to dinner for fear of similarly cut corners.

<Content> Went here once, in 2007, on a first date with a hot chick I met while in college. Almost six years later...she's my wife. Yea, guess I'd say that's enough for 5 stars. Thanks Bread Company *brofist*Do I remember much about the food?...No. The only thing I remember was feeling underwhelmed by the bread. I mean, if the place is called "Bread Company" I expect the bread to be something special, you know what I mean? Whatever, I guess by now I'm over it.Bottom line: took my crush here on a first date, ended up getting a second date...a third...and yea, eventually I even got laid. Thumbs up, would recommend.

<Content> An OK , but not great, place to grab a sandwich for lunch. Not surprisingly, they do have really good bread. Horrible destination for dinner.The lines are long and the sandwiches are pretty decent at lunch time, and it's certainly worth a try if you've never been here before.I've been in twice for dinner and was very disappointed both times. The first time I was here, the place was dead and there were maybe 2 other tables seated. The other time was for Valentine's Day (stupid, I know), and the place was packed and seriously overbooked since they apparently had given reservations to everyone who called and asked for them.Both times, the service was very slow and the staff was *extremely* rude, to include elbowing and pushing customers during the crowded V-Day fiasco, which I found inexcusable. The quality of the food was poor, the servings small, and the prices high. There were definitely some interesting looking recipes on the menu, but the quality of the ingredients was very substandard so nothing tasted very good at all. Produce is not fresh and all the fruits and vegetables I had on both occasions were over or under ripe and clearly prepackaged. The first time I was in there, about 3 different entrees were ordered before we picked something they weren't out of.I only went back the second time for V-Day because I wanted to try out the chocolate fondue. In addition to being waaaaaaaay overbooked, they were understaffed and had a limited V-Day menu that was basically just 6 or so items from the regular menu with the already high prices about doubled. Portions were so unbelievably small that even after spending $75+ on dinner, we had to go to LaBamba's afterward because my husband was still really hungry. Seriously, he was served a piece of lamb that was roughly the size of a sliver dollar and probably could've been eaten in one bite with a little effort. Total time in restaurant was in the 3 hour range due to the poor service and inability to seat in accordance with reservations. The chocolate fondue was served in a beat up saucepan that had something crusted all over the outside of it. Chocolate itself was actually pretty good, but the amount of stuff they gave us to dip in it was staggeringly small and the vast majority of it consisted of bananas and apples that were overripe to the point they couldn't be eaten. Although it was fondue for two, there was only one piece each of the more high quality dipping items (cookie, strawberry, etc.)I will certianly not be back for dinner and probably not for lunch either since there are a variety of other lunch places in town that are just as good or better that are easier to get to, Paradiso in particular.

<Content> I don't understand why the lunch and dinner here are so different. Is there a different owner for each meal? Lunch is self-service, no-frills sandwiches and soups. In a word: plain. Dinner is table service and can be good. But they emphasize a gimmicky fondue service and the main dishes can be hit-and-miss. The pizzas are solid. Meat can be over or undercooked. Order seafood... watch out!Why is it called the "Bread Company"? They do appear to make their own bread, but it isn't that good. Seems misleading. Kind of like their "specials" list. (It doesn't change.)

<Content> Excellent food, nice atmosphere. They seem to have upped their menu in the last year, which is fine although makes for a higher bill at the end. I'm usually happy to bring the kids along... the place has a very euro-bistro feeling.A minor gripe, however, is that the last few times we've gone the service has been less than stellar. It seems they like to hire hip girls who aren't so interested in helping a family have a nice meal.

<Content> Came to this place completely by accident. We meant to go somewhere else and saw this place and decided it was too neat looking so we had to give it a try. The 4 star rating is heavily based on the food. The actual condition of the restaurant is more like 3 stars. It has nice ambiance but if you start looking too closely, you'll notice it is very deteriorated. Perhaps, why they dimmed the lights so much! :pThe food was delicious. All except for the bread, weirdly enough. It wasn't warm or fresh and was served with butter packets, not oil. Oh well. We ordered the goat cheese bruschetta and one of their pizzas. Can't remember which, but it was pesto based, not sauce. I loved it. The dough was doughy, not crispy. For dessert, we had a mildly spicy carrot cake (which also had goat cheese! Yum!) My husband and I split all 3 items and it was enough for dinner and leftovers to bring home.

<Content> This is a real gem. Probably the most consistently good food in CU. Lunch brings nice grilled or deli-type sandwiches, and there are veg options. Dinner is much more interesting with pastas, nice fish and meat entree specials, and wonderful thin crust pizzas, baked in hot ovens. Desserts are also very good. I am less into fondue (exceot for chocolate dessert fondue), but this is the place to go for that. The ambiance is eclectic and European. Families will feel welcome. Service can be a little ragged, sometimes a student group of 15 or large party will materialize, and that can have a rather deleterious effect on service when there are only 2 servers on the floor, which is often the case at night. Even so, I have never had a meal here that was less than very good, and many that were excellent.

<Content> When our department has to entertain guest speakers or job candidates, The Bread Company always becomes the default dinner/lunch location. Embarrassingly, I've heard some job candidates comment that they were taken here for 3 different meals during their visit! My department is probably at fault for their lack of imagination when choosing restaurants, but The Bread Company offers some benefits that elevate it to a top pick for business-casual university diners:(1) Location. For people who have short lunch periods and need to be within walking distance of campus, this restaurant's location is unbeatable. (And since it's next door to an Espresso Royale, you can grab a coffee after your meal, if desired.)(2) Atmosphere. Most college restaurants resemble a McDonald's Playroom for adolescents: neon walls and heavy-duty plastic furniture, with underlying scents of urine and vomit. While The Bread Company does have a hint of grunge, it also invokes a strong sense of urban, artistic chic. There are real paintings on the wall (not poster prints). At night, they bring out white tablecloth and mood lighting.(3) Price. I think the prices are reasonable depending on who you ask. This place IS pricey when compared to most campus restaurants, where students are always trying to squeeze their dollars. Lunch generally runs around $7 to $10, which is not unreasonable when entertaining guests. (And still comparable/cheaper than what you can get at Timpone's, the other "nice" restaurant in the area.)All of the food is fairly conservative, with obvious combinations of flavors (brie + portobello, turkey + pesto, etc.). I think this is also a reason that it ranks highly among options for guests; you will find nothing offensive here in terms of food (but also nothing exciting). The presentation tends to be elegant and you can tell that most of the ingredients are of good quality.For lunch, I always go with the egg salad, which is creamy, well-seasoned, and always satiates my craving for egg goodness. In the early evening, sometimes I stop by for a beer and appetizer with friends. The cheese selection is quite good (you'll find Stilton, Gouda, Manchego, etc.), and the beers are all microbrews (if you're into that kind of thing). Dinner selections include fondue, pastas, pizzas, and some specialties, but the prices are on par with more interesting restaurants in downtown Champaign/Urbana.In terms of baked goods, I am quite fond of ordering my sandwiches here with sourdough or rye bread. Yum! At most places with a baking reputation, I always find myself enticed by the sweet buns and cookies, but I almost never find myself tempted by the ones at The Bread Company. Their treats always look colorless and hardened, as if they were made by an angry grandma.Overall, I'd recommend this to people who like simple, light food. If you are cheap and don't care about indie street cred, you could probably get the same food at Panera.

<Content> I've been to The Bread Company several times now, and left disappointed most of those times. Their food isn't horrible or anything (except for their gazpacho, which is by far the worst I've had), but it's definitely overpriced and bland. The only item on their menu that's worth mention is the grilled roast beef sandwich ($9.50 after tax) -- fried roast beef cold cuts, sauteed onions, and gruyere cheese. Just about anything else I've had there, including their soups, was just bland and cost waaaaay more than it should. Also, their pesto tastes nothing like basil, more like parsley puree - I definitely don't recommend getting anything that has it. Finally, you'd think that a restaurant named the Bread Company would have good bread on their sandwiches...

Was a little bit on the pricey side for a sandwich, but I think that if you go during lunch you'll get a better value for money. My friend ended up getting a pasta dish which was pretty decent however like I mentioned it was pretty expensive. Would be nice for a special occasion.

<Content> The Bread Company is a restaurant with many different faces. By day they have a varieties of soups and sandwiches, as well as baked goods. Sandwiches are on luscious slices of thick bread and the soups come with crunchy salads. I especially like the grilled sandwiches, which are laced with creamy butter and lightly browned meat. Portions are quite large and one sandwich could probably be shared easily among two adults. Sometimes I forget this and end up making two meals out of one sandwich.During lunch hours this place is quite crowded, but by late afternoon it becomes serene. Soft green light floods in from the skylight and during the winter you can sit the fire with a baguette and a glass of wine. As regards to the review that mentioned rudeness about adding protein to things, I've heard that happen many times during lunch and now they let you have your meat, but charge a lot for it. They have this bizarre policy because they "don't want people making their own sandwiches with the bread that comes with the entree." Nice one. At night it becomes more formal, with candlelight, fondue, and more upscale entrees. The balsamic potatoes that come with the entrees are perfect. I like the fondue, but it's a little too much for me...even the small pot can be shared by two. Last time I was there I tried the tapas and the yellowfin tuna and the lamb were delicious, but I was less than enthusiastic about the duck mousse, which had a bland sickly sweet flavor. The greens that came with the tapas were also pretty inexcusable. When I go to a good restaurant I expect more than just some shredded romaine, especially when field greens are still in season. The new small desserts are also not so great. The chocolate mousse was good, but the bread pudding was just some bread soaked in eggs and sugar.

<Content> My husband and I, along with two other couples, decided to celebrate the end of the semester tonight by going out. After *much* debate, we ended up at The Bread Company. As a former music major, this was one of my usual haunts, but the rest of them hadn' t been there quite as frequently. (Lunch, by the way, is excellent; they have excellent sandwiches and salads).The specialty, of course, is the fondue, which is magnifique. My only gripe is that portion sizes tend to vary widely from time to time, as does the selection of vegetables that comes with your meal. The combination of cheeses, though, is great, and the bread and potatoes are wonderful.Tonight, though, I had one of their specials, which was good, but was actually my *third* choice of menu items. They were out of the fettucine with salmon AND out of the chicken pizza. Now, I don't pretend to understand the inner workings of the restaurant business, but it really irritates me when they run out of something. To me, that just smacks of poor planning. Do they not have a kitchen? Can they not make more? If not, then can they not provide accurate estimates of how much of each food item to make, so they won't run out? I don't know, but it just seems like when you go someplace, you should be able to look at the menu with confidence.Anyway, the beef fondue I had was very good, and one of my dinner companions adored her trout. She said it was the most moist fish she had eaten in quite some time, and she is a fish lover. Her husband, a reasonably picky eater, devoured his pancetta pizza with no complaints, as did another friend with his salmon. I thought the portion sizes of some of the meals were pretty small, especially given the price. Still, it's good food, and worth the money, especially when you consider it's not that expensive. Service was pretty good, although a little slow, particularly since they weren't that busy tonight. My guess is she just had a hard day.We love the Bread Company and will continue to visit, but probably just for the fondue. We know they'll have it, and we know it's good. Thanks for a fun evening!

<Content> I've been to the Bread Company at least 6 times over the past three years all separated by months. The only reason I continue to go back has got to be because I forget about how sub-standard their food is. And today I decided to finally put my disappointment on the internet.This review was spurred by a visit today to get coffee and a pastry. I ordered an americano that was obviously made with poor quality espresso, and perhaps by someone with little knowledge of what an americano should be. It was too watery, but maybe that is my taste. I also had what they dared to call a chocolate croissant. It could have been made days ago. Instead of being light and fluffy, it was dense and doughy and filled with chocolate chips that were never fully melted so they maintained their chip structure. I was less than impressed. But this seems to be the way things go at the Bread Company.As I mentioned earlier, I have been going to the Bread Company for quite a few years (having been at the U of I as a student since 2008), and their menu has yet to change. At all. This sort of stagnancy is worrisome and really speaks to the lack of effort that the chef and/or owner put into this business.On a recent dinner visit I got the chocolate fondue which came with possibly pre-made cinnamon bread slices, strawberries, and a plethora of apples and pears. I suppose the apples and pears were in season (it was November when I went), but I don't see how apples work with chocolate. I've had their pizza many times, and I cannot deny that they do a good crust...but I just don't get the pizza that comes with a mountain of salad on top. It is just too much and overwhelms the pizza that really should be the star of the dish.Overall the Bread Company is uninspired and very tired. This is reflected in their dusty, unchanging interior, their menus, and the often impolite, lackluster performances of the staff.

<Content> I ate dinner at The Bread Company for the first time last night prior to attending a play at the Krannert Center. I had read many reviews of the restaurant and entered with some trepidation. My party had a reservation for ten people at 6:00pm and I was in the last group to arrive - a little late. The other guests were already enjoying a drink while waiting.The service and food were both outstanding. Our server, Nick, was prompt, polite, and knowledgeable. Everyone's food looked so good. I ordered a vegan pasta dish with vegetables, which was excellent. My wife had one of the unique pizzas and enjoyed it thoroughly. I noticed that at the end of dinner all in our party had left nothing on their plates. We were all full happy campers! Only one member ordered dessert - chocolate mousse. He said it was great.We were finished with a leisurely dinner and had our bill paid with more than enough time to stroll down the block to see our play. The only negatives were bread that was a bit burnt due to what appeared to be a hot spot in the oven and the meals which were delivered to the table one or two at a time, which seemed a bit odd. However, the overall experience was enjoyed by everyone, making for an excellent prelude to the play. I will definitely come here again.

<Content> Bread Company has a selection of great ingredients that results in good food, but the service is terribly inconsistent. I have a bunch of stories about this, but here's the two that contrast most significantly: (1) When I came for afternoon drinks with my writing group, it was quiet and we received great, not-too-hands-on service: a nice mixture of noticing when we might want more drinks and letting us alone.(2) A few weeks ago, my husband and I went with a party of 6 for dinner 1 1/2 hours before a show, told them our schedule, and were assured that we should have plenty of time. Cool -- except that the whole thing turned out to be kind of a disaster. We all ordered at the same time, and there seemed to be plenty of servers for a full room at dinner, but our meals arrived over the course of a half-hour (the pasta came after the steak, hmm). Fresh and tasty dinners, yes, but it was impossible to wait and eat together, and everyone was antsy due to the delays. In the end, we finished 20 minutes after our preferred time and our waitress did not seem particularly motivated to help the situation along or even really apologize.So: Good food, decent wine, but the service is a gamble. Try it, but go on a quiet weeknight -- definitely not for a Krannert opening or right before another occasion.

<Content> I've been here a couple of times with a group of people at an off time. The experiences I've had were fine. The service was good, food is decent, a little bit more than what I would like to spend for the amount that I get, but is a solid change to add in your repertoire of restaurants for lunch.

<Content> Super romantic spot on a cold winter night. The fondue is excellent. Staff is intelligent and attentive. The crowd is the highly educated, super liberal type. Refreshing sometimes.

<Content> Fondue dinner at the Bread Company is probably the top restaurant experience I miss from Urbana, IL (caveat: this review is a bit out of date). At the time you could get a very decent swiss cheese fondue with good bread, some roasted garlic for an appetizer, and two glasses of house red for just over $30--a princely sum for a starving college student, but compared with the trendy $100 fondue restaurants in the SF Bay Area, a steal. The dinnertime atmosphere was also great: quiet, romantic, dimly but warmly lit.They also had fantastic checkerboard shortbread cookies. I've been hard pressed to find better anywhere else.Lunch sandwiches and other baked goods were both decent, but the five stars are for the fondue date memories.

<Content> When I went to school at U of I, I came here all the time during lunch to grab a roast beef or ham sandwich on their freshly baked swiss bread. Sometimes I went for the half soup/half sandwich, or half salad/half sandwich to get more variety in my diet. The food here is like comfort food for me, since I grew up in Urbana and my mother used to buy these sandwiches and their large loaves of freshly baked Zu00fcpfe for my brothers and me. The service at The Bread Company has always been fast and efficient, and the employees were always very cool and made no mistakes taking my order and making me a really good sandwich. I've been here a few times for dinner with my friends. The atmosphere totally changes in the evening for dinner, as they lay out white tablecloths, dim the lights and allow the romantic glow of candles set the mood. Their pizza is delicious and filling, and their tapas come in pretty big portions. This is a cute and cozy place for anyone on a date or double date, or out to celebrate a special occasion.I've ordered take out from them a few times when I've had last minute dinner party pot lucks to attend and didn't have time to cook. One time, I picked up a strawberry walnut mixed green salad, which was perfect, and also a french baguette with a side of baked garlic bulbs drizzled with olive oil. It was worth every dollar.I love this place!

<Content> If all of the profs on campus hide out in a certain place, you know it has to be good. I always hear mixed reviews about this place from my friends, but I'm going to go ahead and give it a 4. This is my new favorite lunch place on campus (for when you have time). The sandwiches may be $1-2 more but are killer compared to other on-campus options. The grilled sandwiches may be a little buttery on the crust for some, but it's perfect for me. Last time that I went I got the grilled turkey sandwich which comes with caramelized onions and cheese.Dinner options include fondue and pretty good pizza. They also have some good bottles of wine on the list, I've ordered a bottle twice and been happy with what I got. You might have to talk to one of the chefs if you want wine opinions since our server didn't seem to know much.Really good atmosphere and decor, it's casual/fancy enough for pretty much anything, and it's right next to Krannert if you need an after-show dinner.

<Content> Food is very solid. Although many other reviews have had a problem with service. I have been there dozens of times for lunch and dinner and never been disappointed. It's a family type place so don't expect the service to be like that in a chain restaurant.If you want solid food with a continental flair can't go wrong here

<Content> The bread co is owned by a Swiss family, their children own Cafe Luna in Champaign, also worth a visit. I love coming here to relax and talk with my mom when we make lunch dates. I celebrated special occasions here as well growing up. They sure knew how to accommodate a large group of 14 year old girls on my birthday years ago!Recommendations-Roast beef sandwich-Portabella, brie, and raspberry jam sandwich-Zu00fcpfe bread, it's comparable to challah bread.-Cheese fondue - beautiful beautiful gruyere fondue. As good as Switzerland-Meat fondue - the broth is lovely, it's served with three different sauces and fresh baguette.-Chocolate fondue - Melted swiss chocolate, fresh fruit in season, cookies, pound cake.I love this place. It is one of my favorites.

<Content> Every time I've been here, the food has been fine. But I don't come here often. It's not that I'm not on campus, or don't like the food (see the first sentence.) Spouse and I tend to avoid The Bread Company because it's almost always dirty and the service is wildly inconsistent. Tables aren't bussed, there is dust on the paintings, trays of dirty glasses sit out, the walls aren't cleaned. Heck, the pizza/empanada place around the corner is often cleaner than The Bread Company. Sometimes the wait staff is really nice. Sometimes they are brats. Devil or angel, they rarely know what they are doing. Want more coffee? The nice waiter will forget; the brat glare at you. Either way, you don't get the coffee. For a long time, The Bread Company was one of a handful of restaurants that served decent food in C-U. Even after C-U got more restaurants, there still was a long period of time when there was no other decent restaurant in the area. The result seems to be that the Bread Company has gotten used to figuring it has a captive audience and so does not have to work for customers. That attitude seems to permeate everything it does. The trouble is that the food isn't worth the attitude, at least not to spouse and I.I wish The Bread Company was a more pleasant, better run restaurant.

<Content> The Bread Company is one of my favorite restaurants, and is one of the things I miss most about U of I. I ate here frequently as a student and as an alumna I make sure to stop in every time I return to campus. The atmosphere of the restaurant makes me feel like I'm taken away from the stress of every day life. They have a fireplace in the corner and white lights strung up to make it feel romantic, but it is modernized with the art that they have on the walls. My husband and I usually share an order of cheese fondue and a gourmet pizza. The Bread Company offers a nice selection of wine and beer, including wine by the carafe. I can't forget to mention their selection of fresh baked cookies. The sables and chocolate macaroons are delicious. Great atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable prices - I love this place!

<Content> Wow. I wouldn't be surprised if this became one of my favorite lunch spots on campus. I went today and really liked it. I got one of their grilled sandwiches: turkey pesto, and it came with gruyere cheese and grilled red onions... delicious. It's not extremely cheap: I paid around $7.50 (but the cold sandwiches go for $5.50 or so), so there definitely are cheaper options to eat around there, but the food is good so it's worth it in my opinion. On top of that, I like the place and the atmosphere. They also sell bread (as you might guess!), and have wine by the glass. I can't wait to check it out for dinner.

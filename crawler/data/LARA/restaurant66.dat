<Content> Above average Korean food on the salty/spicy side. I guess everybody has a different experience, but I always thought that the service was pretty decent. The owner asks me how I'm doing in school and etc... Even though I've only seem him a few times.

<Content> I was finally able to give this place a shot today and I was very disappointed. Prior to eating here, I knew from other reviews that the service wasn't the best, but I wanted to go to the restraunt without letting this info skew my opinion. However, I got there and received some of the worst service I've ever gotten. Right off the bat, the young man at the counter was not welcoming at all - it seemed like he didn't want to be working. I asked him if there were any sections for lunch specials in the menu because I saw "lunch special!" written on one of the laminated pictures, and he rudely replied with "no lunch specials." Okay then...I paid with my debit card and they do it with an iPad, making you pay tip while they're pointing the iPad at you, which I thought was a bit rude. I gave 15% but I shouldn't have because this guy was extremely rude and they don't serve you at all. It's all self service. Also, I asked for no onions in general for my tofu soup, but when I received my food, there were green onions on top. So I said I had asked for no onions and the guy that took my order first gave me attitude saying "that's not onions, you didnt tell me no green onions, you just said onions." And I replied with, "they're still onions... I said no onions, I thought that was very clear." And he replied with "you need to specify what you want." And I just shrugged it off and was already annoyed with him at this point where I just took the food because I didn't want anymore trouble, and the woman who gave me my food asked the guy as I was leaving if I had an onion allergy where he replied to her saying I had none, I just didn't like them. This was so rude because he doesn't know me (what if I did have allergies) nor was it necessary for him to make it my fault that I didn't specify what kind of onions I didn't want, when I didn't know there were two different types of onions in the soup. So needless to say, I probably won't be returning to the restraunt unless I'm having a huge craving for their mediocre korean food.

<Content> I was really disappointed. Went in there, got my ramen and was enjoying the first 2 bites until I saw a RAW EGG IN THERE and the egg white was still clear (I don't know about other people, but I don't ever eat eggs raw....)! Told someone about my issue and they simply took my bowl, cooked the ramen again, didn't even bother to get a clean bowl, splashed the ramen in there (the soup got all over the outside of the bowl) and took it back to me. Nothing looked appealing about my food...

<Content> So you saw all the pictures people posted right? Looks good right? Mmm U can taste it already in your mouth...the hot spicey tofu soup, the bulgogi lunch combo...mmmmI saw small little teeth marks on my kimchee that most likely was from a rat getting into the tub of kimchee in the back kitchen somewhere. These marks were not a half eaten kimchee cube from a human. I know what a half eaten kimchee cube looks like from a human. This was a pest.I spit my food out. Got up and left. Didn't even bother reracking the food tray.Never came back during my two year prison sentence in grad school.

<Content> I don't understand how people can come here and only order one thing.I loveee getting their bulgogi and seafood soondooboo!SO GOOD. I can never find anywhere that has better bugogi than here. I think it's because they actually use a grill for the meat. AMAZING.On top of that, the owner is SO nice. Always has a smile and is asking how my day is.Can't go wrong with this place :)

<Content> i was craving for some cold noodle today (its a hot summer day!) so here i am. The noodle was okay, not enough sauce so its a little bit on the bland side. On the menu the description says it include beef and sashimi, but as you can see on the picture i took, there is no such ingredient! (okay i dont care about sashimi cuz im not too much a seafood person, but where the hell is my beef?!) for almost 10 bucks before tax i got a bunch of steam noodle, a sad little pouched egg and some pickled radish?..... maybe not again...

<Content> S/O to any vegetarians/vegans reading this: WARNING, this is where the very concept of vegetarianism/veganism goes to die. At Goodfellas, the Korean ah-joo-mah simply gives you that standard, condescending "uggggh" glare and reluctantly brings out a meatless dish that they probably spat in. That's what I'm more accustomed to when eating at Korean restaurants. Is THAT too much to ask? Here, the muscly bro that works the kitchen just flat out says "No. Bibim bap needs beef." Whatever BRO. Have fun busing trays from your dive cafeteria beef factory, beefy McGee. I can't say what the rest of the non-veggie items are like. A friend who went there with me was "unimpressed." TWO STARS FOR YOU.

<Content> Other reviewers have described Woori Jib as a "hole in the wall." It definitely is. The place is functional; it caters to the lunchtime campus crowd. The food isn't cheap (around $10-12 for an average lunch), but the place fills up. Most meals include a second bowl of rice for free and a side of kimchi (radish and cabbage style), which is good. The food is not elegant or fancy -- it is tasty, basic, and homestyle. To me, this is comfort food, the kind you might make yourself at home if you had the time (and tended toward Korean comforts). The beef bulgogi comes out sizzling, with thin sliced and seared white onions. It has been marinated in a sweet soy sauce and this sweetness caramelizes nicely upon grilling. The portion is big and filling.The manduguk has a chicken broth base, and includes loads of mild beef dumplings. As is traditional onions, scallions, and eggs flavor the broth with a little dash of dried kelp on top.The dolsot bibimbap is yummy. The meat was not marinated beef in strips, as I've had in the past, but ground beef (that was just okay). The mixed, steamed veggies and the chili paste with fried egg on top were delicious mixed with the crisped rice on the bottom. All that was finished just right.Just to clarify what I've seen in other reviews, when you go in, your whole table orders at the counter together and is given a shared number. When someone from your table has an order up, your number is called. It may be called several times, at different points. If you order a dish that takes longer to prepare than others (like the manduguk) you will find other numbers higher than your own being called. These folks aren't cutting in line -- it's just part of the kitchen's process.Once you pick up your order, you will stop by a side table near the counter to get your silverware / chopsticks, etc. When you have finished, you return to the front on the other side with your tray, which you place in a cafeteria cart. Efficient, no frills, but relatively fast even on busy days (15-20 minutes to get served something cooked up fresh to order).BTW, I've also heard some reviewers writing in to say they feel they've been treated differently because they weren't Korean. I am a Caucasian American and have felt well treated at Woori Jib. Yes, the cashier has assumed on occasion that I and the white people in line behind me are eating together because, well, white. But that's no big deal. The owner thanks me after every stop and the cashiers have helped me to explore and order.

<Content> Probably has the best ddukboki on campus! It's made in such a way that you still want to pay for it 'cause even though you can make your own version at home, their version is that much better. Also, they get the rice right every time (it's the simple things that add up).

<Content> I really liked this place. I was a little surprised to find this downtown but it was good. Very big portions, so I recommend sharing it with your friends. The bi bim bap came in a huge silver bowl, not a black cast iron pan, so the rice wasn't cooked crispy but the flavor was good and the hot sauce wasn't too spicy for the non-Korean (or none spicy) eater. The kalibi had a good flavor but the meat on the bones was a little tough. It came together with a bowl of rice and some hot soup and of course a side dish of kimchi. You order at the front counter and wait for them to call your name. It's self service and self busing afterwards. Quick, low key and easy to eat. Good place for a tasty meal.

<Content> When I feel like sitting down to eat some Korean, Woori Jib is where I end up. If you get the barbeque chicken, beef, pork (I always get chicken), you get free refills on everything except for the bbq'd meat, and they have soup you can help yourself to as well. It all comes out to around $8.Overall, I would say I like this place slightly more than Dorca's as I would come here to sit down and eat with friends as well as carry out.Delicious, quick, filling, good location, awesome.

<Content> The lure of unlimited rice refills & homemade banchan made Woori Jib our first stop in Champaign after hauling all of our belongings halfway across the country & subsisting off of salads from Costco. Woori Jib clearly caters to the hungry college crowd - you place your order up front, pick up utensils, water, & free soup to the right, then snag a table & wait until your order is called out. After you're done with your meal, you do have to bus your own table a la Ikea style. While Woori Jib is a little pricier than the other local Korean restaurants, it also ranks as one of the highest ones. The meat-centric dishes will knock you back $10-$12, but you will certainly get what you paid for. I've had the divinely tender Galbi Ribs & the charred Pork Belly, while the boyfriend is loyal to the Spicy Pork Bulgogi (the only downside is that half the dish was onions). The portion sizes are quite generous, where you can certainly split an entree to feed 2 people with the add cost of $2 for unlimited rice for both, or pack up the other half for some tasty leftovers!*They accept Visa & Mastercard along with cash.

The only downside about coming here is that you leave smelling like food, so this isn't exactly the place to wear your Sunday's best, lol. Dishes I've had and loved:-galbi (short ribs)-bibimbap-bulgogi-soon du bu with beef-chicken stir fry (new fav: i get it in a spicy sauce and it comes with veggies and rice cake)

<Content> For a college campus Korean restaurant, I think Woori Jib is the most genuine and the best in the area. It doesn't say much, but it counts.I've enjoyed the galbi, cold buckwheat noodles, bibimbap, and many more dishes. They aren't bad. For a college student, it might be slightly pricey, but they've got to satisfy their cravings too, right?Just don't compare Woori Jib to the Korean restaurants you grew up going to or to the Korean restaurants outside of Champaign, and you'll be content.

<Content> In general, most Champaign area Korean restaurants start out with bad service. This place is no different. After ordering your food, it typically takes 10-15 minutes to get your food, and it doesn't always come out in the same order as you ordered. On top of that, you'll often have other people that cut into line and get the same food that you ordered before they did.On this occasion, I ordered duk mandu guk and it came with soggy seaweed in it. For the price of $10, it was a bit more expensive than other Korean restaurants in the area. In addition, it didn't taste spectacular to any degree. The only consolation was that it came in such a big bowl that I could take a little bit home for a leftover meal.Another dish that is pretty popular is their BBQ bulgogi. It usually comes with a special sauce but it really depends on the day to figure out whether it's good or not. Sometimes, it's under cooked. Other times, it's over cooked and burnt. They also use about a 50% onion to 50% meat ratio so it seems like you are paying for a lot of onions and not a whole lot of meat.The seating is usually crammed so during rush hours, it's hard to find a seat. There is very little room to back your seat out as seats are pretty much back to back.

I also love the chicken stir fry. It is so well seasoned and has the perfect ratio of meat to veggies. They are not stingy. I have yet to try a dish on their menu that I do not enjoy. I will continue to keep going here time and time again.

While the dishes are slightly overpriced, I feel that the serving portions are quite large. Woori Jib had a very unique dipping sauce, which I felt complimented my Bulgogi. In addition to your meal, you receive tiny dishes of kimchi and other vegetables. Overall, I do recommend this place to anyone in Champaign interested in getting Korean food.

Portions are extremely generous, with free soup to start your meal, you cant go wrong. unlimited kimchi and rice and sauce also comes with every meal so if you are very hungry you can always refill on that stuff. Definitely a place I've been to multitude of times

I've been in Champaign for a long time now and have gone to Woori Jib religiously and its always delicious. If you don't know what to get, start with the BBQ beef or Kalbi (BBQ beef short rib). Go see for yourself, you won't be disappointed!!!

The rice was also cooked with too much water, making it mushy. I couldn't finish it. Either this dish just isn't good here, or there are consistency problems. Either way, last time I come here.

They have unlimited soup (jigae?) and hot/cold water to make tea with if you want to don't miss that.If you're more adventurous try a Jigae (korean stew) or Dolcet Bibim Bop. If you're lame then get Bulgoki like everyone else :-p

<Content> It took me awhile to try all the Korean restaurants on campus, and I'm sorry to say that this is my least favorite out of the many to choose from, I mean it's okay but I've had better. At first glance the place is a little small and has a very casual setting. There aren't many servers on hand, and it was not too busy when my party went in. Now if you've been reading my reviews, I never judge a restaurant solely on experience, cause it's all about the food. I didn't mind the small size because it reminded me a family-style, close knit style of eating with friends and family. The food was decent but not the best I've had. I ordered the spicy pork and got some tofu soup on the side. When the food came out, the portion size was not as big as other restaurants like Ari-rang or Bwon and did not have much flavor to it. It was kinda bland and not as spicy as I would've like it. Now I remembered one of my friends telling me you could get umlimited soup, so I went to the little station they had set up and it was seaweed soup. The problem with it was that it tasted like water and no flavor at all, so besides it being unlimited, one bowl was enough for me. Everything else was pretty good, the ban chan was good and I enjoyed the free refills on everything, and tofu soup portions were actually of good size. Overall, a pretty decent place, but I've had better Korean food on campus (and off-campus at Bwon) and would recommend trying those places first.

They use really good meat for their spicy barbeque and it's delivered smoking hot to your table with bowls of kimchi and other Korean specialties. Some dishes might seem a little pricey, but most can easily feed two people

Suggestions:- Chicken Noodle Soup- soondubu jjigae (with galbi) - Stir fry (very big portions)- Galbi (taste amazing but portion size have gotten signif smaller)- Duk buk gi (they might have changed up the recipe a bit cuz i looked different now)- CALL AHEAD and place ur order ot avoid the long wait.- GRAB A TABLE the minute you step in that place because they'll get pretty packed around meal time- they are closed on Sunday so keep that in mind. - Oh and you can ask for second bowl of rice- ps. they got rid of the soup thing they put outside now.. but it didn't taste good anyways

<Content> This is not Korean food. It's not even mediocre Korean food. It is just a bad restaurant.My boyfriend and I went here and I ordered the Kalbi. I paid $12.00 and was stunned when it came out. My meat was mostly fat and bones, and there was not even one serving of meat. The soybean soup was simply gritty and tasted like it came from a cheap pre-made mix. They only gave me two pieces of kakdugi and three meagre slices of kimchi. Most Korean restaurants, for $12.00 you get five of six banchan (side dishes). If you want to really experience Korean food, go to Good Fellas. For slightly more, you get the full meal and refills on banchan. And they definitely don't charge you $12.00 for bones and fat.

<Content> I've given this another chance... I have to update my review from two stars to one star... an (almost $10) SEAFOOD AND TOFU soup cannot have barely three pieces of tofu, some red pepper paste, lots of salt, lots of water and (I kid you not!) ONLY ONE MUSSEL inside. Yeah, that's their "seafood soup" now - no shrimp, no anything else... just ONE SINGLE LOUSY MUSSEL. Greedy owner, incompetent Mexican cook (the Korean owner used to be a decent chef, but now he slacks off and lets the Mexican guy do all the cooking), racist attitude. Yes, both Woori-Jib and B-Won seem to have this "what are you doing here? You can't possible know what Holy Korean Food is about" attitude if you're not Korean yourself. I haven't seen similar racism and superior attitudes in Chinese restaurants for example, not even in Japanese restaurants, which offer, on the average, food which is a lot more refined. Shame on you, Woori Jib!

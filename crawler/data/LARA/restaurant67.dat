<Content> "Surprisingly good Italian food for the area."Ordered the Fritto Misto as an appetizer. A great starter with Shrimp, Calamari and Scallops. Our table had the 2010 San Silvestro Dolcetto Monferrato Anselmo bottle of wine with our meal. Per the advice of the waiter, ordered the Pork's Lover's pizza as my main course. Good meaty personal pizza, large in size. Had Creme Brulee topped with fruit for dessert. Daily specials offered, generally better than the menu. Open for lunch as well.

<Content> The food wasn't memorable, but the service was.Our waitress had no idea what she was talking about and seemed abrasive and rude! Unfriendliness aside, she didn't even do her job very well.It's expensive, and just based on service alone, I wouldn't go back.

<Content> I was in Urbana alone on business and wanted to dine at a nice restaurant within walking distance of the Illini Union where I was staying. The restaurant had a nice ambiance and the wait staff was professional. I ordered the halibut with brussels sprouts and proscuitto. The lemon beurre blanc sauce served with the fish was divine. The white wine I had was also very good. I was too full for dessert but wanted to try the lemon tart so I ordered it to go. I figured I could have it later while I worked in my hotel room. I was surprised when I got my bill and saw that I was charged .50 for the container b/c I asked for the tart to go. It's not a big deal but after paying over 60.00 for my meal (for one), this left a negative impression. I've gotten dessert to go at other restaurants of all different price ranges and have never been charged for a container. I wonder if I had eaten part of the tart at the restaurant and then asked for the rest to go if they would have still charged me the .50. Again, not a big deal but this changed my impression of Timpone's from being an upscale restaurant to a fine restaurant wanna-be.

<Content> "Three raviolis in my dish?! This better be the appetizer portion!!"My experiences with TImpone's are fairly inconsistent. Food is not bad tasting in any way, but I always leave just a little dissatisfied. Portions are incredibly small and well, if you wanna be "that kind of place"...you should move out of Champaign. It's fine for a date, business dinner, something of that sorts, but definitely not the kind of place I'd keep coming back to.

<Content> I think this may be the best restaurant near the U of I. Standard Italian food, but some wonderful improvisations in addition. I don't know where they get their seafood, but the swordfish is the best I've ever had. Also pastas, steaks, and great vegetables - they are committed to organic ingredients. Spend a few hours and taste a few appetizers before dinner. Reasonably comprehensive wine list and full bar. Cordial service, but they keep it leisurely, so let them know if you've got a curtain later. The owner comes around to make sure you feel well cared-for.Note: they serve lunch M-F from 11:30 until 3. Dinner begins at 5 p.m.

<Content> I think this place is great.. probably the best Italian you can get in town and so much better than the Great Impasta or Biaggi's. The service can be a hit or miss.. and yes, the stuff on the menu can be pricey.. but it's well worth it. Great date place! Try one of their goat cheese pizzas (it's not like Papa John's at all), specials (especially if it's steak or anything with foie gras), and creme brulee. I'm not crazy about the tiramisu.. I think it's a bit too alcoholic.The best thing about it is that it's on campus.. so even students can go there on a school night.

<Content> First time coming here with a bunch of friends. Many of us ordered the Fettuccine with Salmon Pasta, which was horrible. Not a single one of us thought it was decent. I had a difficult time choking it down after a whole hour of picking at it. Service was pretty good, although the food was not that great for the price you pay. The portion sizes are very small. The beef tenderloin was way above its price range for the amount you get and there's better out there. Overall, my experience was pretty bad...The creme brulee was the only thing that was worth praising there, although it is a tad too sweet for many of us.

<Content> I feel that this could be a perfectly good restaurant but every time I go there they just miss it. So if you want an expensive meal that just misses tasting good, go here.I had a perfectly good burger that had apparently been sitting too long before the waiter brought it out: the bottom bun had turned to soggy mush. So close!I tried a tomato bisque with goat cheese lumps in it that had a lot of potential but there were so many goat cheese lumps that the balance was all wrong. When you order a tomato bisque it should taste like tomato, I reckon. Almost!I had a fancy-pants mushroom and sausage pizza. Each ingredient seemed good by itself, but as a whole it had a taste I would describe as "many strong clashing cheeses." Nearly there!

<Content> This place survives because it is on campus, and very conveniently located. it is also the only restaurant within striking distance of the university that serves wine and has cloth napkins, which means that it is full of administrators and professors. The food is not at all good, but it has no competition if you need to take adults out to a semi-decent restaurant you can walk to from campus. You should definitely avoid anything involving duck as a topping, because it basically comes out looking and tasting exactly like pastrami from Schnuck's. If you like that, ignore what I wrote.

<Content> For two years I walked past the singularly unimpressive facade of Timpone's with its dated looking sign, convinced that such a place could only continue to remain open because it was obviously a front for some illegal racketeering scheme or other sinister enterprise.Then I went for lunch.I am still not entirely convinced that there is not a vicious syndicate running the location, but I was pleasantly surprised by my experience. Well-made salads, great food options, and wonderfully arrayed. I ended the entire adventure with a lovely dessert and coffee and emerged mildly regretful for having judged Timpone's so harshly.However, if there's a raid one day I wouldn't be surprised. ;)

<Content> I went here last night for my birthday dinner, and I was extremely happy with the entire experience. The biggest plus for me, aside from the food that is, was the waitstaff. All of the servers were very friendly and professional, and I could tell they all looked out for each other. Case in point, I noticed some lint on one of my glasses of wine, and before I could even say anything, one of the other waiters saw me studying the glass and quickly came over and offered to replace it.Speaking of wine, the selection was great, but I was unfortunately relegated to the limited "wine by the glass" menu since I was the only red wine drinker at my table. Even so, the selection of wine by the glass was well-rounded and pretty solid, and our waiter's wine recommendations were spot on. Now, for the food!Bread and olive oil is complimentary, of course, and very tasty (so simple...but so good!). For starters, we ordered the crab cakes as well as a spring salad with walnuts and gorgonzola, both of which were very good. For my entree, I had the roast duck, which came with fingerling potatoes, red cabbage, spring vegetables. The entire dish was fantastic. Moist duck, perfectly cooked vegetables, and a wonderful sauce that had blueberries in it. A simple dish done very, very well.In all, Timpone's is a great place for a gourmet meal at a pretty decent price. They have a nice selection of veg-friendly dishes, too (not vegan, however). I can't recommend this place enough. Give it a try!

<Content> I don't usually go out for Italian food because Italian food is easy to make. I make pasta at least once a week. Why pay $15+ per person for the pleasure?But I was taken out to Timpone's for lunch for my birthday. I'd been especially hesitant about Timpone's when thinking about trying Italian food here...mostly because their logo is so yuck and tired looking. Yes, I do judge a book by its cover. I was not more impressed when we entered the building, as the restaurant looked like an old timey lounge or shabby hotel lobby.My experience was proof of why it's wrong to judge books by their covers (though I'll still continue to do so). Timpone's offers a pretty extensive and moderately priced lunch menu, ranging from salads, to pasta, to individual pizzas, to entrees. Most items were between $8-12. AND all of the menu seemed relatively innovative. For instance, they offer a pizza that has broccoli, shrimp, and goat cheese. You know you want that. I had meatloaf (!!! who even has that on a menu?! excitement!) that came sliced, wrapped in thick bacon, on a fluffy bed of creamily dreamy mashed potatoes. There was just the right amount of tasty mushroom gravy and crisp-tender green beans scattered throughout. Holy hell. It was so fantastic. My dining companion had grilled shrimp with a less-mushy guacamole on top of polenta. See? Tasty and innovative. Even better, we got the last table in the restaurant, but the waitress AND the food both came promptly. Awesome.

<Content> It's kind of funny how you go through your college years with a certain perspective on cost. Back in my day, anything over 5 bucks for a meal was expensive. I never went to Bread Company or to Timpone's until after I came back to visit my now wife.But now? I'm freaking rich, bitches. I can order what I want, where I want. That's right. 12 bucks for a plate of awesome pasta with bolognese sauce? Why yes, I can afford that. I actually have a paycheck that isn't from wiping tables or undergraduate research!The times I've been to Timpone's has always been impressive. My most recent visit, however, made me appreciate this place all the more. I can't say that I've had a better pasta with bolognese sauce. Sure, it's a seemingly absurdly simple dish, but everything about the thing was just right.The wife got a fried oyster and spinach salad that was extremely delicious as well. I kept meaning to ask what sort of oysters they were, because you don't typically see consistently small oysters like that. Alas, the mother-in-law has since moved away from the Champaign/Urbana area so our visits will be fewer and farther in between. I'll have to make it a point to visit this place whenever we aren't stuffed on pokey stix...

<Content> I took my Dad here when he was visiting. I was expecting it to be expensive, but also to be a solid dining experience. Sure it is one of the few very nice restaurants on campus, but from now on I will go off campus to eat nice meals. The food was okay. The dishes were pretty small for the price.Worst of all was the service. It took forever to get anything done and while the waittress was very nice, it was unpleasant. Also, it was too loud for my Dad and I to talk which was our main intention. Lastly, this was in the winter and there was a huge draft whenever anybody entered the restaurant that forced us to put our jackets on.

<Content> Three people on a Wednesday night. Sat downstairs, which is like eating in the foyer. One glass of wine, two personal pizzas, bowl of pasta and 3 salads equaled a tab of $60 before tip. The pizza is great, but the total experience was meh. This restaurant ought to have a lower priced menu for the folks sitting downstairs and getting food dished out by the bartender, and a higher priced menu would be fair for folks sitting upstairs enjoying the white tablecloth experience.I'll go again, but a $7/three-ounce glass of wine ought to be enjoyed upstairs, and was simply incongruous for the casual meal-in-the-doorway we had.

<Content> This is one of the very early fine-dining restaurants in CU. Picture a midwestern take on a NYC restaurant, circa 1980's (though a little later 80's now since they did some updating). The menu, though printed daily, doesn't stray far - pasta, some fish options, sometimes steak, risotto. Service varies, and unfortunately there is a lot of server turnover. I have eaten here many times b/c it is close to areas of the University in which I work. At one point this was a bit of the "make the scene" place, and it is convenient for pre- or post-concert dining at Krannert. Nevertheless, many other places have come along since this one, and while I would say it's in the top handful of places in town, it is no longer at the top. I would also recommend lunch over dinner...very similar menus, and I tend to get better lunch service.

<Content> This is a tale of two experiences. My husband would vote his meal as a three, where I am sticking with a two. To be fair, he is much better at understanding flavor dynamics on paper than I am, which is probably why we ended up with two different experiences.This review is split into two parts: the ambiance and service aspect, followed by the food review. My husband and I agree, though, that two stars are definitely warranted for the former portion.There are three important items to note before entering Timpones. The first is that the decor is absolutely ridiculous; reminiscent of a Miami night club circa 1984. The second thing is that the wait staff do not seem to know what's going on, which can perhaps be attributed to the third thing. The manager yells at their wait staff in front of all patrons, which I can only assume makes the wait staff SUPER NERVOUS. Of course, I am generalizing based on one experience, and yet it seems other Yelpers share similar sentiments.Of course, the above items relate strictly to ambiance and service. Important, but not the end-all, be-all of a meal, so let us move on.We started off with a goat cheese and arugula salad. On paper, this was an exciting start to this meal! But when it came out? A total disappointment. It is seldom, even when a meal is not good, that I think, "this was shallow/vacuous/trite/vapid" and yet that is exactly what it tasted like.For dinner, my husband ordered a hearty stew with an interesting citrus, chocolate, and red meat dynamic. He enjoyed it, and rated it a three. I had the spinach tagliatelle that was underwhelming at best. There was very little flavor, but tons of cream. I thought the texture was nice, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. No dessert--we had tried enough.I am not sure if we will be going back here. I promise that there are restaurants in Urbana-Champaign that are WAY better. Perhaps they do not cost as much, or have as gaudy of interiors, but... they taste good. And I'm not so sure that the same can be said of Timpones.

<Content> Tjis place is out of the price range for most college kids and I feel the food is very average. Which would be fine if I wasn't paying extra for average food. I got taken here twice for a focus group for my major and since it was free I cant complain. But there's no way I would pay full price here.I'm a heavy eater. And by heavy eater I mean I normally throw down to or three normal entrees at regular restaurants.these portions do not fill the average person though. Its not a bad restaurant but its not great either.

<Content> Timpone's is a very nice restaurant, particularly at dinnertime. My boyfriend and I went here for a nice post-valentine's day weekend dinner (we knew it wouldn't be too busy this weekend, so we opted to do our v-day dinner this weekend instead.) When we walked in, the door and sign were very old-looking, but in a charming way, so that was promising.The first floor is a little more laid-back, but they say you can go to the upper floor if we'd like, so we opted for that. It was very nicely decorated with sculptures, paintings, and plants. The other diners were dressed casually, but still nice, if that makes sense. Like, jeans with a button-up or nice sweater. It was quite nice up there and the service was lovely. I ordered the veal and it was absolutely delicious, and the perfect portion size; however, it was not the perfect portion size for the price. For a $29 entree, I expected a little more on the plate, or for the price to be lower for the same amount. None the less, the food was delicious and so was my boyfriend's. We ended up sharing the creme bru00fblee for dessert and it was very good.Overall, the staff was very attentive and helpful. Although the atmosphere was slightly intimidating, it still had a nice, cozy, fancy-restaurant feel, and I wouldn't mind going again.TLDR: It's a nice place with good food and service, but expect to shell out some dough.

Needless to say, I'll never eat there again.Not only is the food bad, the owner is an absolute horror. I haven't dealt with him personally but he's got a very bad reputation. I talked with several people who worked here and they said he was just horrible. I'm amazed that they are still in business.

<Content> I don't comment unless it's mindblowing or horrid...If you're looking for "italian" go to olive garden or some crap place like that. Timpone's has a seasonal menu, diverse offerings, and expertly prepared foods. I don't think Timpone's bills itself as an "Italian restaurante" Okay, pasta is on the menu too, but is that all it takes to be pigeonholed about being Italian? Or the name?Yes, the decor is bad. But the food transcends...Far & above, it is the best place to dine in Champaign/ Urbana.Timpone's offers the freshest, most expertly prepared cuisine that I am aware of, and, for the quality, it is under-priced.

<Content> Every time I've gone to the Canopy Club to see some raucous rock show, I've always wondered if folks at Timpone's were being disturbed by wailing guitars and so forth.Still no answer on this but I have found that it's somewhere I'll want to be coming back to. Well, I ordered the papardelle with the bolognese. Being a bolognese snob (and believing very sincerely that the best bolognese I've had was made by yours truly), I have to say it was certainly up to my standards. In addition, I had a slice of my neighbor's margherita pizza which was also tasty. I've not been to any other Italian restaurants in town, but this is Chicago-quality stuff right here. While it's a little on the expensive side, it is finer dining. It's not somewhere I'd expect to go every day for lunch but it would be nice for special occasions, dates, etc.

<Content> Having gone to Timpone's for the first time for dinner with Sean Astin and the rest of the IUB Enriching Programs committee, I thought my lunch experience here would disappoint. The bar is on the ground floor and we got seating on the first floor. We ordered a Margarita pizza, two 8oz hamburgers (one with avocado one with cheese), and I ordered a Tagliatelle with Chicken Breast, Prosciutto, Peas, Tomato Cream, Basil, Romano. I've had the pizza here before and it's not bad but the pasta I had today was pretty good. The portions were pretty small though- it could just be that I'm comparing it with other campus eateries, when this is on a whole nother level. This is the first time I've ever been here for lunch and I have to say that I'm impressed. I had a great time.I strongly recommend the Burgers here -they're cooked to perfection and priced just right. This is a classy place so make sure you wait to be seated, even for lunch! My only regret is that I didn't explore their beverage selection...

<Content> I'm rather surprised at the reviews here. This place is expensive, and the portions are smaller, but that's how high-class dining works. If you want big portions (and often I do, so I understand the desire), go to Nyro's and get a triple gyro plate. The food is superb, and the waitstaff is excellent. The interior is very cozy and lodge-like (upstairs, anyway). Also, I typically don't like gourmet pizzas (I'm a blue-collar pizza kind of guy) but they really have some excellent pizzas here.On busy college weekends (like parents' weekend or whatever they call it) it's tough to get a reservation here. It's also the place that visiting scholars are often brought to be dined. The food will not disappoint.

<Content> The atmosphere: The downstairs bar area is small and cheap looking. The dining room is dated and screams "cheap 1980's supper club" - not at all romantic! The restaurant was filled with retirement-age couples/parties about to head to a Krannert performance on the Wednesday evening that we went. This past week, we went to Timpone's to celebrate my birthday. We started off sharing the "Fritto Misto" appetizr, described as "Calamari, Gulf Shrimp, Scallops, Red Onion, and Zucchini." When the dish arrived, it was nothing but a pile of glorified onion rings. There were only three pieces of calamari (small tentacles), 3 shrimp (which were small, and clearly of the phosphate-pumped Asian variety, and a scattered few wet calico scallops...95% of the "Fritto Misto" was red onion. I feel as though by listing the seafood first, that indicates that the bulk will be seafood, or at the very least, there will be an even distribution of the components. Not wanting to be a "difficult customer", I chalked it up to just a "bad batch." That being said, the recipe was a straight copy of Judy Rodgers' dish in the Zuni Cafe (San Francisco) cookbook, and I could have made it at home...However, when I received my entree, "Sea Scallops with a Dijon Beurre Blanc on a bed of celery root puree"... I was furious. There were 5 scallops, each approximately the size of a quarter (no exaggeration) and only seared on one side. The mound of puree could not have been more than 1/2 cup (and didn't even taste good). My husband ordered "Chianti-Braised Shortribs with Homemade Gnocchi" - which came with fewer than 10 small gnocchi. Worst of all, the food tasted bad; the beurre blanc was so sweet it was like Creme Anglaise with Dijon and I could have done a better braise at home easily. I know that times are tough, and that food costs are supposed to be ~30% of the final restaurant price- but I felt completely gouged. I'm happy to pay for a delicious meal and I do not expect large portions. I travel pretty frequently to Chicago and DC- I know what good food costs and what "normal" portion sizes are at "fine dining" restaurants. I did not want to make a scene because I didn't want my husband to feel bad for picking the restaurant. The only reason this place could possibly stay in business is because of its proximity to campus/the Krannert Center for Performing Arts or because most people have very low expectations due to the lack of "Fine Dining" in the C-U area.Our server was very attentive and great, but the food was so bad (even with the small portions, we didn't finish our food and didn't want to take the leftovers home!). We will not be returning.

<Content> Timpone's is a solid restaurant. The ingredients are fresh, and the menu changes often enough to keep things interesting. I would say that the food is overpriced, but it's hard to get "nice" food directly on campus, so you pay a premium for convenience I guess. I've been here a good number of times over the years, and every time was an enjoyable trip, except once. I took someone here on a date, and we were seated in an area where the lights weren't working and the speakers were broken. I'm guessing they figured they could just put students there and get away with it. I complained (the restaurant wasn't near full and I had placed a reservation), they were nice about it and moved us and the rest of the dinner went very well. The decor leaves something to be desired, but otherwise a solid restaurant, with decent service and good food.

<Content> This review is a bit late in coming since I haven't eaten there since 1999, but this is what I wrote back then: Is this the best Italian place in town? I don't know - I always get one of the fish specials - it's definitely the best place in town to get fish. Portions are small, especially for an Italian place, which makes it a better "date" place - you don't have to worry about getting bloated. You will even have room left to gourmandize one of their great desserts with your date.

<Content> I really enjoyed a celebratory dinner I recently had at at Timpone's. I'd always meant to try it out but never had. The food was really good, the service was excellent and it had a nice cozy romantic feel. It was, however, pretty expensive, particularly for being located on a college campus. The food was fantastic but portions were on the small side, especially considering the prices. The peach bread pudding was scrumptious. I probably won't be back, not because it wasn't good, but because there are a lot of other upscale places in town I'd like to try before I break the bank at Timpone's again, and special occasions that warrant a $100 tab only come along so often.

<Content> I love this place. The menu rotates occasionally, and there is a specials board when you walk in (make sure to check the board or ask the server...sometimes the servers forget to tell you about the specials). Food had always been stellar, from the basic burger to elegant salads, intriguing pizzas, and awesome pastas. My fav is the gorgonzola gnocci, which is a rotating item. Dessert is also good, maybe a bit pricey. Creme brulee is always there and very good, gelato too.

<Content> Timpone's reminds me of Italian places at home run by a family you grew up with, and you just go because they are part of the community. I've never really been wowed by the food. It's average. And really too expensive for college kids. Good not great.

<Content> They really do a good job. We invited 20 clients to go last night and called with a 1/2 hr notice for a reservation.  They balked, but said they could do it. We arrived and they accommodated the group just fine. We relaxed with a few bottles of wine ordered our meals and enjoyed some appetizers and conversation.  Soon, everything came out of the kitchen and was great. Later the Chef or Owner came up to check in with us and received great feedback from all. The meal was a success and everyone was happy. We will be back!

<Content> I've now been to Timpone's a couple of times for lunch (it seems like whenever I visit UIUC someone takes me here). It's pretty much located on campus, which makes it an easy destination if you're working for the university. The food is vaguely Italian with some American influences, and it's pretty good overall if not mind-blowing. Last time I was there I had the tuna burger, which wasn't bad, although I was a little disappointed when the tuna turned out to be a tuna patty and not an actual piece of tuna. They give you free bread... nice. Friendly service too. I just wish the food were a little more impressive.

<Content> This place has been here for a long time but I think it's still trying to figure some things out The menu is very ambitious for a campustown location, serving up "campustown" pizza along side upscale American/French/Italian fare. The dining room is upstairs and is nice enough in a traditional way, but the look and ambience are very dated. The quality of service is not in line with the menu. Our server was clearly overwhelmed. Our table had white linens bespeaking of a "nice" restaurant but was set improperly. Wrong silverware, no bread plates. We sat for quite some time before our drink order was taken, then our waiter left in the middle of taking the drink order to serve food to another table. He eventually returned to take our drink order and then asked us for our entire food order at the same time. Bread service was slow though the bread was good. The glass of riesling we ordered was clearly from a bottle that had been left open for too long. Another glass from a fresh bottle arrived after a while.We ordered some salads to start off the meal. The bistro salad looked great - field greens, asparagus, potato, poached egg, bacon, vinaigrette. However, when the salad arrived, there was no bacon. Ahem. "Excuse me, but our salads have no bacon." Response: "OMG, forgot the bacon." Instead of taking our salads away and giving us new ones, we were given small bowls of bacon pieces to put on the salads ourselves. Please.We ordered a wild mushroom pizza with sausage and gorgonzola but we wanted to substitute goat cheese for the gorgonzola. We were told this was not possible. Restaurant policy is no substitutions, just subtractions. We could remove the g-z but could not add goat cheese. We ended up using the build your own pizza option and built the pizza we wanted. What a pain in the a**! The pizza was delicious though. The thin crust must be one of the best I've ever had.The entrees were generally very good. The American "kobe" skirt steak was tasty, having a sweet marinade reminiscent of Korean kalbi in flavor. The duck breast was well prepared. The trout was overcooked but was still edible.The desserts were adequate and there is a good selection of after dinner drinks and dessert wines.In summary, Timpone's has an identity crisis. If they want to serve this type of food, then there is a level of service that is expected to go along with it which they did not meet. It's hard to enjoy any restaurant when you are unhappy with the service. My recommendation is to go for the pizza - then you won't need a bread plate.

<Content> Went there twice while in town for Science Olympiad. Lunch was flavorful, help was pleasant even with some menu confusion and the fact we showed up just before lunch closing. Didn't rush us at all. Had shrimp and broccoli pizza (lunch and dinner), pasta with eggplant and amazing homemade ice cream for desert. Looked at dinner menu and decided we had to go back next night for dinner since they had duck on the menu. Dinner was also very good. Would definitely go back next time I'm in town.

<Content> This place has great food. Its all priced really reasonably. We've only gotten take out. The salsa is hot though. All of it. The vegetarian options are really great. I'm glad we have a fantastic Mexican food option in Urbana.I'm hoping to try their breakfast sometime. Some of the Urbana fire fighters go there (I've seen the trucks outside frequently), so I'm assuming its pretty good.

<Content> Huaraches offers a large variety of entrees and is extremely tasty for the price. This is definitely one of the top mexican restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area, along with Maize. They give HUGE horchatas and I would definitely recommend getting one!My only complaint is that it takes WAY too long to get your bill at the end of the meal. I can confirm this because I've eaten here multiple times. There is only one waiter who serves for an entire restaurant that's always packed, so be prepared to wait just as long as you did to get a seat to wait for your receipt. Dinner lengths here are double what they would be anywhere else simply because of this understaffing issue.

<Content> Don't let the outside fool you, go on in. 4 salsas, each distinct from mild to hot & home made chips, great! Fajitas Huaraches Moroleon was HUGE and delicious. Wife had a Chicken Chimichanga that she also liked very much.  Guacamole appetizer was as good as everyone has mentioned. Only downside, this is a very small place, about 12 tables so don't tell anyone about it :)

<Content> Always love this place! Try their lunch special with 2 beef enchiladas, 1 chicken taco, and rice and beans ($6.99). Delicious! Their chips are a little on the greasy side, but they're still addicting. Yummy sauces to accompany them. Try this little place!

<Content> We have previously loved this place, but our last visit, on Sunday evening, was less than great. Service was a bit slow initially, but the real problem was a very messed up order. Ordered cheese dip, didn't get it. Two of our 4 meals had MINOR adjustments (add cheese, no onion) that weren't made. When I ask them to fix it, the response is, "you're gonna have to wait a few minutes." When my meal comes back, it doesn't have onion, or two other ingredients that were supposed to be on it. Chip basket went empty the whole meal. Never did get the bill--finally just went to the register, where I also had to ask for the carryout boxes. Service matters to us, and they're going to have to do better on an almost $50 meal if they want us to keep coming back.

<Content> This is a local 5. It is really the only legit Mexican place around. Sorry Maize, you have good ingredients, but your burritos are wrapped too loosely and they are small. Huaraches has an authentic taste, great ingredients, and I haven't had anything bad from here. The side of nachos with jalapeu00f1os and ballpark nacho cheese threw me off the first time, but now I think it's charming. Now, compared to other areas, this might be a 4, but around here I think this is really the only game in town.

<Content> I like this place. As a number of other people have mentioned, the chips and salsa are great. The horchata is also delicious and they give you free refills (utter madness but I love it). However, it wasn't the best mexican I've had, not even close to the top 5. For whatever reason, I was craving enchiladas. They did not turn out well. The sauce that came on the enchilada tasted like it was from a can. just terrible. My girlfriend's meal was much better. She had two steak tacos that looked pretty tasty. She really enjoyed her meal. I'll be back to see if they just misfired on the enchiladas.Update: I came back and ordered the fish tacos. they were not good. won't be back.

<Content> The carnitas are the best I have ever had. This is some seriously tender and perfectly slow cooked pork. It was crispy in some parts, soft in others and downright flavorful all around! My only question is why can't any of the Mexican restaurants in the Chicago area make food half as tasty as these guys? I can't drive out to Urbana every weekend...

<Content> Stumbled upon this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Doesn't look like much outside and only has 11 tables inside. Appears carry out is big for them. We ate in and were very excited at the list of authentic dishes and options on the menu. My sister had a veggie dish with cactus as the 'meat' and She LOVED it! My alpastor carcinitos(??) was excellent. My daughter loved the chicken tacos. We will be back!!

<Content> Thought it doesn't look great on the outside, Huaraches Moroleon is cozy and charming inside, with friendly staff and authentic smells and tastes. I ordered a huarache, carry-out, which I have never tried before. It was a corn-based shell containing steak, cheese, lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and pineapple (!), if memory serves me correctly. The sweetness of pineapple in this fried concoction added a really nice touch. Some places place too much meat on the food, others have too many toppings, or use too much oil. The huarache was a bit on the greasy side, but overall it was balanced. The sauces they provided, too, tasted homemade, and I didn't remember how unique they were until I saw some of the other reviews here. I was quite pleased with the meal, and would definitely stop by again.

<Content> It took me a long time to stop by this place, but now that I live a block away, I'm there all the time! Great drink selection, and their margaritas aren't too sweet or too sour - just right. Their fish taco's are freakin' amazing. The only thing I have against this place is that all their salsas are spicy (and I'm a weakling when it comes to spice). But! They are redeemed by their queso dip - top of it's class. You'll see me here all the time - moreso once they put out their patio seating!

<Content> It's not bad. The highlight of Huaraches Moreleon (and what keeps us coming back more than anything else) is definitely their homemade chips and the three sauces they bring out with them. Molto bene! I mean, muy bueno! Whatever. They're pretty good.The best entree they make is the Aver Si Puede ("See if You Can"), which is basically a gigantic plate of meat with some rice and beans thrown in the middle in case you were in need of inferior sources of protein to feel like you're eating Mexican food. It feeds two large people or a small family of small people. Their basic enchilada sauce is not much more than watered-down tomato sauce. The mole sauce is ok. The chipotle sauce on the Enchiladas Suizas is probably the best I've had thus far. Still, even the worst enchiladas are pretty decent.I like the breakfast skillets. Don't order soup.I have not had good experiences with their more "exotic" offerings such as tripas or lengua tacos. Either the chef does not know how to make them, or the ingredients are poor. Superior tripas tacos can be found on literally any taco truck operating in the area between Santa Monica and Houston, TX. Go to Huaraches, but avoid these menu items.Oh, the prices are reasonable, and the service is typically fast unless you order the more "exotic" offerings I mentioned.The food is great for the area, but it still doesn't hold a candle to most Mexican food in the Southwest. For that I have to give it four out of five stars. But you should still go. This is a small, fledgling place, and it deserves your custom.

<Content> The best Mexican food in Champaign-Urbana. Everything is fresh and delicious. I especially like the Shrimp a la Diablo, fish tacos, and unique breakfast items, such as the tilapia omelet. When the owner can get fresh habaneros, the habaneros sauce is fantastic, striking a delicate balance between bringing out the flavor of the pepper without overpowering your taste buds with heat. However, since he believes in quality, if high quality ingredients aren't available, neither will the sauce. If you want good, solid, unpretentious real Mexican food, this is the place for you.

<Content> I used to live up the street when this building housed Sweet Betsy's, then Skully's, then Fin-N-Feather. Since we've moved I haven't had occasion to drive by very frequently, but I was pleased to see a new place here that finally looked like it might have a chance to stay. I've been eyeing it for a while, and finally happened to be by today at lunch and stopped in. I am so glad I did, and I'll be finding a reason to head over that direction again soon.The carnitas huarache was fantastic. Really flavorful carnitas: juicy and tender with a great char outside. The huarache itself was tasty, and the cheese was great too - not that plastic stuff you get most places. It came with a little bag of perfectly fried, thin and crispy chips and 3 salsas that ranged from fruity to spicy. I wasn't a huge fan of any of the salsas in all honesty, but the huarache more than made up for it.There are 3 tables that seat 4 and a couple of tables for 2, plus some counter seating. I don't think that building has ever been so sparkling and clean, even way back when it was Sweet Betsy's years ago. They obviously did a lot of work in there. The service was quick and friendly too.

<Content> I am sad to see Fin-n-feather go, which was the previous restaurant at this location. They had my favorite fried fish in town..But I decided to make the best of it and try the new place. I've now been twice, very pleased each time. My girlfriend and I have tried the carnitas huarache, a torta alpastor special, the tongue tacos, and the carnitas burrito. They've all been great. Fresh vegetables and flavorful, tender meat.The huarache came with a grilled pineapple to put on it. I was a little skeptical but it was delicious. Everything comes with cilantro and onion, and most come with lettuce and tomato. Our take-out meals came with a bag of fresh fried chips and three little plastic containers of sauce - one salsa verde, one fruity salsa, and one more spicy orange salsa. They were all excellent. (The second time we went, the chips were a little more greasy, but they had definitely been recently fried.)They're fast on take-out, and if they stay this good, it may be hard to eat in at one of the tables.My only complaint is that they do not have horchata at the moment.My two favorite places for Mexican in town now are Mas Amigos and this place - and both are excellent. The prices on most entrees is around $6-7 - which is actually comparable to what it costs to get enough fast food to fill us up. Between Chipotle, Taco Bell, or here, the choice is clear.

<Content> My first ever yelp review and it has to go to Huaraches Moroleon! I love this place so much! Not only my favorite Mexican spot, but one of my top 5 favorite Urbana restaurants.-Staff is friendly and accommodating-The chips are so fresh and crispy and delicious-They have a separate VEGETARIAN MENU!!! I've been to lots of Mexican restaurants and have never seen that. It has some delicious unique options like CACTUS fajitas and a nice fresh salad with pineapple chunks, cactus, veggies, pico de gallo, and beans-I always skip the cheese and sour cream to make stuff VEGAN and let me tell you, with all of the fresh flavors, I don't miss the dairy at all!-The sauces! Oh my, they bring out 3 bottles of house-made sauces to the table with the chips, and those sauces.....the green is my favorite and the smoky red comes in a close second!!!-The guacamole is fresh and just as yummy as guac can be-Also it's always an awesome value-Did I mention they have a full breakfast menu too??!-I could go on and on but I will stop now. Can't wait til my next visit!

<Content> This is the best Mexican restaurant in Urbana, for sure. Sorry Maize, but you have no soul. The salsas are what makes this place special. The first is an orange-colored creamy chipotle salsa, the second is a green creamy salsa made with tomatillos and avocado, and the last one is a light, smokey flavored dark red salsa. Carne asada or the barbacoa are great on tacos or sopes. The al pastor is a little too greasy. If you go here please get anything but a burrito: burritos are NOT Mexican. You're missing out if you go for a burrito here. And get your tacos with cilantro and onion. None of that lettuce cheese tomato.

<Content> Came here for dinner recently, and I was happy with my experience. The staff is friendly and attentive, and you're provided with a free basket of chips and salsas (3 types, all spicy) when you're seated. Between the chips and the two tacos I ordered (at $1.90 each), I was full. The chips are filling, so be prepared to take home leftovers if you order a big entree. The al pastor was a good balance of fat and meat, and the carnitas was a bit dry but still tasty. I also ordered a glass of horchata (not on the menu), and thought it was perfectly spiced and milky.

My husband and I had a horrible realization one night when we got Taco Bell and only afterwards realized it was $1 taco night at Huaraches. Noooooooo, worst decision ever! In summary, Taco Bell is awful and not even that cheap anymore. Go to Huaraches instead.

The option of 3 sauces with your chips is totally amazing. I tried them all and ended up mixing them. I just wonder what happens to them after people are done??? are they recycled??? The waiter was attentative and the food was very flavorful, too. Very large soft drinks.  Hand made items. I think it cost a little over $20 for two adults.

Their huaraches are amazing and they have this cactus dish (name escapes me) which is also fantastic and quite healthy. They always 4-5 different kinds of salsas which change every time I visit.On top of that, this place is very cheap.

The beans they serve are delicious, as is the rice. Make sure to check the specials on the board behind the cash register. It can be easy to miss but usually has some yummy options. The chocolate cake is definitely for 2 people and not cheap but soooo yummy. Also good horchata.Guacamola is also not cheap but straight outta the avocado fresh and enough for 4 probably.

The taco shells were super fresh and I love that they provided the lime wedges to give everything that extra fresh taste. The torillas were excellent as well. They worked very hard to revamp this place it looks totally different and the decor is very nice. Small and like a previous reviewer stated, if they stay consistent with this quality, it will be hard to find a seat. Much like It is hard to get a set at Black Dog. We will be taking the kids very soon.

<Content> Okay, this is a storefront type restaurant, so the tacky decor can be forgiven. What can't be forgiven is the filth. The dining area is smaller than my living room which means there is no excuse for not keeping it clean. The ceiling fans were caked with dust and grit as were many of the surfaces. The floor was filthy. Come on, guys, that place could be cleaned daily in less than 15 minutes. If the public area is that way, one can imagine what is in the kitchen. I took my food home, opened the box, was craving Mexican food, but could not get myself to eat any of it, thinking of the general filth of the dining area and its implications for the kitchen. I like seeing little places like this succeed, so I hope that someone decides to start cleaning this place on a regular basis. No one likes clumps of dust dropping into their food from a neglected ceiling fan or wondering what the hygiene is in the kitchen.

<Content> Oh my goodness, oh my goodness! This place is fabulous! This location has had a lot of restaurants occupy it, but this Mexican restaurant is to die for! I was the only one there.... They had a few specials on the board and I saw fish tacos (3) for $5.99. I ordered those and a mexican coke. I sat down at one of the nice booths (restaurant easily seats 30+) and the nice waitress brought out a generous portion of chips and four salsas. There was a mild, spicy, green and another medium/mild. The chips were warm and crunchy. Almost finished the basket! The fish tacos came out soon after and they were great! The fish was lightly breaded and fried.... I wish they were grilled, but I didn't ask.... There was a generous mound of onions, cilantro, cabbage and a mayonaise based drizzle on top! They were great! I also got a mexican coke.... It came out warm, but drinking warm coke reminds me of my grandparents...they used to serve us warm coke so it was nostalgic for me.... I bet it would bother a lot of other people.... But anyways, the bill came out to about $8.60.  Not bad!  I would say that this place would give Maize a run for its money.... They have a lot more seating and the food is just as good if not better. Too bad it's waaay out in Urbana...They're also open for breakfast.... I will definitely be back to try some other things!! I hope they don't fall suit to the prior restaurants at this location....that would be a terrible loss.

<Content> I hate to give this place a bad review, because the first time I went, it was delicious! The guacamole is great and the service is friendly. However, the last time I went it was so terrible that I don't think I'll be going back again. The server informed me that it was $1 tacos, so obviously that's a deal, but they were so bad that I couldn't even eat them. I got three different kinds, all of which tasted like burnt, old meat, topped with slimy cilantro and onion-- no tomato, lettuce, cheese, or sour cream-- which was confusing to me, since my friend had ordered hard tacos and had gotten the listed toppings. Her hard shells tasted stale! I filled up on tons of guacamole and chips and salsa, but I feel like their food quality has gone down since opening.

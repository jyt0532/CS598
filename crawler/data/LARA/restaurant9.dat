<Content> Nothing too surprising here.....cupcakes are tasty and the store is really cute but a bit pricy (approx. $3.50 each and no price break for 3 dozen:(There are so many similar cupcakes joints and I'm waiting for one of them to do something super special...like sell a giant cupcake for 2 for the same price. Standard cupcakes are too small for all that buttery frosting but they are good...I like more cake, less frosting which may not be the most popular.

<Content> I came and ordered their pistachio macaroon, velvet cupcake and chocolate mousse cupcake, all of which were simply too sweet. Being sweet is not necessarily a problem, but ither than that, there was nothing else. Was quite disappointed. However, their customer service wad pretty good, hence the two stars.

<Content> When it comes to desserts, cupcakes are pretty low on my list. Ice cream is the best, obviously, followed by other frozen treats. Even donuts are higher than cupcakes.So, when someone suggests cupcakes I usually roll my eyes and recommend we get ice cream instead. Usually I win, but not this time.Anyways, I had a dark chocolate cupcake that was easily the best I've ever had. The cake was incredibly moist and the frosting was really really light, like a mix of butter cream and whipped cream. I loved it.My friend had the vanilla bean and I didn't really like it. Heavy sugary frosting with normal cake texture.At $7 for two little cupcakes, the prices are really high. You could buy a lot of ice cream with $7!

<Content> When you walk into the store it can be intimidating at first, because everything seems so high end and kind of expensive. But the cupcakes are delicious. They have unique flavors that change everyday, so that was pretty cool. Overall, the atmosphere is cute and relaxing. The decorations are really beautiful here. There isn't a lot of places to sit though, so that's the downside if you don't want it to-go.

<Content> Love their HUGE pinwheel macarons ranging from strawberry, vanilla bean, passionfruit, hazelnut, and pistachio! The buttercream filling for macarons and cupcakes is the best ive ever tasted-- creamy with a hint of sweetness (unlike the overwhelming sweetness of most buttercreams. I want to steal their buttercream recipe!

<Content> The feel of this place is great-the decor is really trendy and cute, and I like how it's open late. I got the dark chocolate cupcake and thought that it was just okay. The frosting and cake were both too light for me--I couldn't really taste the dark chocolate. I've had much better cupcakes from Sprinkles in Chicago. Plus, this cupcake was pretty expensive considering how small it is.I'd probably go here with friends again if we were in downtown Champaign looking for something to do. But otherwise, I wouldn't bother.

<Content> This place is overrated. I still don't know why they changed the name but what I do know is that the quality of their products changed as well and not in a good way. There needs to be a larger variety of goods. The cupcakes are smaller and cost more. Wtf?? Additionally the cupcakes were stale and dense. Dunno if they were from the day before? Disappointed with the quality of the confections. Hopefully things improve...

<Content> MAKE CUPCAKES, NOT WAR. That's what the employee's shirt said. I wanted it. Cakes is open at 7 am every morning. The interior has trendy hardwood floors and white tables and chairs. Note you can also get Capogiro gelato and cocktails(!) here.The Aztec chocolate cupcake had decent choc cake and some red-hot-cinnamon-chili taste to the frosting, which was marshmallow-fluff-like in texture. The cake in the cinnamon blood orange (cinnamon flavored) and margarita (lime flavored) cupcakes was okay, but the frosting on both had a waxy, almost foamy texture. Not my cup of tea... or cup of cake. I didn't finish the frosting, and I NEVER never finish the frosting!

<Content> The first time I came here was when this place was still called Cakes on Walnut. I absolutely love their red velvet cupcakes! The cream cheese frosting is very light and it does not feel like you're gonna get a hear attack. I'm from Chicago and there are tons of cupcake places around here, but I would say that Cream & Flutter is no doubt on the top of my list. Aside from cupcakes, their macarons is pretty good too. Sometimes it can feel as if you're digesting a lot of butter from the butter cream, but it's pretty darn good. I love macarons and even though they're made to be bite size, you won't regret purchasing it. They also have a variety of coffee and tea selection. Very versatile dessert place. Every time I make a visit to champaign, getting a cupcake from here is a MUST.

<Content> We stopped by here a couple of months ago after lunch nearby to satisfy a sweet craving. The interior is cute and there are little tables if you want to dine in. The cupcakes are obviously pricier than if you made them at home, but not out of the ordinary for a bakery or specialty shop. I had the dark chocolate cupcake, which I thought was really good. I like sweet frosting and it was sweet and fluffy. My only complaint is that I thought it would be a little bigger.I would definitely stop here again when I'm in the area and try another flavor. I heard there was a s'mores flavored cupcake, which I'd love to try.

I also really like that Champaign is on board with having trendy places like this, especially for the downtown area. It was badly needed and it makes a great spot to go with your girl-friends or on a date for dessert!

Whenever good ingredients are used, the price goes up, so if you are into mass-produced Walmart cupcakes, then yeah, it might seem pricey.I find the small cupcake is big enough for dessert... but then again I always feel guilty about dessert!I am a huge fan of their constantly changing flavors, their awesome decor, the wine list, the cool staff and the location.

<Content> I just moved here about 4 months ago and I had a cupcake store I really loved back in Austin, and I had been craving it so thought I'd give it a try for Valentine's Day. My husband picked up 2 red velvet cupcakes and brought them home. The icing was really good, very creamy, soft and light, not overly sweet but very rich. The cake was good but didn't knock my socks off like my old place. I really felt like the price for that size of cupcake was too much. I would expect them to be the big cupcakes for what they are charging. I may go back to try one of the more specialty flavors, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. My husband said the store itself seemed very trendy.

<Content> I love their angel food cake cupcakes topped with freshly whipped icing and fresh fruit. However, it could do with a better price tag. Freakin' $5 for a teeny tiny cupcake? No. I miss Cakes on Walnut's ginormous cupcakes topped with a ton of buttercream frosting and friendly staff. Now, I'm forced to stand in line with servers who either have plastic smiles or just cold stares. Service is such a big component of the food industry! It makes me sad, since the decor is beautiful and very hipster. Chic, modern and on trend, but the staff could definitely improve. They have a nice array of artisan candles, ice cream and lotions for sale as well. (Equally overpriced, unfortunately).

<Content> I have to say, the Cakes on Walnut interior decor is adorable!! It reminds me of the artwork sold at Urban Outfitters- and the bathroom paintings are extremely cute. The place looks really clean, and the staff is very friendly. I think since the last few reviews were written, however, the prices of the cupcakes have gone up. ($3.25 per and $18 for half a dozen). Also as a temporary relocate from the Bay Area, I was expecting a lot more, when I heard of the little cup-cakery. Not that the cupcakes are bad- I just find them extraordinarily...ordinary for the price they are sold at.The cakes are very moist, and light- very normal tasting cupcakes(I had the lemongrass white tea and strawberry something something), which is a stark contrast to the heavy, rich icing on the tops. Its worth a try just for the atmosphere and friends, but the actual cakes dont really do it for me at $3.25 per.

<Content> If I could, my review would be a 2.5My husband and I visited Cakes on Walnut on a Saturday around 2.  We were going to go eat lunch at Radio Maria, but wanted to stop here first (in case they closed before we got done). When we saw they offered lunch, we decided to eat there. So, for $25- we got 2 sandwiches, a cupcake, a brownie, a root beer and a diet pepsi. NOW, the sandwiches were made with local ingredients, which is fantastic, and makes me willing to pay more. I had chicken salad- it was ok. Husband had the mozzarella pesto tomato panini- it was also ok.  Red velvet cupcake was ok. Chocolate nubs on top were not....they were bitter and not good.  Husband really enjoyed his brownie.The rip on the rating? Yea, that would be the staff. The girl who waited on us was fine. One of the owners was there, though, and she didn't even smile. No thank, nothing. I own a small business...I expect more, I suppose. But if two new people, from out of town come into your business and drop $25 on some lunch, a thank you is nice. Or a smile. Or something.

<Content> First - if you needed another reason to enjoy cupcakes - Cakes on Walnut makes an effort to be green about their indulgences; they encourage patrons to bring in their own containers for take-away cupcakes and offer a discount to those who do. Now, the cupcake selection itself was a touch limited. This past Saturday there was only one ("confetti" - their take on the Pillsbury classic "funfetti") that wasn't chocolate or pumpkin. One white-cake crowded by chocolate, chocolate lavender, black and white, and red velvet (chocolate cake died red). Um, variety is the spice of life? At least they offer variety in the size of the cupcakes (mini to large). But the coffee!! Three cheers for French Press Coffee! You get to take the whole little tureen back to your table to enjoy at your leisure (one french press contains about 4 cups of coffee). As true coffee connoisseurs will agree, the tastiest coffee comes from french presses. Overall, the place is adorable and clearly beloved as it was nonstop busy throughout our stay. I will definitely be back on my next trip to downtown Champaign.

<Content> This rating is not about the cupcakes...because I didn't get to have any. Aside from seeing my fabulous friends, this place was what I was most looking forward to on my trip to the area. I've heard about the yummy treats for a while now, and was SO excited to get to go.So, post dinner and hockey game on Saturday night, we waltzed down Walnut...just in time to see the shop being locked up. Whaaaa? I(well, we ALL) were expecting late night goodies at a place known for late night hours. Evidently, Cakes on Walnut has recently changed their hours, and alas, are now not the "post bar" go-to. No biggie, we'll just stop back tomorrow. Errr, wait. Closed on Sundays. Hmmm...Monday, before we leave??? No dice. They don't open 'till Noon. Boo Hiss. Perhaps if I'm ever in town and get to taste these cakes, I can actually rate them. *I'm giving them two stars, because only Funky-McNasty places with bad service get one star in my book(which I don't think would describe this place)...but my bummed out sweet tooth thinks I'm a softie.

<Content> I suppose that I'm a pretty simple person, in that what I've paid ordinarily for the ingredients for a batch of cupcakes is roughly the same price as one cupcake here. Cakes on Walnut is the latest in a series of trendy food spots where one can have the pleasure of overpaying for pretty simple treats. Perhaps, though, it may no longer be the latest; fashion is fickle. That said, it was with great curiosity that I dove into the wild world of designer cupcakeries. Studies have shown that merely being told a bottle of wine is expensive makes it taste better; so perhaps it would follow with cupcakes as well?Cakes on Walnut is located in a cozy part of "downtown" Champaign, nestled in the neighborhood of Jane Addams, Dandelion, and The Blind Pig. A rather hip part of town, I'm told. The shop is inviting; a large front window allows you to catch a faint sight of the delicious morsels awaiting you. Not to mention that the smell of cupcakes almost demands that you enter, if for no other reason than to bask in the cupcake smell. The inside of the shop is rather nondescript, tables and chairs, nice and minimalist. I appreciate that, although I do wonder if it was done as an aesthetic choice at times. The real life in the shop seems to spring from the brightly colored cupcakes beckoning you from behind the counter. No shier from temptation, I chose the lemon cupcake, a sweet vanilla cupcake with lemon frosting and what I believe were LemonHeads inside the frosting. Delicious. My girlfriend got the salted caramel cupcake, so I was able to try two cupcakes for one visit.My impression was... whelmed. Both cupcakes were rather delicious, though they were essentially just mountains of frosting heaped on top this fragile little cake. The cake itself was not very memorable. I'm not sure whether to attribute this to the frosting overload or just that the cake is, well, nondescript. But there it is.So, would I recommend it? I certainly wouldn't dissuade you from visiting. The frosting is pretty delicious. But really, that's just it. If you're willing to spend a little time getting messy, and a few minutes googling "cupcake recipes," I might just tell you to save your money and just make your own cupcakes. At least you'll get more than one.

<Content> I have been in C o W several times with friends. On my second visit with friends I tried the Red Velvet cupcake. It was dry and the frosting was waxy and stiff, more for decoration than eating. I did not finish it but gave it to a friend and she had the same comment. Very expensive for what you get, this is not Chicago.  I agree with a previous review that you are paying mostly for the snappy decor. I will go in with friends but I never purchase anything there.Selection very limited. The small cupcakes are VERY small and overpriced at $2.75 each for basically 2 bites.

<Content> The cupcakes need work. If they're using all natural & local ingredients, you should refine your recipe around this concept before you sell them. I give them a 3/10 for cupcake quality because it was dry and so small for the price. Also -- a 1/10 for owner professionalism and business ethics. Decor? .... an attempt. This place is only popular for cupcakes in Champaign because there's nothing else around here. Nice try.

<Content> Being a non-C-U native yet someone who must spend a good portion of her life in the area, I've come to know many of the dining establishments in both the C and the U side of town. Like so many other transplants, I find my emotions about dining in Champaign-Urbana range between two: either desperate for something decent or disappointed that yet another place stunk. If you are looking for anything beyond a chain experience (Biaggi's, Chili's, Panera, etc.) the few diamonds in the rough are hard to come by.Couple this with the fact that cupcakeries have sprung up across the country in the past few years like a blight, with little to no quality control or easy way to distinguish the good from the bad, and my concern about Cakes on Walnut was already piqued before even sampling their offerings. But that concern quickly evaporated after my first visit, and now Cakes is a must-stop for me, as I am expected to walk through the door in the city in which I reside with a box of the latest cupcakes from Champaign. Cakes delivers on its name by offering eight varieties of cupcakes each day, ranging from the staple (vanilla; red velvet) to the exciting (smore; limoncello). Contrary to what a couple of other reviewers have said, these cakes do _not_ taste like a mix, but taste and are homemade - you can watch the process go down in the open kitchen area, if you like. The frosting is delectable, although you will have a hard time avoiding wiping a fair amount of it on your nose as you attempt to eat it.The ambiance is nice and charming, hand-painted with a swallow motif on the wall and cute, modern interior. The bar is a nice touch and great place to enjoy a cupcake with a glass of milk or French press coffee. The staff are friendly and warm and don't mind if you nurse your single cupcake for awhile, or grab them to go.Cakes on Walnut is one of the few truly special food destinations in C-U and one of the few whose reputation crosses the city limits. I am a fan.

<Content> Holy sugar high Batman! This place is a great place to stop for a dessert after lunch or dinner in Downtown Champaign and now that the weather is warming up should be a great place to hang out on the patio. I had the vanilla cupcake with the most amazing icing EVER! The cake itself was pretty dry (I like a more dense, moist cake and cupcake) but the icing had me making inappropriate noises in the middle of the afternoon! The decor is definitely Ikea-chic and the seating is not designed for comfortable conversation, but the DT Champaign hipsters in there on their laptops didn't seem to mind. The other major negative was $2 for a glass of milk. Talk about profit margin.....I can get a GALLON of milk at Aldi for $1.99 (and I'm guessing the owners of Cakes do too!). Overall though, not a bad place, and I'll definitely swing by for a grab and go during my next stop in Chambana.

<Content> EDIT:I heard that some improvements had been made, so I went back and gave it another try. This time, it was fabulous. The cakes were moist, tender, and really tasty. Prices still high, but this time it seemed worth it. They have lowered the prices for a dozen cupcakes and dropped the box charge. They also took cereal off the menu.Minus 1 star because of the prices and because the gelato that comes with the $6 pairing wasn't that great. The serving was also really small. I'll skip the gelato and stick with a cupcake and a nice glass of milk when I go back. I'd also prefer a sweeter, less greasy frosting, but that's a personal taste thing and It's probably not fair to fault them for my personal preference.Overall, I was very impressed with the changes. It made for a really nice evening to sit at the outdoor bar and enjoy a great cupcake on a warm spring evening, and I look forward to doing so again soon.*******I REALLY wanted to love this place. I went in a few days after they opened and was disappointed to see that they are very overpriced. But I didn't let that get me down. I figured the prices must be reflective of the quality, and I got ready to sample what I expected would be some phenomenal cupcakes. To my dismay, these expensive cupcakes are really not that good. The few I brought home for everyone to sample were extremely dry and bland. The texture reminded me of the free hunk of cake you get for your birthday at cheesy chain restaurants.I'd had very high hopes for the salted caramel, but there was no hint of salt and the caramel element tasted like sugar that had been burnt, not caramelized. The Red Velvet had a hint of cream cheese flavor in the frosting, but wasn't very sweet and had no chocolate flavor. The high point was the strawberry balsamic, which was a nice combination of flavors but, like the others, very poorly executed. It was really just a plain, dry, flavorless cupcake with some pretty decent strawberry frosting (which I actually liked very much) and a drizzle of thick vinegar. Overall though, I'm sorry to report that I've had better cupcakes from a box.Speaking of boxes, if you want one to carry your cupcakes home in, It'll cost you $1. With as much as they're charging for the cupcakes, you'd think they'd give you something to carry them home in. Nope. That's extra. Insult to injury, if you will.I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again in a few months to give them a chance to get into the swing of things and, with any luck, turn out a better cupcake. My hope is that the strawberry balsamic frosting is an indicator of a potential that they will reach once they get past the first few weeks. Unfortunately, I don't know that they'll be around in a few months and I'm also not sure that I'd be willing to pay their insane prices even if the cupcakes were to improve substantially.

<Content> Here I go being unpopular again, but I just was not impressed. Cream & Flutter just did not live up to the hype. Full disclosure: I don't get this cupcake thing. I see it on TV where these goofy people are making these cupcakes and having cupcake wars and shit. In going to Cream & Flutter, I was going to "get" this cupcake craze. After eating a decent chocolate cupcake that cost me $3.25, I'm kind of even more so in head scratching mode. At some level, I get it. I want use these local, natural ingredients but if that's the case, I want to taste that. Maybe I'm super entry level here, but I'd rather go to Meijer, buy a box of Funfetti (which is awesome), use the secret tips from one of my coworkers on what to add to spruce up Funfetti and make my own frosting. I could make a dozen for about six bucks.But y'all do you. If you got the cash money to drop 3 bones on a decent cupcake that you could probably make yourself if you tried hard enough, more power to you.

<Content> I really want to love Cakes on Walnut. I really do. I'm a fan of cupcake places up in Chicago, but Cakes on Walnut cannot compare to any of the places there. I gave this place 3 chances, and all three times i left feeling meh. For a cupcake place, the selection was poor. My cupcake tasted good, but not good enough for a place that specializes in cupcakes.There wasn't a lot of varieties, and the price was on a slightly inflated side. Besides the cupcakes, which is supposed to be the main attraction, there's not much draw to the place there besides the ample seating. Maybe I'll give this place a 4th chance sometimes, but I feel like I should spend my money at Pekara (for pasteries) or Kopi (for drinks) instead.

<Content> Good Things:-My "Pistachio Passion Fruit" cupcake. The cupcake was good and all, but it was the passion fruit whipped topping adorned with crunchy, salty pistachios that pushed it over the edge into Amazingville. At $2.50, I'm more than sold.-The "Lemongrass Pear" cocktail. They use Grey Goose vodka, which, at $7/cocktail, is a nice deal. It was a wonderful drink--refreshing and just a little sugary. Very complementary to my cupcake, too.-The plates they use are beyond adorable.Meh Things:-Raspberry Dessert Wine. Sounds good, but isn't. It's like drinking sweetened cough syrup.-The "Mexican Hot Chocolate" cupcake was good, but wasn't on the same plane of existence as the pistachio cupcake. The cake itself tasted like a snickerdoodle cookie, and the whipped topping tasted mostly like cinnamon. It wasn't bad, but I think The Boy was looking more for chocolate and less for cinnamon.-They had one person working the counter at 8 on a Friday night. It was probably about as busy as Cakes on Walnut gets....why only one person? She was taking orders, making drinks, getting the cupcakes, and just about everything else. As a result, there was a lot of wait time involved for people in line, and tables were not bussed properly.-The ambiance was a bit iffy. It was like...trying to be pretentious and indie-quirky all at the same time. All told, though, I'm a fan. Next time I'll skip buying the booze and go next door to the Blind Pig, have a lot of beer, and then go get some delicious, inexpensive cupcakes. To go.

<Content> I just inhaled my first cupcake from this place. They just earned a new frequent customer.Very girly store with cupcakes and cocktails, both done expertly. Creamy frosting prettily piped onto moist, delicious cupcakes. On fridays and saturdays you can swing by for either until 11pm. It's right in the center of Champaign downtown, making it perfect for pre-bar, post-dinner, or both on those days.

<Content> On the plus side, the place is adorable. A super cute place for date night, if only the desserts were good at, well, night.Yep, I'm going to have to agree with Sonny S. on this one. Somewhere around the time the name of this place changed, they stopped selling the larger versions of cupcakes, prices went up, and the cupcakes got drier. Is it because they're made earlier in the day and would taste fresher then? Maybe. But if you're going to stay open late-night (which, by the way, I would think you'd want to because I'm sure you get a lot of foot traffic from the downtown restaurants and bars), for goodness sakes, try to find a way to keep your product tasting fresh! As a side note, I did have a cookies & cream brownie here once and it was fantastic. I only wish the cupcakes were on par.

<Content> It is the local cupcakery and they do a pretty good job. The store is adorable and always love going inside and enjoying a cupcake over chit chat with friends. The only reason I rate them with a 3 is they usually only have 4-5 different cupcakes to choose from on any given day and they are a tad expensive for the area - many Chicago based cupcakeries charge equal or less per cupcake.These ladies are off to something great though - I think they would have even more business if they were on the U of I campus

<Content> Hey look...it's a cute little cupcake "bar". It will be interesting to see if this is a success. The atmosphere is pleasant, but still looks a little unfinished. At first glance the menu is expensive: $2.50 for a small cupcake and $5 lavender soda. However, it's about the same price as a beer at the Blind Pig, and unlike with the beer, I can go to work after eating the cupcake. The beautifully decorated cupcakes I tried (green tea and salted caramel) were good, but not quite fantastic. I suspect they are still tweaking their recipe. The soda I tried was more like sparkling water with a hint of lavender, so it didn't really satisfy my craving for that flowery taste and I don't think it was worth $5. My friends did get tea though, which came in a beautiful clear teapot with a votive underneath that illuminated the table. I noticed that it's open late, so it might be a good late night snack for after you hit up the nearby hipster bars.

<Content> Hands down the best cupcakes I have ever had, yes, better than Sprinkles. Each cupcake is subtly flavored, sweet, but not overpowering, and topped with light cream. They also rotate their flavors regularly, and I have never seen the flavors they serve here anywhere else. Decor is chic and modern, a bit dim and the perfect place to hang out and chill with friends. They also serve delicious teas and mixed drinks...seriously, nothing beats sipping on a martini while eating cupcakes with your girlfriends here.Not someplace I'd come study despite their free wifi, but mainly because why would I want to ruin the Cakes on Walnut experience with something as painful as studying?? Definitely one of my favorite places to go when I feel like taking a well-deserved (...or not) break.

<Content> It's a place that serves cupcakes... whaddya want?Is it pricey? Yes. Is the layout goofy? You betcha. Too trendy? Indeed.But answer me this: do you like cupcakes? And I mean REALLY like cupcakes. Would you trade your prized bichon frise for the last available, day-old cupcake in the Schnuck's bakery?If the answer to that last question is yes, then do yourself a favor and try these cupcakes. You'll spend 5 times as much as you would for a typical cupcake, but you get 100 times the flavor. You can't argue with that math!And now they have macaroons!? Color me a fan!

<Content> I had previously read articles about the growing popularity of cupcake cafes around the country, so I was excited to see one arrive in Champaign over a year ago. Since its opening, I've visited Cakes on Walnut several times to sample the different options and observe the business's growth.This is certainly a prime spot for a date, as the atmosphere is sleek yet cozy. I've also always had friendly experiences with the employees during my visits. Unfortunately, when it comes to the focus of the store (the cupcakes), I have not always been impressed. I've heard that the batter is made with butter rather than oil, so the resulting cupcakes often seem too dry. The saving grace of the cakes is the rich and flavorful frosting. While other people have written complaints about the frosting being too "stiff," I think the texture is probably largely dependent on how long the cakes have sat on the counter prior to being consumed. I tend to agree with criticisms that the price seems a bit unreasonable given the quality of the food.Although the flavors are not entirely ingenious, I also do appreciate the attempt to offer some non-traditional cupcakes. The shop only offers a handful of flavors each day, but I can usually find one that piques my interest.Overall, Cakes on Walnut is worthy of a visit when you're looking for a special treat, but the price might be too prohibitive otherwise.

<Content> I've only had one cupcake from here, so this is based on very limited experience. But, in my one visit I formed a 3-star opinion. I came in around 9:30 on a Friday night. There were 4-5 cupcake flavors to choose from plus a brownie and maybe three different types of cookies. The setup of the shop is a little weird in that the cupcakes are displayed on the side, so if this place ever got busy and a line formed it would be a little chaotic to see which cupcakes were available and then actually get in line in front of the register. The menu was posted on the wall adjacent to the display case, but I didn't even notice it until I had my cupcake and was sitting down.But those are minor issues. I ordered a vanilla cupcake and took a seat. The cake itself was dry and the cupcake was way overpriced at $2.99 for being so small. The saving grace of my purchase was the icing. It was delicious! The sugar sprinkles on top were a great touch. I'd come here again for a cupcake, but I find the high pricetag really annoying and a major put-off.Cream & Flutter has cocktails in addition to milk, coffee, and tea. This makes me wonder if they are trying to position themselves as a place to hang out instead of a place to go just to wolf down a treat. If the former then the interior needs work. It's a bit stark and the chairs aren't the most comfortable to just sit and relax. A cozier atmosphere would be more conducive to sipping a cocktail and staying there longer. But, again, not sure if that's their goal or not.In short - I'd go back...begrudgingly.

<Content> So I always hunt down local cupcake shops when I travel for work and this one did not disappoint!My absolute favorite was the pumpkin spice - not too sweet and the frosting was perfect; the pumpkin flavor was really showcased in this cupcake instead of being masked by cinnamon or nutmeg.I also tried the Chocolate Stout - didn't really stand out and I despise places that put those darn cocoa nibs on top - they really are too hard to try to chew and end up ruining any attempt to savor the cupcake flavor. The red velvet was also kinda "meh" - the cake was too dense and the frosting was too sugary. Regardless, I will come back to try some more flavors, they have a good thing going here ...

<Content> I used to come here with my husband when he was attending law school at UIUC. It used to be called "Cupcakes on Walnut" or something like that, from my not-so-good recollection.At any rate, I always enjoyed the scenery of the place and how cheerful the place seemed to be. The servers were usually attentive and nice. Only on occasion did I ever feel they weren't welcoming. I loved the novelty cupcakes from "pink lemonade" to "s'mores" - the presentation was always nice and artfully done.It can get rather over crowded, leaving you no room to sit and savor your food. The beverages and other food items were overpriced for the quality put forth. So I don't recommend consuming those. Some cupcakes weren't worth all it was cracked up to be, but for the most part, I give this place two cupcakes up.

<Content> Pleasant service (and my wife says the servers all super cute, an opinion with which I concur).The reviews so far have been a bit harsh given our experience. Our cupcake (salted caramel) was quite good. It could have been a bit more moist, and others have noted this (let's hope the "Cakes" staff is reading these).The decor is nice, and the "open kitchen" concept works well.With some slight adjustments to their recipe, they could really be a hit. The place does have a spartan look right now, but as with everything else I give them the benefit of the doubt and expect they'll make changes or not make it. They've barely been open a week!As for the price, given that this is what they make and virtually all they sell, I think to come in, sit at the counter, eat a cupcake with a glass of water and chat for 15 minutes with a server, $3.25 is hardly enough for them to stay in business. Cupcake vs. latte at $3.25? Cupcake wins. My feeling is that they should perfect the cupcake and keep the price.We'll revisit our review after our next visit in a few weeks.

<Content> Here's a confession. I haven't even tried the cupcakes. HOWEVER, I have found myself getting to Cakes on Walnut as they open (7am) for the certainty of acquiring one of their delicious Cinnamon Banana Walnut muffins. It should be noted that their Blueberry muffins are delicious artful baked goods in their own right, but the Walnut is indeed something to write home about.Said muffin topped off with a french press coffee is the best way I've found to talk myself out of the house in the morning.P.S. Their internet never seems to work but I find you can steal it very reliably from somewhere else.

They're huge which had me doubting how good they'd be but I've tried several flavors and enjoyed them all. My girlfriend and I split a St. Germain flavored one on Valentine's Day that we still reminisce about; it was that good.

<Content> Cakes on Walnut is a interesting place: fun to grab a snack in the afternoon with friends, as well as a great date-nite stop. The decor is really visually interesting, with high ceilings, spacious seating and cupcake bar seating as well, but plenty of room to move around. What is brilliant about this little place is the gimmick: great cupcakes and alcohol. They have a different assortment of cupcakes everyday, and I have yet to try anything I didn't love but also did not surprise me. The Red Velvets are one of their classics, but the Coconut and Pistachio are spontaneous and amazing. Ideally, you should always try anything seasonally-related. A great perk to the cupcakes is the serving sizes; they have a regular and a petite size of each flavor. This allows you to either try multiple flavors if you cannot decide but have a threshold for sugar, as well adjust according to your appetite. They have a wide selection of wines (red and white), bottled beer and coffee-type drinks to go with the cupcakes depending on what kind of evening you are having.Located on a street filled with nice restaurants and bars, this is a great place to go at nights' end, or if you just need an afternoon pick-me-up. I highly recommend Cakes on Walnut.NOTE: Every year this bakery releases a fund-raising calendar in collaboration with other local merchants for a few dollars. The girls who work there pose with the baked goods and are dressed by local retailers. Also, like many of the cafes in the area, they sponsor local artists by hanging art on their walls for sale. Both are really good ways to support the local professional arts community in Champaign.

<Content> Love this place. When I am in town I always stop by.. for several reasons. First, I love sitting at the bar and enjoying any of their many great treats. The cupcakes are delish and constantly changing, so I am able to try a new kind every time. The tea... love it - roobios is the best, it tastes too damn sinful to be tea. And even better is the great selection of beer, wine, bubbly and hard booze drinks.It's a great place to meet new peeps, to browse the fun stuff they have for sale and to spend an evening.

<Content> I recently paid a visit here with a friend and was excited to actually try a cupcake. I have purchased cupcakes here before as gifts for friends and family but have never actually tried one myself. I really like the atmosphere. It's clean and cute and someplace different than the norm. In terms of the cupcake itself (I tried a banana cinnamon one), I thought the cake was a little dry but the frosting was light and delicious. Presentation of the cakes really helped to increase their edible appeal and I definitely appreciated the variety of new and interesting flavors. It's definitely worth the visit and the fact that they continually change the flavors means that you can keep going back and always find something different to try :)

<Content> I stopped by here with a friend while visiting from out of town, and just planned on grabbing a quick coffee... but after looking at all of the cupcakes behind the glass counter, I had to get a chocolate/chocolate. I'm definitely not a 'foodie', but this was probably the best cupcake I've ever had... (I qualify this statement by admitting that I don't eat a lot of cupcakes unless they say 'Hostess' on the packaging). The texture of the frosting was unbelievably light and creamy, and the cake was light and moist. And chocolate flavors were a perfect complement with the fresh pressed coffee.I may never eat Hostess cupcakes again. Coming from me, that means something.

<Content> Eh, it's okay. It's a boutique cupcake store, and though I don't share the abject hatred of the concept that one of my friends does (I can hear him scream about cupcakes and special treatment even when he's 3,000 miles away), it's rather expensive for desserts that are only pretty good.The red velvet cupcakes are really good, and the ice cream's not bad either, but you need to get there early. We'll stop by after going to dinner at Seven Saints, and it'll be wiped out. It's nice every once in a while if they have the right cupcakes, but not something that I'll miss when I leave Champaign.

<Content> I don't get the complaints about needing to have a billion different varieties of cupcakes. How many exactly are you all planning to eat?In my case... we ordered 1 of each... and at 8pm on a Saturday, that equaled 5 different flavors. I assume that the cupcakes aren't continuously baked throughout the day/night, so ours weren't perfectly fresh... however, most of them were still delightful. Chocolate hazelnut was by far my favorite. Red velvet letft a little to be desired (the frosting was fabulous though). You can also get ice cream, if your heart desires.I also love the decor of this place. Much like the frosting on many of our cupcakes, the atmosphere is light and fluffy. Very bright, lots of light, flowing fabric draping the walls/ceiling. It's a cute place. Super mega fun bonus... alcohol is served! You can enjoy your cupcakes with wine, beer...and I believe a limited selection of mixed drinks. I assume this given that I saw a few bottles of vodka on the wall. Unless there's a secret vodka cupcake recipe I don't know about (maybe that's the magic!), I'm assuming you can get a drink with that too.

If you like exotic, you might like the honey and lavender cupcake but for me, it just tasted like lavender perfume - barf. However, the chocolate and vanilla flavors are excellent. The boyfriend is a huge red velvet fan and by his standards, it's good.I don't understand the name change - I thought Cakes on Walnut was super cute and they could have sold the same stuff without an issue. Yes, they're a tad pricey, considering they are on par with cupcake prices in NYC. Otherwise, it's nice to have a local place to go for a quick cupcake pick-me-up.

<Content> When this little shop opened, I lived close to downtown and probably went in for cupcakes 3 times a week. They were cute, original, and most importantly delicious! There were two different sizes of cupcakes, and the flavors were always changing and improving. The girls who ran the shop were friendly and helpful, and I just loved going in to see what was new.Unfortunately, over the last year or two this place has started to slip. They changed their name to Cream & Flutter, and it seems the name change has brought them nothing but bad luck. They did away with their larger cupcakes, leaving only standard size. That wouldn't be so bad, but these standard sized cupcakes are now being sold for what the larger ones used to run (over $3 with tax). Along with the increased price for less product, as some others have mentioned, the products aren't fresh! This store stays open until 9 PM, but doesn't make products to accommodate that time frame. They are either out of cupcakes or the cupcakes are stale. Eventually I stopped going after 3 PM.It seems that this shop has started focusing on being "cool" and emulating cupcakers on Food Network more than on quality product. Sure, they sell lots of cutesy candies and nice looking cupcakes, but everything is overpriced and I could easily make the same thing at home. If you've got a Pinterest, you can make comparable cupcakes. The only reason I go in anymore is for their absolutely amazing brownies, but sadly those are also starting to decrease in size and increase in price.I've always loved this shop, but they need to revert back to some of their older ways to keep some of their old customers! Go back to Cakes on Walnut!

<Content> I've had the cupcakes here, and I could take them or leave them. On a tip from a friend, I got the salty caramel ice cream. Heaven. I will never go back to ordering cupcakes here. The atmosphere is the definition of twee, which I actually don't mind, but some people are put off by it. I've also never been served promptly here, which seems a bit crazy since they aren't making anything that complicated. Put the cupcake on a plate, scoop the ice cream into a bowl.5 stars for the salty caramel ice cream, 2-3 stars for everything else.

On my first meeting with them they actually let me try some of the flavors that they had, and she even let me try to smore's cupcake she was making for an upcoming wedding. Holy cow, they were good!I've also had their ice cream and their pear moscato ice cream is amazing, definitely try it if it's an option, so light and refreshing.

Not only did they pull it off, they ROCKED it, and the dude who got the cupcakes was super duper happy. The cupcakes themselves were basically nirvana and totally awesome. So really, they are completely a 4-5 star joint--just be warned that they are more expensive than other custom cupcake orders. But, quite honestly, for this level of quality? It is worth it.

Just ignore that, okay?Think of girly things. Fluffy icing and edible pearls and candy butterflies dancing on the sparkling breeze. And fancy say-something hats with bows! Also think of how big your ass is getting. Then immediately push that thought away and think of Christina Hendricks and her juicy rump and decide, mehh, I never really wanted to be a size 2 anyway, so brang on them cuppitycakes! I said BRANG EM I'M STARVINGI had to wait a few hours for an Amtrak train to bring me back from a work trip in Champaign to reality in Chicago. I had a few hours more on my hands than I expected to have, because I thought I'd be doing some rad ass thrifting. However, it turned out that the "vintage" stores in Champaign mostly deal in pilled Fubu sweaters and Express working lady pants from 1997. (Also they're the types of places that sell shit loads of stinky incense cones and chunks of homemade soap they're no doubt hawking for some dread-headed college sophomore named Heaven Jade or something. Why do crappy vintage stores always have that stink stand in the front? Is there EVER some kind of emergency wherein a place doesn't smell bad enough, and a person needs to know where they can get affordable stench in a pinch? "I know! The local vintage store!!") So, disappointed with the cast-offs of U of I students from a million years ago, I set myself up at a table in Cream & Flutter to do some work and have myself a lil treat.The cupcake lifted my spirits like nothing else. So yum and soft. I ate it with a FORK, and I NEVER do that! Then I licked the fork! Also, the personal french press I guzzled in about 6 minutes didn't hurt my mood, either. I was blazing through my inbox and taking no prisoners! And yes, everything was in coffee and sugar all-caps, as in "I AGREE CAN WE GET THIS PROJECT OFF THE GROUND BY OCTOBER 2 WHAT DO YOU THINK OMG WHAT IS HAPPENING NEVERMIND I'M OKAY DID I TYPE THAT I DID OKAY BYE." It was a bit noisy in there as the place has wood floors and loud conversations will make you feel like you're in the gym at your grade school, only as a big person. But points for them not booting me out for lingering, points for the sugarfest, and a kick and a stretch for the cutesy girly interior.If I'd known they had cutesy girly alcoholic beverages, I would have gotten on that train drunk as hell. Oh well, next time. Reach for the stars!

<Content> Came in with my roommate because we were really craving a cupcake. I must say the cupcakes were very tasty, but a bit expensive considering we're not even in the city. Other than that, the place was great and the service was very friendly. I had the dark chocolate cupcake and the whip cream was perfect no so sweet but a perfectly light. I would definitely go back again.

<Content> The name change is a little ridiculous, and I have no idea what is going on with that. Overall, it's pretty good, but I have to admit, I really like the IDEA of C&F rather than its execution. I miss the more frequent cupcake options, and although the gelato is good and the coffee beverages still alright, it's far less awesome than I initially felt when I moved here 3 years ago.

<Content> They offer quality cupcakes in the dead of night! Who else does that? This place is great, and their little desserts are the most unique combinations: Mexican hot chocolate, salted caramel, pistachio passion fruit. I've never seen another place like this and will definitely stop back after a late beer next door at the Blind Pig.

<Content> 1. If you sell cupcakes, have more than three kinds of cupcakes for sale, and more than nine total in the display case. It's a cupcake store. It's not an art gallery. Fill the display case with, oh, I don't know, cupcakes.2. If you sell cupcakes, make sure they taste like cupcakes. Hint: Cupcakes should taste like cakes, not like cardboard cups. Those are cakecups, and are totally different.

<Content> I went in with a friend who needed something else after our meal and awful dessert at Radio Marias (see that review as to why). I wasn't in the mood for more dessert because the cake at Radio Marias made me sick, but it was definitely cute atmosphere. And they put the cupcakes in nice little decorative boxes to go. Lots of unique flavors to try out. They had almost sold out when we got there late at night, so I would recommend during the day for lots of choices. I will definitely be going back to try each and every flavor of cupcake they have. The drinks were a little pricey, but I guess that's to cover the cuteness of the place. I didn't have one yet, but most likely will in the future. And they have an area for outdoor seating in the front to watch the people walk by.

<Content> Beyond disappointed in this place. My husband and I stopped here tonight for an extra special treat for dessert and were both underwhelmed. $3.50+ for a dry cupcake with literally tasteless frosting. At 5 p.m. I don't expect the cupcakes to be fresh from the oven but I don't expect them to be dry either. Sorry to say we won't be trying any more of their products nor will we recommend them to friends.

<Content> In a word, disappointed.My fiance and I tried Cakes on Walnut three times. The first the staff was rude and told us they were closed despite the fact that they technically should have been open for like 5 more minutes.Attempt #2 we entered about an hour or so before closing when we asked for cupcakes they looked at us like we were mental and said they were out. And gave kind of a 'duh' look... Rude to say the least. Not even apologetic that they were completely out of their namesake treat.Final visit. Went in around the same time as our second attempt and.. Victory! They had cupcakes!.. We ordered two. One was the spicy chocolate cupcake with butter-cream frosting and toasted marshmellow. It was gross. DRY. Frosting tasted like pure butter.. spicy chocolate was a decent concept, but poorly executed. The second cupcake we had was phenomenal. Best cupcake I've ever had. It was the smore cupcake, very moist chocolate cake, ooy gooooy marshmellow cream filling, marshmellow frosting and toasted marshmellows on top!! PHENOMENAL!! .. Soo.. Based on this visit alone I would give them 3 stars just because the last cupcake was so freaking amazing..but considering their rude staff, poor service, and the hit or miss treats.. AND the fact that it took us THREE VISITS and two cupcakes to get ONLY ONE GREAT ONE!! ..2 stars is the nicest review i can give...

<Content> Shape up your business model, ladies!! I really wanted you to succeed!1. The cakes don't taste phenomenal -- good, but not great. 2. Don't bother with the coffee, get some across the street for half the price and less sass. 3. The booze? The same beer is down the street for several dollars less. *******************BUT1. The cookies and brownies, though expensive, are wonderful, and are great for portion control (instead of making them at home and eating half the batch).2. That ice cream, though small in portion, is the BEST ice cream I have ever tasted. The most delicately flavored, nuanced, and wonderful ice cream ever. And I'm an ice cream connoisseur.3. Hey, it's a local business with no competition. The prices are bound to be a bit high.

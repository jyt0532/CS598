      "Had a fantastic experience here when I brought my parents. Ordered the free range chicken, fried brussel sprouts and ended with a chocolate desert. The food isn't anything that is uniquely different, but it's really well done. The service here was something that I really appreciated - our waiter was extremely tentative and polite, and was able to do some special changes to our dishes.Really pleased with the ambiance, food and service. Would absolutely go back (with a reservation!)", 
      "Unbelievable. I've only been here once, so my review isn't conclusive, but that one experience I had here was delicious. It's beautiful inside too-- feels like I'm dining in a rustic fairy cave. They were so busy they ran out of half the menu, but, O, \u00a0the food that they did have... I love that the menu is so fresh and that they have so many unique dishes to go with fall. Big Grove isn't *the* tastiest restaurant I've ever been too, but my GOD, it is definitely up there and it definitely trumps any nearby restaurant.", 
      "My wife and I arrived for dinner shortly before six pm on a Saturday and were contemplating sitting inside or out. \u00a0We were advised that if we didn't have a reservation we would be sitting outside or at the bar due to a 45 minute wait. \u00a0Note that at the time we arrived 80% of the tables inside were empty - no problem, we enjoy sitting outdoors. \u00a0Side note: forty-five minutes later there are still twelve empty tables inside...We enjoyed the cumin flavored popcorn and ordered a wedge salad to share. \u00a0The wedge salad needs a little help (extra crumbles please) but the bacon crumbles had a distinct full smokey flavor and were very good. \u00a0We requested salt and pepper and they brought it out in little stainless dishes. \u00a0My wife ordered the scallops and I ordered the flank steak. \u00a0The scallops (four) were exceptionally good - flavorful and delicious. \u00a0The cornbread was just ok. \u00a0The flank steak was marginal but ok - served with delicious sides. \u00a0The wine and beer list is solid - lots of good choices.Good table service - steak could have been brought out hot off the grill but can't have it all. \u00a0My wife was unimpressed overall and mentioned that she was glad we had a gift card and weren't paying menu prices. The atmosphere is upscale overall and the food presentation is excellent. \u00a0The menu options are limited. \u00a0The music is questionably appropriate for dinner but not offensive.", 
      "Definitely my favorite restaurant in champaign. Unique upscale cocktails & food. I love the farm to table concept. Menu changes based on what local foods are in season. I haven't had a bad meal yet. My wife likes to order whatever version of pork belly is on the menu. Something different for the area that you have to check out!", 
      "Great food. \u00a0Friendly staff. Like\"Cheers\", with good food and the pleasure of not having to look at Shelley Long.", 
      "Best restaurant in U-C, hands down. \u00a0Food is creative and tasty, and the menu changes on a regular basis -- I never get bored eating here. \u00a0The waitstaff is incredibly courteous -- I haven't been to a place with better service anywhere in town. \u00a0Prices are in-line for what you get -- I'd argue this place is a bargain seeing what you get at comparably priced restaurants in the area. \u00a0If you are looking for fast food, this ain't your place. \u00a0If you are looking for the best U-C has to offer, this is it!", 
      "This place definitely had a sophisticated feel to it. I definitely was disappointed by the long amount of time it took for us to even get service. However, the bartender was at least friendly and the popcorn was fairly good, if not a little stale. I ordered a Tavern Burger which cost $12. The burger was alright; I always feel a bit jipped when a restaurant burger doesn't include tomatoes in it. It didn't help that they couldn't make two alcoholic beverages that my friend and I asked for. All in all, the hike up in the prices is paying for the atmosphere for the establishment.", 
      "It's been over a year since my first review. Given its popularity, I decided to give this place another chance. Since that initial visit, I have now tried their chicken and dumplings and the skirt steak. The chicken was lovely, moist and well seasoned, the dumplings, however, were a bit of a downer--they were SALTY, small, and sparse, nothing exciting. I might try the dish again, but will have to ask them to be mindful of their salt. The skirt steak was cooked as requested (medium) and was surprisingly tender. I think that they change the accompanying veggies seasonally, but it's always served with a chimichurri (sauce). Given that chimi is one of my favorite sauces, I'll admit that I was skeptical of trying it in Champaign, and was pleasantly surprised--the downfall, they serve it as decorative dots on the plate, rather than a sauce for the meat so there's hardly any of it to enjoy! As you can see, my review of the food has much improved since my first post. I still think that it is overpriced for the portions and location (come on it's Champaign!). My last waitress was pretty good--so service also seems to have improved (or I might've just been lucky).", 
      "Bloody Mary with Stout chaser is a must! \u00a0Delicious applewood smoked bacon and perfectly poached eggs.", 
      "Incredible food, gorgeous setting and excellent service. Micro brew selections are great too. \u00a0I travel/dine out a lot and this was great!", 
      "I stayed across the street on a recent trip and needed to grab a quick lunch. \u00a0I sat at the bar so service was fast. \u00a0The drinks were good and my sandwich was average. \u00a0The interior was nice though and I liked the popcorn they gave me while I waited for my meal.", 
      "The food is over priced, undercooked and extremely salty. So salty that I sent back 2 dinner plates before I just gave up and left. Third time there and been disappointed every time.", 
      "TL;DR: Inconsistent food, at a high price. When they're on, it's great. When they're off, you spend $30-$40 per person on mediocre food. Good atmosphere, good service, good beer.Full review:Based on my two trips to the Big Grove, it seems to be hit or miss.The first time I went, around January of 2014, I was extremely impressed. I had pork belly as an appetizer (amazing) with a Dogfish Head 90 minute to chase it down (the beer selection is pretty great). For dinner, I had a perfectly cooked steak (don't remember the cut), served alongside gnocchi. Everything I ate was relatively simple, but they executed perfectly on the local, farm to table ingredients (they're proud of that here). Service was fantastic.The second time I went, in July 2014, the food was very disappointing. The steak was solid again, but it was served alongside one of the most bitter, poorly cooked broccolini I've ever had the displeasure of tasting. The pork tendorloin was chewy, definitely do not recommend. And this time, the pork belly appetizer was served differently, as a salad. I think it's pretty difficult to screw up pork belly, but they managed to do so. It tasted as if it were cooked a day ago, and it was difficult to find much pork belly beneath the greens. Service was tremendous on both occasions. Our water and popcorn (the popcorn is great) were refilled consistently, and the waiter seemed to take pride in the food.", 
      "Chicken and waffles on Tuesday = The bomb. I eat here all the time. It's absolutely fantastic bomb meal that my mom makes me on the farm. Simple fresh ingredients along with master chef skills.If you like drinking... The patio pounder compliments this immensely.Great staff and service. I love this place.", 
      "Big disappoint. \u00a0Lovely space and ambiance. \u00a0Server was nice and knowledgeable. \u00a0Cheesy grits and Deviled egg was good. \u00a0All 4 entrees were served lukewarm and mediocre for the prices. \u00a0Avoid the pork loin dish. Looked like a proceeded patty. Burger was cold. Filet small and had a bitter green served with it. \u00a0Free range chicken was small but was best of of bunch. \u00a0Dessert menu choices were weird. Would have sent it all back but didn't want to totally ruin dinner.", 
      "We were in town for the football game & looking for a quality place to grab a bite to eat. My wife loves organic & farm to table restaurants & this place did not disappoint. The decor is great & the menu looks like they change it often. The burger is one of the best burgers I have had in a while. The Mac-n-cheese is good, but I would not recommend it as your main course.", 
      "Am here for business and *really* want to give this place a good review, because the food actually is, for the most part, very flavorful. I had the falafel, which was a tad dry, but it's falafel, and this is easy to screw up - forgivable. \u00a0The other dishes were great. \u00a0Excellent turkey sandwich, though the sourdough is a bit airy for my tastes. \u00a0A traditional sourdough needs some ... sourness and doughiness - this really does taste like airy French or Italian bread. The saged popcorn is a nice touch, but I have been here about seven times, and it is always saged popcorn, and the server consistently says \"Our popcorn -today- is fried sage\". ... which to me implies that this will change once in a while. \u00a0In my experience, it does not. Finally, and this has been said *dozens* of times here. \u00a0The prices are completely out of line with Champaign. \u00a0I can get locally sourced ingredients to create a Turkey sandwich and mixed green salad at the local grocery, and a 10oz bottle of the same beer. \u00a0Grand total will be well under $20 with a full six pack and ingredients to spare. My damage for lunch? \u00a0$23 after a modest tip. \u00a0The following day I had a (good) soup of Yellow Beet root and mixed green salad. \u00a0To be clear, we are talking about a CUP of soup and a small plate of salad, for $18. Completely out of touch with the local area and absolutely haranguing customers on the guise of farm-to-table. \u00a0Want to like it based on the food, can't stand to be here based on the price. \u00a0If you're willing to literally incinerate your money, hop on in.", 
      "The service was great. The food and atmosphere I did not care for. I thought their famous deviled eggs were not good at all.", 
      "Great food, price and service. What more could you want?!", 
      "Tried to go here for brunch on a Saturday morning. It was a beautiful day, and we noticed several open tables outside. However when greeted by the hostess, who was incredibly rude, we were told all tables would be filled due to a large party and all others were reserved. When we asked to wait for an occupied table, we were told no. The only tables we were offered were inside where no other customers were sitting.... On such a beautiful day we couldn't justify sitting in a dimly lit, empty restaurant. Luckily there were plenty of other brunch spots across the street who were much more accommodating and friendly. We will never try Big Grove again.", 
      "Hmm...Well...The menu seemed more casual than I expected. The decor & bar area was simple elegance.  Tree branches & Italian lights..Cloth napkins. .but, cheesy grits & popcorn ??!We started out with those cheesy grits. They were not what I envisioned: they were deep fried squares with a green onions on top & a great dipping sauce on the plate . I was expecting a bowl of grits with cheese!! LolTracy was our server, &although she was friendly, \u00a0 she was not informative as to what certain things were on the menu. .. I overheard a black server tell a table about sauces & recommend a wine selection. ..Next..We had the highly recommended Tavern burger. We added the white cheddar. We both had them medium rare. ..my husband thought it was too rare, but I enjoyed it.We passed on the dessert...$5 for vanilla ice cream is a bit much...", 
      "I was glad to see something young and fresh in place of Jim Gould. Gould was boring and dated, but the only option we had in the C-U if you wanted to go to a \"nice\" restaurant. Big Grove Tavern has a casual updated atmosphere with an original concept for the C-U (farm to table). We wanted to go to Destihl (right across from Big Grove) yesterday for lunch, \u00a0but there was a wait and we couldn't wait. We finally had a chance to try Big Grove. There was no wait, and we were seated right away. We were with our 2.5 year old, and \u00a0we have never gone to a kid restaurant. Our daughter is used to dining in grown up restaurants with grown ups, but even the most patient of young foodies could use a quiet distraction while they wait. \u00a0Destihl is not a kids' restaurant, but they have a variety of foods to choose from on the kids' menu and they give the kids crayons to color on the kids' menu. Smart and simple concept that works well. The server at Big Grove said they do not have a kids' menu, but they have \"kid friendly\" options. All they had was grilled cheese and sweet potato fries. I asked if we could just get regular potato fries and the server said \"yes\" so that is what my daughter got. I never understood the whole trend of replacing delicious french fries with sweet potato fries--they don't taste better nor are they \"healthier\" or much lower in calories. If you are going to eat fries make them from potatoes not sweet potatoes. I wanted to order a burger, but all their burger options are a blend of beef, bison and pork and I don't want to eat bison so I ordered the Black Bean Burger. \u00a0My husband ordered \"The Baltimore\"which is basically a BLT with avocados. My daughter's fries had more salt than there is in salt. Maybe it was just that day, but someone went really heavy handed with the salt. My Black Bean Burger was really good. It's not what I wanted to eat, but if you are vegetarian (I have been on and off for years) this was delicious. My husband's order was okay. It's a BLT with avocado. Why take a classic and add something that adds nothing? The server was great--very nice person and efficient. The design and layout of the restaurant is great. Casual and open. Trying to be a gastropub, but misses the mark with the menu. It's still a big step up for the C-U in terms of dining options. I liked this place. I like the concept, the layout, the service, but the menu is not for me. The food is not bad, but not great. Too many options like a classic burger or BLT are turned into things that are trying too hard to be \"cheffie\", but miss the mark. I just wish they didn't try to reinvent the wheel on these American food classics. If they're going to reinvent the classics they better make them better than the original. I would have liked to see a few classics taken up a notch with a gourmet twist or just a few classics done really well. Overall Big Grove is worth a try, but I wouldn't highly recommend it or anything because the food options are limited and the food tastes okay. Not great, just okay.", 
      "I was a bit disappointed by Big Grove Tavern. \u00a0I came in with a group of friends for lunch one day, and while the service was nice, the environment fine, the food was just completely underwhelming.I ordered the burger for lunch, with a side salad. \u00a0The burger was incredibly difficult to eat, and not due to excessive size, or the usual suspects. \u00a0I added an egg for 1.50, which turned out to be a mistake. \u00a0Although the flavors were OK, the bun just wasn't able to hand and got soggy, the burger decomposing as I ate it. \u00a0The proportions were off, and the lack of spectacular taste just made the meal messy with no upside. \u00a0The lettuce was completely wilted under the burger and the onions were entirely too sweet.Similarly, the salad was unfortunate. \u00a0Too much dressing and an overly generous hand of salt and citrus made the salad too salty and sour.For the entire meal, I paid $17 including tax and tip, which is OK for a downtown area. \u00a0However, I'd suggest that you check one of the other places around if you're looking for a solid burger.", 
      "The tavern burger tastes average. \u00a0Service is kind of slow.", 
      "I have had about 6 meals here, I live across the street so why not right. A couple Brunches, a couple chill lunches, and a few dinners. There is just always something. For the cost, (I understand that the locally sourced produce and meats are high quality and going to cost more) but for the cost... I just never feel that the meal hits the mark. No a quantity thing. I do love the servers, I dig the drinks, and the layout is pretty upscale/casual. Go, enjoy. I\"m not being a hater. You will most likely have a great meal.", 
      "I went there for Sunday brunch (for the first time) and it's a nice place. There were only about 4 brunch entrees available on the rotating menu, and only 1 jumped out at me as sounding undeniably delicious (I played it safe with eggs, bacon, and potatoes). They didn't even have an omelette, which was very surprising (and a bit disappointing).Let me say though, the bacon was cooked to perfection. Lots of taste and not too crispy. Potatoes were surprisingly tasty, and the eggs were eggs. Service was impeccable: there are few places that keep up with how much water I drink.I thought for such a basic dish it was a little pricey at $10, but I must admit that it was really well done.So my three star comes down to...+ flavor+ service+ bacon powdered popcorn- price- selection", 
      "So fun and trendy and industrial inside this place! I knew the second I walked in that I would like this place. Definitely my scene.Started with their fried brussels sprouts (also a trendy food item on top of the trendy decor! theme??) with tuffle aioli and sea salt and nothing like a little sea salt to push a dish over! These things were addicting. I shared a little, but not much! Gotta love some good brussel sprouts. I still don't get why kids hate these things so much???Then since I ate vegetables to start like a good kid (I know, yes they were fried, but come on, let me have my cake and it too, okay?), I thought that granted me the ability to get their mac and cheese in a little oven baked dish packed with tons of cheese, bacon, leeks, fried shallots, and then as it should be, topped with crumbled bread crumbs! Mmmmmm that mac and cheese was exactly how I like my mac and cheese! Hot, creamy, cheesy, goodness. Done and done. Plus they had a good beer selection here too, the only thing I think that was missing was more attentive service since I would have ordered more beer if they had come around more quickly and the water service, but pretty minor! I definitely would come back here if I visited again!", 
      "Everything was just alright. I had the burger and the gin hopper cocktail which was 80% gin. It was very strong and not as flavorful as I thought itd be. Also my waitress was kinda weird, I think she just wanted me to get out of there asap...not welcoming at all. Would not go back.", 
      "Coming from CA I have pretty high standards when a restaurant states they are a farm to table. Big Grove didn't disappoint. Dinner menu was small but had a nice variety. The roasted beets were phenomenal. Looking forward to trying Sunday brunch here in the future.", 
      "The locally available food here is great! We've had some of our favorite dishes here! The only downside of having a variable menu based on only the freshest locally available ingredients is that sometimes, the options aren't that great and can feel over priced for the quality. Also, their beer is way overpriced but I guess that's okay.I recommend seeing what dishes they have available before you go. They always have a rotating menu.", 
      "I got the chicken sandwich with mixed greens. I felt like I was given a really small portion of chicken and the mixed greens that came with did not have a very exciting dressing or added flavor. The sandwich overall tasted fine, just wasn't very filling which for $10 makes me leave the table a bit unhappy. The popcorn that tastes like fruit loops was cool.", 
      "Came here for a special on chicken and waffles. First of all, amazing. Buttery waffles with garlic-marinated collard greens and free range chicken. We also started off with the chicken liver pate. Incredibly smooth and paired well with a side of seared pears atop freshly toasted, thick country bread. Did I mention the pickled onions? That sealed the deal.Service here...incredible. From our host to our waiters, each staff member stepped out of their way to be easygoing and amicable. I had several lovely conversation about food with the knowledgeable people who work here.Beautiful interior as well, quite chic with a rustic edge (look at those antler/ branch chandeliers). Wide open space with gorgeous, intimate lighting.The only thing I wish I could change? The price. Alas, great portions with an equally robust price. The special, in particular, did not have a price listed. Be sure to come here for a celebration or special event, it's quite lovely.", 
      "Two of us randomly decided to try Big Grove Tavern after having some beers at nearby Quality Beer. I was pleasantly surprised how great the whole experience was.On Monday night they had a nice pre fixe menu for $50 with shared appetizer, soup/salad, entree, and shared dessert. Otherwise I could see dinner getting pricey here fast. We started with the Brussels sprouts which were lightly fried and not as oily as most fried sprouts. I could eat these all day.We tried a couple of deviled eggs and they fact that you can order them one apiece for $1 is nice if you just want a taste. Pretty standard, but tasty as most deviled eggs (to me) usually are. The cauliflower soup was nice as well. A bit plainer tasting than butternut squash soup, but I would still order it again with some toasted almonds. The steak entree was cooked perfectly though they never asked how I wanted it cooked. Glad they read my mind and got the medium rare cook correct. Root veggies were good too.I wasn't in love with the rice pudding, though it's not usually my thing. I didn't think it actually had rice in it...Though I don't get to Champaign too often, I would easily recommend it for someone looking for a good farm to table restaurant. Especially Mondays!", 
      "I've been here a four times. \u00a0I want to love this place, but can't quite get there.Pros: *Drinks- very good. \u00a0We had a watered down old fashioned once, but other than that one experiences, the drinks have been interesting and tasty.*Good, friendly service. \u00a0Sometimes it is a little slow, but servers are always friendly and do their best for you.The So-So: *menu tends towards fancified home cooking, which is not a bad thing. \u00a0But given that, it seems a bit overpriced for what you get. \u00a0The food we've had as been consistently okay, but not amazing. \u00a0Dinner? \u00a0Okay. \u00a0Brunch (which I really, really wanted to love)? \u00a0Again, just okay. \u00a0If you don't cook a lot at home, this can be a great place for you. \u00a0If you are a successful and inventive home cook, you might not be as impressed. \u00a0Con:**This is the thing that makes me not want to give Big Grove another chance. \u00a0We were in about 6 months ago (August), and both ordered the burger. \u00a0We requested some tomato to go with it, and the waitress came back- somewhat sheepishly, to her credit- and told us that the kitchen didn't serve it with tomato. \u00a0Okay. \u00a0I've been to fine dining restaurants, and I understand that chefs conceptualize the flavors of a dish in a particular way, and that's the way they want you to experience it. \u00a0But a burger? \u00a0And, more importantly, this burger? \u00a0It's fine, but it's not all that. \u00a0Perhaps they were just out of tomatoes? \u00a0But anyway, the fact that they were so proud of this burger keeps gnawing at me. \u00a0Overall:*Good drinks, fine ambience, good service. \u00a0In the greater scheme of things, they are still fairly new, so maybe they'll continue to evolve? \u00a0I hope so, because I'd love to see them reach a little bit higher; there seems to be potential for more here.", 
      "Pretty good, local food.Make sure to try the olive oil and sea salt ice cream!", 
      "I visited with my mom on my birthday back in October, and it was absolutely the right choice. Our server was as friendly as could be and gave great suggestions for our meal. The cocktail she recommended to me- I think it was called a Georgia Peach?- was yummy, though it tasted much more like melon than peach. The Seared Pork Belly was totally decadent- buttery, full of umami flavor and perfectly crisp on the outside. Mom got the Faroe Islands Salmon, which was excellently cooked, though the lentils were a touch under-salted. We shared the Apple and Pear Crisp for dessert, which was delicious as well, but my entree really won the night.I ordered the Roasted Mushroom and Poached Farm Egg. I'd originally planned on the Mac n Cheese, but our waitress persuaded me to give the egg dish a shot, and I am so incredibly happy I did. The egg was poached impeccably, and when the yolk broke over those grits, I nearly wept. Everything about it, from concept to execution, was excellent. The grits were rich and creamy, the mushrooms were delightfully earthy and tender, and whatever they did to that sauce was magical. I honestly feel a little depressed that I'll never get to eat it again. It keeps me up at night.On second thought, maybe I should give them 1 star, because they ruined my life with their amazing food. Thanks a lot, guys.", 
      "I really like brunch at Big Grove! \u00a0The chicken hash and chili scramble are great; the cinnamon roll was nothing special. \u00a0The servers are nice, and the booths are comfy. I also love that they source their food locally!", 
      "Nice large restaurant with a nice atmosphere and interesting menu. The food was good but could've been much better with additional attention to the texture. Tavern burger: Mix of beef, bison & pork burger with a red onion marmalade and cornichon aioli. The meat was alright in texture and flavor but was overpowered by the marmalade.Turkey Horseshoe: Turkey sandwich with beer mustard, 3-cheese mornay cheese sauce, and mixed greens. The mix of mustard flavor and turkey was a good mix.Trout hash: Nice clean flavors with a mix of nice vegetable elements such as corn and green onion.Deviled egg: Good texture with nice crispy chip but wasn't a huge fan of the yolk.Spiced nuts: Fresh and tasty, nothing unusual from other good spiced nuts however.Fresh baked soft pretzel: Nice mustard but the pretzel itself was a bit tough.Cornbread: Nice corn flavor and texture, one of the best items of the meal.Overall, a nice choice if you're not visiting Desithl nearby but a little pricey.", 
      "That Tavern Burger sure is memorable! \u00a0It was pretty packed on a Friday evening, so we had to sit at the bar or wait 20 minutes for a table. \u00a0For drinks, my S.O. had two 20 oz. Schlafly K\u00f6lsch and I tried the Cherry Wheat. \u00a0The draft of Schafly was the way to go. \u00a0Along came two delightful, Deviled Eggs. \u00a0It was superb when paired with the pickled pepper relish. \u00a0I almost went with the Seared Walleye, but decided to indulge on a burger with my bf instead. \u00a0I've never had a combination of beef, bison, and pork. \u00a0Both were cooked to a perfect medium. \u00a0However, he ordered his with the additions Amish white cheddar and a fried egg, with the marmalade and aioli on the side. \u00a0I ordered mine with everything and a fried egg. \u00a0The red onion marmalade was amazing! \u00a0I was eating my fries with the bf's side portion. \u00a0Next time, I'm asking for extra! \u00a0It was so messy, but well worth the lean-in at the bar. \u00a0I almost forgot! \u00a0The seasoned fries were crispy and well-portioned.",

      "I decided on Big Grove after driving around Champaign for a few minutes, and I wasn't disappointed.It was a really nice day out, and since I parked in a nearby lot, I had to decide between here and Destihl. I looked at both menus, and frankly, because big grove was second, I stayed there. I opted to sit outside, in the sun. It was not bad at all.Onto the \u00a0experience... first of all, my waitress was great and very attentive. Each table gets a little bowl of popcorn to start, which is cool. Anyways, their menu is locally sourced, and quite small. They have a few appetizers, and I indulged in two of them. I had a deviled egg (dollar per), and I also ordered the pickled vegetables (radish, onion, fennel, and carrot). The deviled egg came with a rye crisp and sauteed red onions. It was okay, and I'm glad I only ordered one. On the other hand, the pickled vegetables were fantastic! A little pricey at 3 dollars, but definitely the highlight of my meal.For my main course, I ordered the pork, bison, and beef burger. I had the aioli and red onion marmelade on the side. I like my burgers medium. I also ordered mine on whole grain bread instead of the standard bun.The burger was average. It was not cooked medium well, and there was some yellow sauce (not the aioli, but possibly a mustard) that ended up on my burger, even though I asked for my burger plain. My mixed greens salad with the vinagrette was good. My second favorite part, and I'm not a salad fan at all.Overall, a decent place. Nothing special. My bill was 17 dollars, and I did not order a drink or anything. I like the feel of the restaurant, but honestly, I'll probably go somewhere else in the area before I head back here.", 
      "I have never been to the MIdwest--except 3 days in Chicago in heat and humidity so intense I remember almost nothing--but can say without question that this restaurant would be a hit even in NYC or LA. I ate here twice on a visit, once for lunch and once for dinner, and was initially struck by the sheer beauty--and size--of the restaurant. It gets crazy busy on a Friday night and appears to be the only upscale bar in the area.Recommended dishes: 1) Veggie mac and cheese2) Chili: cup or bowl, cornbread on the side3) Lake Trout (I don't even like trout--it's my least favorite fish, likely because I have only had river trout with the bones and almonds and butter, but this was sublime with horseradish sauce)4) Pate which rivals the best I've eaten and is my personal favorite because it's mousse-like and light and not too heavy/strong but still exquisitely flavorful: it's better than the chicken livers at the Public Kitchen at Hollywood and served almost identically at a far lower price5) Fried grits--I know, this doesn't sound good at all but it has a chipotle aioli and for a decadent fried treat, you can't do better. I didn't know much about grits, as an LA girl, but apparently you can cook them without much fat and then unceremoniously dump a big hunk of butter on top so that it's like cream of wheat with butter, or you can do it more like the French with butter and cream, in which case it's far worse for you but tastes infinitely better. Executive chef Jessica Gorin subscribes to the second school of grit preparation and I wholly approve. 5) Beets: they were as good as the Purple Pig in Chicago but this is a \"bar bite\" (see below) so if you want a large portion, order two. 6) Chocolate bread pudding: this dessert rivals the Olio e Limone chocolate bread pudding with bananas which Julia Child cited as among her favorite desserts in Santa Barbara7) Pork belly: this has become trendy of late and some restaurants are pulling it from menus in big cities as people seem to be over it to some extent but Big Grove Tavern hits it out of the park with this appetizer. 8) Burger: some people in the area carped about the price of the burger here, not realizing that this is standard in LA and NYC (actually, their burger is cheaper than most fine dining burgers in cities I travel or live) and it's sheer perfection with the onions and cheese. The prices are reasonable and they offer a sort of mini-appetizer they call a \"bar bite,\" for 3 to 5 dollars. This is a nice option as you can try all sorts of sides for not a lot of money. The watercress soup was beautiful and subtle but the only dish on the menu that didn't send me into another galaxy. I truly believe Big Grove Tavern would be a hit in a city. In Champaign, which is a college town that feels infinitely smaller than it really is, with very few fine dining options, I see why the place is booming and if I lived in this tiny place, I'd eat here three times a week.", 
      "The food here is always fresh. Seasonal menus are great. I wish there were more vegetable options, but the brussels sprouts are amazing. Drinks are good and the desserts are really nice. All in all, a wonderful place to eat out in Champaign.", 
      "I went here again after being in town. \u00a0I tried their special.. a squid ink risotto with clams. \u00a0Frankly didn't like it. \u00a0Not too much taste and I love squid ink!!! \u00a0Oh well... The wine selection was good though. \u00a0The popcorn is probably the best part of the meal. \u00a0Oh well.. **************************************************\u00ad**************************I was more impressed with this place than I thought I would be...It takes the place of the old steakhouse I used to frequent back in the day when I used to be a college student.The place has had a face lift.. a bar in the center and tables on the side. \u00a0Their concept is farm raised food. \u00a0So their menu is really never the same. \u00a0Tried a few things.. their cocktail menu was okay. \u00a0I tried a strawberry bourbon one was good but then I switched to an old fashioned which was really gross.Tried their roasted tomato soup which was really way too sour for something like that. Usually it's more sweet after being cooked for so long.. so I am not sure what was going on. \u00a0I also tried the trout that the waiter told me was popular. \u00a0I wasn't the biggest fan of the cream sauce. \u00a0I like the vegetables.. well the farm veggies.My companion had the filet which looked good but I didn't try it. Definitely better than Destihl in my opinion.. Champaign downtown is growing up.. still has quite a way to rival major smaller cities.", 
      "I went here with my parents one night. \u00a0I love downtown Champaign, there are plenty of interesting and very good restaurants around. \u00a0Not to mention lots of very good beer bars. \u00a0This place tries to combine the two with a small but well constructed tap list and a small locally sourced menu. \u00a0My parents have been here a few times, and warned me of the downfalls (slow service, running out of menu items). \u00a0Well, I always have to check a new place out and see for myself. \u00a0After our visit, I had to apologize and thank them for humoring me.Anyway, a large open room with an island bar. \u00a0The light fixtures look like Christmas lights bought at Farm & Fleet. \u00a0The sticks on the ceiling look like they were bought at Hobby Lobby.We were seated right away, which was a good sign. \u00a0Though besides the fancy popcorn we were ignored for a long time. \u00a0I hate to be the person to say service was slow, cause it was a busy night. \u00a0I can deal with slow, but no acknowledgement what so ever was not good. \u00a0Incredibly slow kitchen times as well.We finally put our drink and food orders in at the same time. \u00a0We were not sure when we would get another chance. \u00a0I liked their beer selection. \u00a08 taps of good micros. \u00a0Though they were out of four taps. \u00a0Half of their selection was out. \u00a0I like it when a place can go through kegs and rotate the selection, though no. \u00a0They would rather just not have half the selection. \u00a0Out of Great Lakes, out of Founders, out of Dark Horse, out of Victory. \u00a0I ended up with a Sculpin, and my Dad a Goose Island 312. \u00a0If you are going to have a small selection, you need to keep it stocked.The menu was similarly small, but looked good. \u00a0My Dad ended up with the last burger, which is a mix of beef, bison, and pork. \u00a0Sounds great. \u00a0He has tried to eat here before, twice actually. \u00a0Both times out of the burger, so it was good that he finally got to try it. \u00a0 Again, it is good that they can go through the menu like that. \u00a0Though it is tiring when they keep running out. \u00a0I had the pork sausage, my Mom Mac & Cheese. \u00a0It is a tiny menu for dinner, about 5 main courses. \u00a0I love when a place can do that. \u00a0Just not enough here to pull that off. \u00a0Especially when they run out of stuff. On top of that, not much here was that great. \u00a0The burger was decent, Mac & Cheese cold, and the sausage was poorly executed with little flavor. \u00a0They shout from every corner that everything is fresh and local. \u00a0Fine, but make it good.This is one of my longest reviews, and I guess it is this way because I had very high hopes and little was as expected. \u00a0Though I was told before hand that everything was slow, over priced, pretentious, not that good, and often out. \u00a0This place just left me wanting so much more.", 
      "I've eaten here a few times, and every time have left satisfied. \u00a0My favorite was the brunch! \u00a0Their beer, wine and mixed drink selections are great! \u00a0Overall the atmosphere inside and menu are great. \u00a0A little more than I'd like to spend on a dinner, but it's nice for a special occasion. \u00a0I would recommend the burger or anything on the brunch menu! \u00a0Their menu changes with the season which is great!", 
      "Great location, nice atmosphere, great spot for eating outdoors.We initially had to wait on a table and had a drink at the bar. \u00a0They have a good beer selection, although the bartender that helped us was a little bit \"too cool for school\" :) When we were seated at a table outside our waiter was extremely helpful, nice and attentive. \u00a0Big Grove's thing is \"Fresh Farm-to-Table\" and they don't disappoint. \u00a0There are a lot of interesting dishes on the menu and everything we tried was good.I recommend the fried cheesy grits- really good. The mac and cheese was a tad disappointing for me- too heavy on the bread crumbs.Overall a nice experience- we will definitely go again!", 
      "The service was very good and the restaurant itself was nice and relaxing. The food on the other hand was hit-or-miss. The Brussel sprouts and french fries were delicious, but the tavern burger and grilled chicken fingers were ordinary. A big killer was the small portion size of the salads. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this as a place to go to in Champaign if you haven't been to the likes of Seven Saints.", 
      "The best thing about this place is that everything on the menu is locally sourced from the veggies to the meats. The bison burger is by far my favorite! What makes it so great is you can taste the freshness of each of the ingredients in every dish. Each option is carefully crafted to display the perfect balance or flavors. The menu options do change due to seasonal availability for veggies/fruit which means there is always something new to try! While the prices are a little bit higher than other sit down places, it is definitely worth it.", 
      "Was here for my siblings UI's graduation lunch. \u00a0They had a special menu and the wait was a little long. \u00a0That being said, the service was still excellent and the food was outstanding. \u00a0The flavored popcorn at the table was a welcome treat. \u00a0I hade the filet, which was cooked to perfection. \u00a0Great atmosphere to celebrate a graduation!", 
      "A great place for brunch but also a place with a refreshing philosophy of using as many fresh, local ingredients as possible. The brunch menu changes weekly, so you will always have new exciting options. Some favorites of mine are the fried Brussels sprouts with truffle aioli, chilled beets with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, deviled eggs and to drink, the Glider. My husband loves the tavern burger. An added bonus is the little tins of fresh popcorn - a particularly good flavor of the day was bacon-coffee popcorn. It was mind-boggling how good that popcorn was! They have great specials, too. Enjoy!", 
      "This came very well reviewed on Yelp and Open table. Hey! Its a Tavern! How bad could it be? I was wrong...I was down in the U of I area during homecoming and made a reservation just in case it was packed for an early dinner. When we arrived, the place was empty. We were taken to our table and given this small one page menu. I thought it was the drink menu, but no, it was the dinner menu. A bit suprised, I asked my father if he would rather go to DESTIL across the street, but he wanted to try this new local joint. We decided that I was going to get the \"famous\" burger and my dad was going to get the Mac and Cheese. Our server came over and my dad started by ordering the Mac and Cheese, but he asked if he could get it without the onions (shallots and leeks). He was told NO because they already have it premixed. Premixed? She assured him that there was not alot of onions so we continued. For $12 on the burger and $14 for the Mac and Cheese, we were expecting something spectacular. My burger came out. It was a mix of bison, beef, and pork. I was expecting something very flavorful. It was bland as could be. Also, it was about 1/8 of a pound. One of the smallest burgers I have ever eaten. The fries that came with this was good, but the dish was not worth it. My dad's Mac and Cheese came out in a small bowl and half of it was made up of shallots and leeks. I tasted it and thought that it was good, but he HATED it. We had the manager called over and he took it away and took it off of the bill without us asking. He asked if we wanted something else, but my dad complained that the menu was too small for him to go with anything else. Instead of apologizing, the manager told him \"well its all local\" and he walked away. Our server was nice, but I could overhear the hostess and the manager talking about future reservations for the night with an attitude and snarky responses to each other. People can hear you folks! \u00a0It was as if they were doing us a favor by being open. In short, skip this place and go to other places within a block of this place. They know how to treat their customers and not to overcharge. I would suggest Guido's!", 
      "Thank god for this place. That's really all I can say. Well no, I can say more. But before I get to the meat of my review, no pun intended, let me say that Big Grove Tavern is exactly what this town needed. When Jim Gould's closed I was sad to see it go but what has come in it's place is something really fantastic. From the food to the interior to the crowd, the energy Big Grove gives off is infectious and demonstrates that the confluence of intellect and small-town charm in Champaign can really lead to something amazing.Now on to the food:Popcorn: Come for free as a starter. While I was hoping for bread, I was even happier with this. The popcorn really whets your appetite without being too filling. I hear the flavor changes; it was definitely some kind of lime (think the hint of lime you find certain Mexican foods) flavor when I was there.Tavern Burger: There are so many things I can say about the Tavern Burger. First and most simply, it's delicious. The blend of bison was for me, the most prominent of the three meats that make up the burger but overall I found it to be rich, meaty and just the right amount of gamey given the bison. The onion marmalade, and petite crusty bun complimented the burger without overpowering the taste of the meat. I opted to add the fried egg which led to messy experience given the soft yolk, but a certainly more delicious one. At this point, if I did this right, you are so convinced about the deliciousness of the burger you won't even care to hear about the fries. But hey, if you're still interested: they're completely well-executed- crisp yet still potatoey. Now... onto my other comment on the Tavern Burger. There was some review on here about how the burger is in limited quantities. That's how you know it's fresh and locally sourced! If I wanted something from a freezer I'd head down by the mall and swallow some hormone-laced, bacon-cheese-blue cheese-fried onion-black forest-ham-ranch dressing-heart attack in a bun. If you want a burger that satisfies your burger craving while still being an appreciable entree and cut of meat, come enjoy the Tavern Burger. And if you've missed it, just come back and try again! And frankly, at 12 bucks, it's not that bad. The downtown Champaign restaurant scene generally errs on the more expensive side. Given what Jim Gould's prices used to be like, Big Grove is far more reasonable price-wise in comparison. In sum, ignore the hate, embrace the love, Big Grove will have you leaving full, happy and pleasantly surprised by what Champaign has to offer food-wise.", 
      "Big Grove is fine, but that's all it is. \u00a0Unfortunately it just doesn't make sense to pay $15 for just a good hamburger. \u00a0If it were less expensive; maybe more in line with Blackdog or Dublin O'Neils prices it may have gotten 4 stars (whereas those other restaurants get 5 stars and 4 stars respectively). We started off with some deviled eggs that were good, and a fresh baked pretzel that had an unappealing mustard sauce. \u00a0I'll take Gulden's over that mustard sauce any day. \u00a0I ordered the burger and my girlfriend ordered a chicken salad sandwich.The burger was actually pretty good, cooked medium, with an egg and some onion maramalade on it. \u00a0The fries were decent but nothing to write about.The chicken salad was just a terrible sandwich. \u00a0Maybe one small scoop of flavorless chicken salad on hard toast for $9? \u00a0Get that thing off the menu. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0People who order that sandwich will not come back. \u00a0 The sweet potato chips on the side were pretty tasty though.Overall, not as great as I had hear, though maybe the chicken salad ruined the experience. \u00a0You want a burger, go to Blackdog or Farrens for a comparable one that costs half the price. \u00a0Want chicken salad better than this, go to your local gas station and buy a pre-made chicken salad.All that said, I'll give it another try.", 
      "Big Grove is a ditz. Nice to look at, but there's nothing really there.Take the menu for example. It's the size of the bill, just more upsetting. All six inches of it, beautifully fastened to the silver rings of a time-worn clipboard, boast an incredible twelve total items - including appetizers and drinks. Or something like that.What about the food, you say? Good question. The portions are tiny. There is one steak on the menu - a hanger steak. You just always leave feeling let down.", 
      "Good food. \u00a0Were facinated by the bar bits and starters, so decided to go with a nosh dinner had smelts, pickeled veggies, pate, parsnip and celery root soup, deviled eggs, chopped salad, and mac cheese. \u00a0All the food was good and for a newly opened restaurant the service was amazingly together. \u00a0We even had a wine by the glass which was corked and they fixed it without problem. \u00a0The wine list was not deep, but what they had was reasonably priced.All in all if you were looking for a gastro-pub in Champaign, this fits the bill.", 
      "A place worth trying. Had brunch there and the baked potatoes were very good. Gotta visit next time", 
      "The appetizers and my seared tuna were awesome!", 
      "A welcome addition to downtown Champaign. The menu is unique and changes often. They strive to use locally-sourced ingredients and the wait-staff has been nothing but friendly and helpful. Every dish that I've eaten there has been absolutely melt-in-you-mouth fantastic. Seriously, try the roast chicken. They also offer a selection of house cocktails that are very tasty. Prices are about on par with the other \"fancier\" restaurants downtown which is to say that you can easily get an entr\u00e9e and a drink for between $15 and $25. You can certainly spend more and if you try, you can get out for under $10 a head.The atmosphere feels relaxed and trendy, the decor is pretty awesome, and I have to say that I love their music selection. It's current and recognizable without being overplayed or desperately obscure. Big Grove is high on my list if I feel like having a nice dinner.", 
      "Everything But the Bun!Everything at this restaurant was excellent - except the hamburger bun.I enjoyed the open space, the furnishings, the art on the walls, the overall feel of the place. \u00a0The staff was excellent - friendly, helpful with menu selections, and accommodating. The menu itself is charming - and the attention to the farm-to-table detail is commendable. There's seasoned popcorn on the table - a nice touch. I tried the very economical \"If It's From The Vine It's Fine\" daily wine special, which was quite a brilliant surprise for the price. I would recommend this to anyone. The take on a wedge salad - using bibb lettuce - was inspired. I was surprised there was no bread served with the salad. And, while I realize this is the chef's preference, I wanted some to sop up a little of the salad's very tasty creamy herb vinaigrette. And so I asked for some bread. And received some lovely bread to accompany the salad. For a main I ordered the Tavern Burger - a monster of beef, bison & pork, red onion marmalade, cornichon aioli - and served with house-cut fries. The fries were great! A bit less greasy version of those fantastic greasy kind of fries you get from a hot dog stand. Super good. As was the burger - the marmalade - and the cornichon aioli. Everything was perfect except...the bun! - Which was so bland and tough and flavorless, I tossed it to the side and knife and forked the burger.I'm sure, if I brought this detail to the staffs attention, they would have somehow taken care of things - they were nice that way. So I can only fault myself for not making an issue of it then. But man - compared to everything else - that was so great - that bun was a letdown. Regardless, I highly recommend Big Grove Tavern.", 
      "This was my second time at Big Grove and it was a great experience. First off, our server, Carolyn provided great service, regularly checking in \u00a0with us to see if we needed anything else (service is a little like the Three Bears' beds, too much, too little, or just right and Carolyn provided the right amount) and provided well-articulated descriptions of the menu items. Although the portion sizes seemed a bit off (the carb to main item ratio seemed a bit off for both my friend and my dishes) the food was flavorful and the desserts (vanilla ice cream and the olive oil cake) were delicious and worth sticking around for. We opted to eat out on the patio and so, the combination of good food, old friends, great weather and awesome service made for a great lunch break.", 
      "Thanks to Big Grove we have a fine dining establishment that bases their menu on fresh and local ingredients. \u00a0I went there with my husband for our anniversary, but I can easily see going back for a more casual meal, or even for drinks and bar snacks. \u00a0Every table starts with slightly sweet popcorn and we were promptly visited by our friendly and helpful wait staff. \u00a0We had the chicken liver pate, bistro filet, house made sausage, and the tater tots. \u00a0Everything we tasted was delicious! \u00a0I can't wait to go back and work my way through the menu.", 
      "I know the whole local concept is hip right now, but Big Grove does it right. \u00a0Plus the interior is cool, with open space and interesting visual detail (the branches on the ceiling). \u00a0And our waiter was on his game with recommendations and satisfying our motley crew's numerous requests.Our group started with deviled eggs all around. \u00a0I tried to take a couple bites, but dang, it was good! \u00a0I would have ordered another but our food came pretty quickly after. \u00a0Deviled egg doggy bag anyone... or just me?I had the turkey sandwich, which had so much flavor for a turkey sandwich! \u00a0Loved the bread, the cheese, the spreads. \u00a0Also ordered at our table was the Tavern Burger (which looked like a big, juicy meatball) and the chicken sandwich.Their menu looks different now, which means rotating sandwich toppings and mains = never gets boring. \u00a0Their salads, bar snacks and starters all look amazing this time around too.I plan to make this a regular lunch spot when I'm in the area. \u00a0Maybe dinner too, so I can try one of their fun sounding cocktails!", 
      "Great atmosphere, friendly people, and tasty food!I'm new to Chambana and there are so many new food places to try. \u00a0I decided to make my way through the best rated establishments and try not to repeat any before finishing. \u00a0However, I think I'll have to break my rule for this place and head back soon.Everything was very good but its the little things that stand out for me. \u00a0The deviled eggs were prepared to a different culinary level than I'd ever tasted before. \u00a0Unexpected and great!", 
      "Big Grove Tavern is pretty much the same food concept as the restaurant across the street (Destihl). The only difference is that Big Grove Tavern is good.I really hate hipsters. Like, some of the stuff that comes out of their mouths actually angers me. So I was not too eager to come to this place thats all \"local, farm to table, blah blah blah.\" Because a lot of times thats a hipster excuse for mediocre tasting food. I dont care if its local or organic or any of that. I just want it to be tasty!! When we walked in I was like... here we go. The OC soundtrack is playing, the menu comes on little clipboards with the farms listed on it, and there is no salt or pepper shakers on any of the tables. It seemed pretentious to me. But for the most part, everything I tried here was tasty.We had the fried cheesy grits, french fries with malt vinegar aioli, and pickled veggies for an appetizer. I didn't try the vegetables because pickled stuff is not for me. The other two passed the test.For dinner, I ordered the macaroni and cheese. In retrospect I wish I would have ordered the vegetarian version because there was so much bacon in this that it actually took away from the goodness of the cheese. But +1 for it being piping hot.The rest of the family had a pork tenderloin, beef short rib, and burger. I tasted the short rib and the burger- the rib was a little salty but still good. The burger was flavorful but for me (and this is just a personal preference) the mixture of meats made it a little too soft.We did have dessert- Gooey butter cake and a chocolate pot-de-creme. The butter cake fell a little short. I was expecting it to be warm and gooey. It was cold, not gooey, but still rich. The pot-de-creme, was... *kisses fingers like an italian chef* Perfectly bittersweet, rich rich rich, and topped with vanilla whipped cream that I could see the little vanilla speckles in. Nom.Our server was really cool and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job. He kept referring to the chef as \"chef,\" like \"chef makes this, and chef did that\" which was kind of irksome, just because its like... you're in Champaign IL, chef. Come back down to earth a little.", 
      "I wouldn't call it a Tavern... I'd put it more in the upscale gastropub category. \u00a0Tavern implies dark, cozy, slightly antiqued. \u00a0Big Grove is open, airy and modern.The food was good but not phenomenal, but the drinks were great -- and thoughtfully recommended by our waitress, who was nothing short of fantastic. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0I so often wish I'd kept track of servers' names, but this one I seriously regret because she deserves a wonderful review directly to her manager.I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm in town.", 
      "Everything was wonderful from the service to the food. We had the filet and the chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Would definitely recommend Big Grove Tavern, it will become a regular dinner destination for us!", 
      "My coworker and I came for an early evening dinner. We both enjoyed the atmosphere and a few drinks. Extremely friendly service. The popcorn that you start off with was tasty. I loved my blackberry rum infusion. For dinner, the roasted chicken was amazing. Would definitely return if in the area again.", 
      "On Wednesday, July 11th a group of seven of us went for dinner. After a week of oppressive heat we were happy to be able to enjoy the weather and sit outside. It was great. We started with the tater tots and deviled eggs for appetizers. I loved the tater tots. They're not your typical frozen tots. They had some kind of apple puree sauce on the plate. Initially, I was skeptical, potato and apple together? It was delicious though. Holy cow. I really enjoyed that. I wish more than 4 came in an order though. The deviled eggs were nice, also. I really got a lot of the sweet pea flavor. It sounds odd but it was great and added a freshness to the egg. For dinner, several of us got the burger. Ohhhh my gosh. It was great. Cooked to the perfect temperature. It was a combo of bison, pork, and beef. The red onion marmalade on top was awesome. It added a sweetness and a lot of great flavor. A couple other people had the fried egg on top and they enjoyed it. The bun wasn't store bought and tasted homemade, very similar to what my husband bakes. It was nice to have a bun that doesn't disintegrate. The hand cut fries that came with the burger were the best fries I have had in years. Another friend INHALED the white fish. I didn't taste it but he said it was great. Someone else got the pork belly and kohlrabi gratin. She said it was great and was really happy with her choice. I wish I hadn't been at the opposite end of the table so I could have stolen a bite. It looked good. For a cocktail I had the Tavern Infusion. It was great and refreshing. There was a good selection of beer and wine, too. I stuck with one cocktail and water though. It was a nice touch when the owner came around to the tables and said hi and checked on us and other tables. She seemed really nice. Everyone at our table enjoyed the meal. We will definitely be back again, hopefully sooner than later.", 
      "Warm popcorn in galvanized micro-buckets greeted us with a wonderful crunch and delightful nibble while our beers arrived, the deviled eggs were a true highlight. \u00a0Service was wonderful, and there was an understated elegance and relaxation in the staff and the atmosphere.Tiny smelt breaded and fried with lemon mayo were a hit; the wonderfully seasoned pork-belly with grits melted like chocolate as it entered my mouth. \u00a0However, the special pork shank and beans seemed a bit of a miss, and the mac and cheese, although quite tasty, was so large and rich and hot that it was difficult to enjoy-maybe it could be a small appetizer, side? \u00a0The chef at Big Grove definitely puts out quality, tasty food that re-imagines the standard Midwestern menu. \u00a0I applaud that. However, some of the details were slightly troubling: out of draw item (burger) at 7:00 PM; slight gaffe on menu 'These beers?'; one dish that didn't quite work.3.5", 
      "Great new option in downtown Champaign. \u00a0Everything about this place has a light touch--both casual and selective. \u00a0The welcome snack is a daily-fresh made popcorn with a rotating seasoning. \u00a0Ours was crazy good, but we had to ask the server to place the flavor: \u00a0cumin & orange zest! \u00a0Apparently the chef regularly changes it.The tap and bottle list is craft beer lover's friend. Not trying to outdo a number-of-taps contest, but all the right choices were there. Especially loved the slightly sarcastic \"These Beers?\" bottom of section of the menu for those who want a Bud Light instead.Tater tots are like nothing you've seen: homemade and tasty with an apple sauce. The smoked bacon practically jumped off the deviled eggs.The menu feels relatively small when you're used to the pages and pages on your typical chain. \u00a0And I wouldn't mind if they expanded it a bit, but there were so many good looking items, I think it will take several visits without any boredom. That most of the ingredients are locally bought makes it worth it.Service was exactly what you expect from a place like this: a whole step above any chain restaurant. Constant attention, knowledgeable about the food, funny and warm, but never over-intrusive. Perfect!Nice job, Big Grove Tavern. \u00a0We'll be back.", 
      "Amazing entrees. Appetizers are very different and delicious. Apple and pear crisp for dessert. Best meal I've had in downtown champaign. Great ambience and music. Will be coming here more often.", 
      "We decided to give this a try on Valentine's Day...and overall I would say it was very enjoyable. \u00a0This is the third time I've eaten here, so I feel qualified at this point to pass judgement. My impressions so far:The food is great...although the dinner portions tend to weigh in on the \"smaller\" side. \u00a0I had the filet, and what it lacked in size it made up for in taste. It was well cooked and tasted excellent. However, the side that came with it (a mixture of small carrots and potatoes) left something to be desired. This isn't a place you'll go for dinner and take home any leftovers. \u00a0The Risotto also tasted great, and while it also wasn't a huge portion, it seemed to be enough to suffice. \u00a0The prices were also fairly reasonable for a medium-to-upper scale restaurant, except for the $8 cocktail which seemed on the skimpy side, size-wise.Two other standouts at this place for me are the deviled eggs appetizers ($1 a piece, and delicious!) and the Tavern Burger, which is a mixture of beef, pork, and bison and is the reason I will keep going back. \u00a0For my money, it's one of the best burgers in town.", 
      "I came back to visit my hometown and was told Jim Gould's closed and was replaced by this place, and my friends said they really like the beer and food here. I am so happy that Champaign downtown has Big Grove Tavern! We sat at the bar for drinks and dinner. They had an excellent beer selection, with several Midwest and even some local brews and seasonal ones. The bartender was very helpful and attentive. The night we went, they had recently roasted an entire pig, so their specials were these amazing pork dishes. I enjoy pork quite a bit - beer and pork - since I've lived in Berlin and love German cuisine, so this place made me really happy. Based on my one visit, I'd recommend this place to all my friends and family, and anyone visiting from out of town.", 
      "Solid. For sure.First of all, the decor is great. The place is open, airy, and has this beautiful ceiling with old branches. It's very modern but still cozy. I loved it. It totally went with their idea that food should be natural and local, it fit.Our drinks were pretty great. I had the Frasca and my boyfriend had a bourbon drink and both were great. The wine list is kind of sweet too.Then of course, the food! I had the steak which was really really great, especially rare, yum! The potatoes were creamy and everything was just super tasty. My boyfriend absolutely loved his pork tenderloin. The friends we were with had the steak and chicken and loved it too. The portions were also great, I was stuffed when I was done! Next time though, I definitely want to try the appetizers and small plates. Let me also just say that \u00a0our server was awesome. Everyone there is super nice and I have a friend that works there. It's just a great crew!After dinner, we had a couple of coffee drinks (with some special stuff in it) and it was a perfect end to a really nice meal. Basically, I'm giving this place four stars because I finally don't have to keep going to Bacaro or Radio Maria for a really nice meal in this town. After being a townie and moving to Chicago, I've come to realize that it's about time that \u00a0we get more places like this in Champaign!", 
      "Great food, great people, great atmosphere! Love Big Grove", 
      "We went for an early Saturday night dinner, drawn in by new fine dining in the area (which is limited) and the promise of local farm to table style. We are huge fans of many local farm efforts, which can be sampled at the Common Ground Co-op and the Market at the Square on Saturdays at Lincoln Square Mall -- and now, Big Grove Tavern.First, the food, from a foodie perspective: Fresh product, well selected and well cared for. The flavors of the natural food are highlighted. The preparation is often minimally invasive. The technique is classic French. The flavor profile is quiet. My partner and I both wished for something a touch bolder. For example, the deviled eggs, a pre-starter, have yolks mixed with peas. We would suggest adding an acid note, perhaps a pickle. It was nice that they brought out flavored popcorn as a freebie with our drinks -- a feature at BGT. The flavor of the night was white truffle oil -- and you could taste the oil. That was a real win.For starters, my partner had the chili and cornbread, and I had the chicken liver pate with pickled onions and stewed rhubarb. I think mine was better -- really delicious, with rich, deeply flavorful pate contrasted against the rhubarb, which gave the bite the sweet and sour it needed to cut through. The farmstyle, whole grain bread had a wonderful crunch. The cornbread was a bit too refined -- it needed \u00a0more crust and less cake, more corn flavor and less cafe baked-good sweetness. The chili was savory, but mild--no real taste of chilis.The entree and dessert courses were both very good, especially dessert. My partner had the short ribs, which were beautifully medium rare -- not a hint over or under. I had the roast chicken with dumplings, which was amazingly good. Crisp skin, moist and flavorful meat, with a delicious herb broth under. Three dumplings that tasted like a delicate stuffing and had a satisfying bite. Slices of asparagus that also had a nice bite and a lovely green flavor still -- not at all cooked out. The portions seemed just right -- not too much and not too little.For dessert, my partner had the rhubarb crisp and i had the chocolate pot de creme. Both were really superb: refined, flavorful, rich, balanced. Nothing fussy -- just satisfaction in every bite, with very good coffee on the side (they use a medium blend from the Columbia Street Roastery -- a fine choice).The food is not bold. Or experimental. Or imaginative. But it is good, very good -- much better, I thought, in terms of technique than Carmon's Bistro.It's clear from the limited but well selected menu that the chef behind it is attempting to appeal to middlebrow Midwestern tastes, but doing it in such a quality way that I found it kind rather than condescending. People who don't necessarily like a chi-chi dining experience will enjoy the food, and those who do like fine dining will think it is predictable in its selections but well done nonetheless.Second, the decor and atmosphere: I generally like the blend of industrial and contemporary tavern that the interior designer seems to have been going for, although the dark colors dominate a little too much, despite the effort to add bits of fun in the lighting options. BGT has a chic, young vibe -- somewhere between casual and serious. Dark gray walls with a black drop tile ceiling, black wire-cage pendant lamps with industrial bulbs of different shapes (reminds me of the recent Restoration Hardware line), bleached branch chandeliers over the bar area, outdoor party-lights with clear exposed globe bulbs interlaced with raw blond planks (one off note: the planks have lumber-yard stamps, which may be a bit too low-end for what they were going for), \u00a0fairly inexpensive light-wood grain tables and nicely selected dark chairs--if a bit flimsy--and booth upholstery. I hope that over time BGT will invest in some better art pieces, and ones that bring more interest and warmth to the interior. There's seating outside too, if you're a smoker or don't mind getting it second hand.Third, cost: Yes, yes, it's on the expensive side. BGT is fine dining, not family dining. I won't be eating here every night either. Of course, any diner can make the meal more affordable by just sticking with an entree, rather than getting the whole shebang -- I'd guess for dinner that this would run you $20-25 tops. But if you have a deeper pocket that night, the whole shebang here could run you $100 with tip for two -- and you still won't feel cheated. The value is here, given the quality of experience.Fourth, service: BGT has a young, eager service staff. They took good care of us, and every other table I could see. From beginning to end, we enjoyed our time here.", 
      "Solidly good food, but overpriced based solely on the quality & quantity of it. \u00a0Very cool ambiance too.My friend made the point that considering ALL of the food is local the price is a steal. \u00a0He's right. \u00a0If that's your thing, then the price is pretty great.", 
      "Upscale Tavern with amazing food! All the food is locally sourced. They have great bar snacks. My favorite is the gourmet popcorn. They change the flavor daily. We had lemon zest and cumin flavored popcorn. They have a bison, pork and beef burger that my husband loved. The butternut squash and pumpkin soup was delicious! Highly recommend this restaurant", 
      "What a great place for a nice dinner out. Four of us recently made an Open Table reservation on a Friday night before catching a movie at the Art. The staff were quite friendly and efficient, and the food was very good. Probably the highlight of the meal was the popcorn instead of bread or rolls; the night we went it was flavored with roasted fennel seed and lemon zest. I usually don't like the taste of anise, but this was really good, and we got free refills without asking.We ordered a vegetarian ragout (creamy with a hint of spiciness), the burger (it's big burger a unique taste from the mix of beef, pork, and bison), the pork shoulder (cooked perfectly), and the pork sausage (after the waitress checked on us, we discovered the root vegetables weren't cooked well enough; the dinner is on a low-carb diet and wasn't going to eat them anyway, but the waitress was very receptive when we mentioned it later). Also two beers--I can't remember which. We didn't have room for dessert, but if it's still on the menu, I want to try the spiced pumpkin bread pudding. Hello? Heaven is calling...Pros: good, local food; great staff; reasonable prices at the \"expensive for a college student\" level (c. $15 per entree)Cons: dim lighting + aging eyes + small print on the drink menu = squintingnoise level --All too often it seems that chic decor and sound-proofing are non-intersecting circles of restaurant interior design. Would it be possible to put some fabric or panels on the ceiling to absorb some of the sound?"

      "Ok, I had some low expectations coming in, considering Jim Gould's old restaurant was here, and that was a VERY big disappointment, i wasn't expecting a ton from Big Grove Tavern. \u00a0Tonight was my 3rd visit, but first for dinner and i was very pleased!I had the Tavern Burger which is a beef, bison & pork burger, red onion marmalade, cornichon aioli, house-cut fries and added the Fried Egg. \u00a0I did not get the Aioli on my burger. \u00a0It was DELICIOUS! \u00a0for me the fried egg made this burger one of, if not THE best in Champaign/Urbana. \u00a0And i've had what is considered to be in the top 5 in america at Kuma's Corner in Chicago, its not that good, or that big, but its plenty excellent. \u00a0the house cut fries were very good too, i loved the seasoning.my wife raved about the Beer Brined Pork Loin, saying it was \"delicious\". \u00a0The place is a little pricy, but they also have very close attention to detail and the food is all from local area suppliers, which is a nice touch and compliment to the local growers.I will be back again at this restaurant, i can't wait to try the BLT with the egg at lunch next!", 
      "This was our second visit to Big Grove. \u00a0We found it the first time traveling through Champaign via Yelp. \u00a0Tried it again while traveling at Thanksgiving. \u00a0A very nice find. \u00a0Interesting food, decent atmosphere and very good service. \u00a0And making the reservations via Yelp was very cool.", 
      "Good local source food and good menu. \u00a0We popped in on a Friday night and sat in the bar area. \u00a0Devil eggs and chicken liver pate was rich and delicious. \u00a0Burger and mushroom farro for entrees and then moved on to the apple crisp for dessert. \u00a0The food will not knock your socks off, but sometimes you just need a easy going chill place to eat some good food. \u00a0Nice spacious restaurant vibe with good service too!", 
      "Me and a group of friends went to this place last night. \u00a0We were all skeptical since we live in Chicago and never had a really good meal in Champaign - always average to below average. \u00a0This place surprised all 6 of us and we all ordered different things - the appetizers were great - deviled eggs and fried brussel sprouts - both great and I usually don't like deviled eggs. \u00a0I got the burger and it was real good - they forgot to put the egg on it like i ordered but brought me out an egg minutes later. \u00a0the drinks were really good too - had a bullet old fahioned. \u00a0All in all, definitely glad we went there and will definitely go back on the next visit.", 
      "I had the fish which was good., but the relish was strange. \u00a0It was different kinds of radishes . \u00a0Small portions. \u00a0The dessert \u00a0was great.", 
      "I felt like I was in Chicago - a huge compliment to this downtown Champaign spot with it's locally sourced food and beer list. \u00a0We started with a truffle popcorn amuse, both savory and sweet, served in adorable mini tin buckets. \u00a0Having a bite of each of my friend's dishes - from butternut squash/goat cheese sandwich, burger and my own pulled pork (a bit dry and lacking on the slaw, but still quite tasty), I left satiated and ready to come back. \u00a0The beers come in small 10 ounce juice glasses if you just want a few sips, or you can go with a tall boy if you've designated a driver for the evening. \u00a0The artwork is mostly local, minus the large birch sculpture hanging over the bar. \u00a0It was such a great statement piece, that I might have to borrow the design aesthetic once I get my dream house. \u00a0Well done, Big Grove, I'll see you again soon.", 
      "The food here is terrible; especially if you're looking at vegetarian options. The mushroom farro was tasteless. I realize that farros are supposed to be relatively healthy and not the most flavorful items; but the mushroom farro here can be described as bland at the very best. It was served half-cold and dry-ish like someone just heated by a frozen pack without caring to garnish it with even the slightest bit of flavor or hardwork. The fingerling potato salad came with a honey mustard dressing, which is okay. But who in the world would pair already bitter rhubarb with a mustard sauce to create one of the most horrible tastes one can experience. The chef at big grove, of course. This was a waste of time and money and I'm never going here again.", 
      "Great food. \u00a0The Spinach Salad with grapefruit and chicken is unreal. \u00a0I'm not even a huge salad fan generally and the chicken is ridiculously tender.", 
      "Wow. This place feels very hip ;) Compared to the conservative drab feeling of Jim Gould they did an INCREDIBLE job of the remodel. You HAVE to try every single appetizer, they're all winners. Me=impressed.", 
      "I want to like this place. \u00a0I really do! \u00a0The food can be quite good! \u00a0I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the service, which has been some of the worst I have received in Champaign-Urbana. \u00a0More on this shortly.I love select dishes on the menu, but I feel like you have to know what to order. \u00a0The burgers are INCREDIBLE. \u00a0I never want to eat another burger that is not a mix of beef, bison, and pork. \u00a0Awesome. \u00a0And the fries with it are great!As much as I enjoy the burgers, there are times that you want some variety. \u00a0I know that it is trendy to include deviled eggs on a menu, but this are nothing special. \u00a0However, I feel like the pretzel makes up for this. \u00a0The pretzel is great and if you like your mustard with a HEAVY amount of spicy horseradish, this is for you! \u00a0I also really enjoyed the pork belly, but wish it was larger than just a starter.All of that being said, all of my recent experiences there have been a service disaster! \u00a0We have enjoyed going for the Friday outdoor concert series because we can sit outside and enjoy dinner, a beer, and the music. \u00a0In fact, until the service problems began we would go every week religiously. \u00a0Earlier in the summer the service was not a problem. \u00a0However, the past several times we have gone, we have literally had to BEG to be waited upon. \u00a0Each of these times, we have arrived, been seated, and then waited for 20-30 minutes before any server came to our table to even take a drink order. \u00a0We have had to ask the hostess or manager, some times several times in the same meal, to have one of the wait staff come to our table just to take an order. \u00a0The last straw was when the same friend was there for TWO DIFFERENT MEALS IN A ROW (seated at an entirely different table) and she too was talking with the management to try and get someone to take our order.The paranoid person in me worries that this lack of service is because we came with a small child. \u00a0Our child is quite well-behaved in a restaurant, but we try to be courteous and go for very early dinners when we know she will not be a problem. \u00a0We always try to order the full meal (drinks, dinner, dessert) up front and ask that the bill be given to us when the drinks arrive so we can make a quick get-away if necessary. \u00a0My point is that this is the one time that we actually get to go out and enjoy an adult meal and activity and I don't want it regularly spoiled by bad (or nonexistent) service, regardless of whether or not it is because I have a child with me. \u00a0I have wasted this time for several weeks in a row at Big Grove and don't plan on doing so again for a long time. \u00a0There are plenty of other options in the area.", 
      "Big Grove Tavern is a SUPER addition to the Champaign food landscape. From the first step inside the door, I love the atmosphere that is set by the hanging string lights, twisted wood light fixtures, and basic (but neat) hanging 2x4's. The food is fantastic, and as much as possible locally sourced. I love the Big Grove burger with fried egg on top, as well as the mac and cheese and tater tots appetizer. Because of the local aspect of the ingredients, expect to pay $2-3 more than you would at a local chain, but the improved atmosphere and deliciousness definitely make it worth it!", 
      "Yesterday my girlfriend and I had dinner at Big Grove. First, we had the french fries. They were incredible. We really loved the malt vinegar aioli. Second, she had the short rib and I had the mac and cheese. Everything about the short rib dish was perfect. I mean, really everything tasted amazing. The mac and cheese was just not as cheesy as I want out of my mac and cheese. The bacon tasted good in the dish but I probably wouldn't get it again. (5 stars for everything besides the mac and cheese. 3 stars for the mac and cheese).", 
      "A solid two stars, yes!First of all, I'll say the taste of the food is pretty good. \u00a0The quality of the food and drink was above average. \u00a0The popcorn presented when we arrived was nicely flavored with spices, but came in a rather small tin. \u00a0We began with two cocktails which were delicious, but for the area, were either too small, or overpriced. \u00a0Thus began the battle of the perceptions in regards to overpriced versus tiny portions.We did not have appetizers because in my mind, they were a little pricey. \u00a0Deviled eggs for $1.00 each? \u00a0Ok, I get it, these are local eggs. \u00a0But half of an egg with a little mayo and some flavoring mixed into the yolk for $1.00? \u00a0Nope, still expensive. \u00a0Fries for $4.00? \u00a0Nope, not for this guy. \u00a0Besides, Illinois isn't know for their potato harvests. \u00a0$9.00 for a mixed greens salad? \u00a0How about make that salad plural and give us a couple of them for that price?Moving on, I wanted to try the famous \"Tavern Burger.\" \u00a0However, at 7:45 p.m., in a restaurant which wasn't packed out, they were out for the evening. \u00a0Really? \u00a0Hmmm, how strange. \u00a0You mean the cheapest choice for dinner, the one item which was mentioned in the newspaper and was considered your house specialty, and, worth mentioning again, your CHEAPEST dinner choice, was out so early? \u00a0How very strange... \u00a0I guess that meant I would have to choose a more expensive option. (And, incidentally, our server told us you made it fresh every day. \u00a0So, why didn't you just whip up a little more of the mix? \u00a0Or, does the bison truck come very morning?)We chose the Trout and the Pork Loin. \u00a0First, the portion sizes were tiny. \u00a0For the price of the trout, we expected at least half of a small trout for $18.00. \u00a0What we got was about 1/3 to \u00a01/2 of a side of a small trout. \u00a0 As for the pork, we received what amounted to about a 3 oz. portion. \u00a0Now, I understand it's local. \u00a0But, and I'm saying this as a consumer and a cook, pork is not expensive. \u00a0There is no grocery store in Champaign where you can go and find any cut of pork out pricing Beef. \u00a0 And, the accompaniments, the turnips, chicory and cornbread were nice, tasty and well presented, were cool and not substantial. \u00a0The pork, for the price, should have been at least twice the size, and even this would have made the price extravagant.We shared a bottle of white wine from the menu, the wine selection being very good by the way, and also had dessert. \u00a0I had the Ice Cream Sandwich (which should have been slightly warmed so as to not have been served rock hard), and my guest had the Pot de Cr\u00e8me. \u00a0Both were delicious!Overall, I believe our bill totaled more than $140.00. \u00a0Can you believe it? \u00a0$140.00 for two cocktails, one bottle of white wine which retailed for about $13.00, two main dishes and two desserts. \u00a0 Fine for Haute Cuisine, not fine for a tavern.We found the service to be just about perfect, as our server was attentive and respectful of both our needs and our privacy.The atmosphere is great in this place. \u00a0The food is good, but not great. \u00a0With the expanding options in the area, especially the great options across the street, there is little to nothing to draw me back to this establishment.", 
      "I have a generally favorable view of this place. Like others before me have said, I definitely appreciate their fresh, simple approach that values quality ingredients and careful preparation.Several things hold me back from a full-throated endorsement, however. \u00a0First, the prices are steep. \u00a0The one reasonably priced entree item- the burger- frequently runs out. \u00a0I'm not sure if I just hit this place at the wrong time over and over, but I've only ordered it successfully once. \u00a0They know the demand is there, so why not have more? I understand that they don't want to freeze it, or whatever, but I've hit that place at 7 o'clock, and they're out of hamburgers. \u00a0It becomes apparent pretty quickly why there's no rush to increase their supply- because every other entree costs 5 dollars more. Secondly, the other (non-burger) entrees are small. \u00a0I rarely finish my plate at ANY restaurant, but here, it's no contest; I finish it all. \u00a0Last time, I ordered the mushroom risotto. \u00a0It was AMAZING. \u00a0I loved it! \u00a0But the size of it seemed like little more than a side dish. \u00a0My S.O. and I looked at each other at the end of the meal with our empty plates between us and I could tell we were thinking the same thing - I'm still so hungry! \u00a0Afterwards, we ended up going to Merry-Ann's around the corner for chili cheese fries (our adventure at that establishment is detailed in another review).Finally, service is hit or miss. \u00a0Last time, my S.O. ordered the special. \u00a0The server said that she wasn't sure they still had the special, so he went ahead and ordered a back-up entree in case (this was his idea, not hers). \u00a0She never came back to tell us what result. \u00a0The runner came out with our food, and of course, it was not the special, but the backup. \u00a0She was busy, but it would have been nice if she had just swung by and told us that they were indeed out of the special. \u00a0I think she might have been new, because her server-patter was also wanting. (She really didn't know what to say to us when she first approached the table.) \u00a0She also forgot my Patio Pounder (a great cocktail, BTW) until I reminded her, and I only got it once I was almost done with my entree. \u00a0I had water, so it was no big deal, but the overall experience (coupled with the bill at the end) quashed the overall good vibe of the place.Before I move, I do think I will go back and give it another shot. \u00a0Their date night menu looks like a good deal, and I'm really rooting for this place to be all it can be.", 
      "Nice beer selection. \u00a0Split roasted chicken with herb dumplings was exceptional. Nice atmosphere for a college town restaurant. Quality service, ambiance and ingredients. \u00a0Definitely will revisit when I'm in the area.", 
      "Went for lunch last week...maybe the chef has changed since the soft opening as I found nothing overwhelming about the menu and would agree with one reviewer who described it as expensive and limited. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it was described as coming with mixed greens since I'd rather have that than sweet potato chips and there was no salad when I got my sandwich. When I asked the waitress she said my salad was on my sandwich...which did have a piece of lettuce on the bottom. Besides that my sandwich was very dry and tasteless. My lunch mate wanted a cup of chili and was told emphatically they only had bowls but when it arrived it was the smallest cup of chili I have seen and for 7$? \u00a0The cornbread was bigger than the cupAnother person in the party had the burger. \u00a0The 12$ burger. When it arrived it looked like a slider. \u00a0I do think he said it was good, but there are far better burger for a better price than 12$.Our bill for lunch for 4 was 70$. Way too expensive for lunch. Even a NYC lunch but the food was not worth it at all. \u00a0On the way out a couple diners seated next to us said they couldn't wait to get on their Facebook accounts to let people know how bad this place is. And we agree. I give this place 6 months. Save your money and go to destihl or any other burger joint for better food", 
      "Great service and the food was done to perfection. The wait staff was very attentive and prompt. I would recommend Big Grove for a casual evening or a formal night out.", 
      "I have been here for a Soft Opening dinner and their first official lunch. I was not disappointed by either. For dinner we tried 4 of the 6 starters and all I have to say is that the hash browns were excellent and I could probably eat the pickled veggies every day and never tire of them. The Pate is a must try and the deviled eggs are just perfect. We tried 4 of the soups/salads and while I was not a fan of the seared pork belly, others at the table thought it was very good but the cheesy grits on the bottom were amazing. The cornbread was delightful (almost as good as Black Dog) and the chili just right. I look forward to trying the other items. The entrees were a great size and very well done. I had the pan seared fish which was perfectly cooked and had a side of pickled veggies. The cornbread stuffing on another plate was so good. The chicken was very tasty. The steak was cooked to a great temp. We also had the mac and cheese, they seem to understand that people like cheese and bacon because this dish did not disappoint. I plan on going for dinner many times. For lunch we were disappointed that the burger had already run out but we will have to go back earlier to try it. The steak sandwich was very good but the star on that plate was the Sweet Potato Chips, they were absolutely delicious. The horseshoe was very good and I especially enjoyed the sauce. I will be heading over there again for lunch very soon.This place is a great addition to downtown Champaign and a great replacement to Jim Gould's. The decor is very well suited to the atmosphere the place is trying to convey. I love that they expanded the bar. The prices are a bit high compared to some of the other places downtown but the food is of such a great quality that it is well worth the price.My biggest disappointment is that I am always too full to try the desserts because they look very good.", 
      "Great cocktail list, an amazing burger, and a fantastic play on a wedge salad.Friendly and knowledgable staff and a comfortable space make it a must if in Champaign.", 
      "With an emphasis on locally sourced foods, and a chef from California, we were hoping the local food movement could come to Central Illinois as successfully as it has in Northern California: excellent, innovative, and well prepared food that supports local farmers and ranchers while often exceeding the expectations of diners. Alas, it is not to be.In spite of many available tables, we were seated in a dark and cavernous (all in black) alcove. \u00a0Although elsewhere it was the bright light of day, we were barely able to make out the menu in the darkness. \u00a0We ordered wine by the glass to start; they waved the bottle over the glass and delivered a very small quantity for a full price pour. \u00a0Actually, I like the option of small-glass, but only if they offer the option of paying accordingly...I've had larger pours at free wine tastings around town. \u00a0Illinois is beer country, and as they are going local perhaps we would have been better to order a local brew.We waited a long time for our food, allowing our meager splash of wine to warm in the glass so as to save the few swallows to have with our meal. \u00a0At long last when it arrived, the spouse's was pleasant enough but mine was not at all as described. \u00a0I had ordered the chicken salad on wheat bread with greens; one of the few sandwiches that did not say it was served with chips. All flavors were erased by a thick layer of Dijon mustard and it was served on very dried out toast with chips on the side. \u00a0The \"greens\" were a piece of lettuce inserted between the mass of mustard and the dried out bread. \u00a0The person at the next table ordered the same dish and had the same impression, asking the waitress where the greens were and commenting on the dried out toast. It was supposed to have tarragon and other interesting ingredients, but every flavor was eclipsed by the strong Dijon mustard.Don't know if it was the worst lunch I had since moving here last summer, but it was clearly the most expensive bad lunch I have had, approaching $50 for two sandwiches--one nearly inedible--and a smidgeon of wine. This was very expensive for mixed quality, not a good value.Pluses: I like that they are trying to source from local farms, although I missed having a fish or seafood option on the menu. \u00a0The staff was very friendly. Minuses: Expensive, very small portions, descriptions on menu not accurate, food quality uneven, some bad seating locations. \u00a0I gave it two stars for the effort to source locally and the friendliness of the staff. \u00a0I a willing to give them a try again in a couple of months to see if they iron out the kinks, but only if I am feeling extravagant.", 
      "I love this place! Ingredients organic and locally sourced as much as possible; food as good as I've ever had anywhere.Local sourcing and the chef's own creativity mean that the the menu changes seasonally, but they seem to be keeping some staples (such as the roast chicken with dumplings, the steak, the tavern burger, macaroni & cheese...). Lots of vegetarian options, but plenty of dishes for carnivores as well. Be sure to do yourself a favor and try the gourmet deviled eggs.With everything I've ordered so far, even if there are some ingredients I'm not sure about--maybe I've never even heard of them, let alone tried them, or maybe they're being used in a combination I wouldn't have expected--when I actually try them, especially together with the other ingredients in the dish, I find that they work perfectly. Trust. However, the staff are excellent about accommodating food sensitivities and allergies as well.You might get the impression, from this review and even from stepping into the restaurant, that it could be a really snobby place--\"foodie\" in the worst sense. This could not be further from the truth. The staff have always been friendly and welcoming, very willing to explain dishes, make candid recommendations, and share interesting info about where things came from--like the lovely homemade hibiscus syrup that my party's waiter once recommended for our lemonade, which it turned out he had made himself. Sometimes I've even seen the chef take the time to come out and speak with diners.One thing to keep in mind: although no individual item on the menu seems unreasonably expensive, they can add up pretty fast. Still, I'm willing to pay for such good food, even if, on a student's budget, I can only afford it on special occasions. Lunchtime might be a good option, to help keep the bill down.All the friends and family I've taken to Big Grove, or recommended it to, have been delighted. It is definitely among the best restaurants in C-U right now.", 
      "Pretty good meal - kids loved the burger with a fried egg. \u00a0Fries went well with the burger. \u00a0IMO, some local dishes leave me wanting a little more flavor. \u00a0I'll say three and a half - call it four.", 
      "Probably the best place to eat in town now. \u00a0A quasi-Portland style menu with some unexpected combinations. \u00a0Cocktail prices are the bomb. \u00a0Cocktails are not large but I'm not complaining. Very good deviled egg.", 
      "Love this place! Fresh and supporting the local business! The coffee rocks too!!", 
      "Updating to note that I have come to love the Big Grove even more over the past bunch of months. It's become one of our date-night regulars as their menus have started to incorporate many more veggie and fish options. I would recommend going at a less-busy time since they have been known to run out of things on, say, Saturday nights at 7.30, but it's all delicious. Totally enamored of their new brunch selection, too! Go. Here. Now.", 
      "My husband and I find ourselves in Champaign once a year and we always go to Big Grove. \u00a0The food is spot on in terms of flavors, creativity and menu selection. \u00a0My only complaint would be the pacing. \u00a0We chose 3 apps to share and they came out all at once followed by our entrees 30 minutes later. It wasn't packed and we felt rushed and full. \u00a0The service is average. our waitress was very slow on drinks and refills (her loss on tips and total bill!). \u00a0The food is what we come back for!", 
      "Everything is covered in bacon. The pickled vegetables and spinach salad were the only good things. they should change their name to bacon grove tavern.", 
      "The inner design of this restaurant is really spacial, comfy and fresh. Good service and the food I ordered was pretty innovative and tasty. It is a nice place to chill with your friends and family.", 
      "We eat at Big Grove about once a week and definitely consider it our favorite restaurant in all of Champaign-Urbana! The food is excellent and everything about this place is getting better all the time. Tell everyone you know about CU's newest and most thought out restaurants is right in the middle of our growing downtown. Local, well made, and comfortable. Thank you, Big Grove!", 
      "I love this place. \u00a0I now visit at least, once a week. \u00a0The dishes are excellently prepared, plated and served. \u00a0The flavours to everything from the Appetizers to the Main Courses to the Dessert continue to impress. \u00a0I have too many favorites to enumerate, but I'd recommend Big Grove Tavern to anyone who loves food. \u00a0All local, always fresh. \u00a0The Tuesday fried chicken & waffles are amazing. \u00a0I have only tried the brunch once, but it was delicious and my whole family had a great time. \u00a0Loved the bloody mary's too. \u00a0The staff are incredible, possibly the best in town. \u00a0The servers know what they are doing and they do with elan, charm and a ready smile. \u00a0And everyone cares so deeply that the guests are having a great time.Lastly, I have been hanging out at Big Grove's beautiful bar (and I have learned that even the bar is \"local\" made by a local artisan) and it is becoming a truly cool after work watering hole.One word of advice, if you are planning on a Friday or Saturday dinner visit, you probably would be wise to make a reservation(which I did from their website via Opentable.com). \u00a0Easy to do. Try it. \u00a0You'll love it too.", 
      "Great soft opening meal. The tatter tots, beets and Amish chicken were particular stars. \u00a0Can't wait until the full open.", 
      "Living in Cincinnati, Ohio, it is all the rage to be a farm-to-table, in-season menu, locally-sourced restaurant. I love that scene so I was excited to try Big Grove Tavern for a nice dinner. I love that we could get a reservation at 8 p.m. and the service was wonderful. The menu looked very unique, flavorful and fun. However, none of the dishes blew me or my friends away. Everything was good and I appreciate how fresh the food was, but it all needed a little something more. The deviled eggs were awesome and so fun to order one at a time. Our wine was delicious and I appreciated their drink menu. The ambiance was cool as well. If I lived in Champaign I would go back, I just have a feeling that their meals are hit or miss.", 
      "I had the roasted turkey sandwich and my husband had the burger. They were both delicious and not too expensive. Also had the Busey Bramble cocktail and it was amazing! I will definitely be going back soon.", 
      "My husband and I went here for lunch on a Saturday, and at first I was completely stunned at the tiny menu. \u00a0There were 5 entrees, and I didn't think any of them stood out. \u00a0My husband ordered the Tavern burger (beef, Bison, and pork) and I ordered the Grilled Cheese because it was the only thing besides the burger that I thought I might like and it was only $8. \u00a0We each got a deviled egg ($1 each) and they were good, a little on the salty side though. \u00a0We also enjoyed the small bucket of popcorn you get for free. \u00a0Hubby's burger came with a huge pile of fries (good because the burger is $12, cheese is $1.50 extra) and I got a mixed green salad with my grilled cheese. \u00a0The vinaigrette on the salad was a bit salty as well. \u00a0The food was okay, the service was great, I like the fact that everything is locally sourced. \u00a0We might be back for dinner sometime, but we'll see...it's very expensive.", 
      "My wife and 2 co-workers had an excellent meal, after being referred here by hotel staff. She had a great filet, while other two had fish and pork chops. No one had dessert but I am told there are some interesting ice creams.", 
      "16 bucks for a BLT sandwich? 2.50 cents extra for some fries instead of chips? this place wasn't even good and a rip off. \u00a0And those little popcorn things are stupid. PUKE", 
      "We went with our kids, which may not have been the best idea, since they are young. However, the waitstaff and food were phenomeal, so we were able to enjoy a great meal as a family.", 
      "I want to give them 4 stars but their menu needs some work. \u00a0They have put a great deal of thought into the atmosphere and aesthetic of the restaurant but not enough into what the customer wants to eat. \u00a0I have visited three times and each time I go I come away a little more disappointed. \u00a0The unique menu loses its appeal when the food is more satisfying to look at on the plate than it is to taste. \u00a0The ice cream sandwich dessert was perhaps the toughest dessert I have ever ordered at any restaurant. \u00a0Their one vegetarian friendly option was mac and cheese which gets tiresome to vegetarians. \u00a0With the volume of alternative diets being practiced, especially in a college town, I assumed a trendy place like this one would cater more to the non-traditional eater. \u00a0Their new twists on traditional food abandons the American-fare loving customer, as well as the non-traditionalists.", 
      "WOW. \u00a0What a great restaurant. \u00a0It is certainly on the pricier side, especially if you're a student. \u00a0 However, I took my spouse on a date here, and we had a great time. \u00a0The entrees were great, the appetizer was really nice, and they even had classy, tasty flavored popcorn ( I believe it was fried rosemary? \u00a0Delicious!) for free at the tables. \u00a0They have a great beer menu, too.", 
      "Have eaten at Big Grove Tavern several times now and have never had a bad meal. Each time our expectations were met or superseded. We ate there last on New Years Eve and had awesome service as well as a fantastic meal. The roasted beet appetizer was incredible. Their menu is not extensive, but that tells me that what they do choose \u00a0to prepare will be done right. I would recommend BGT whole heartedly!!"

      "Kofusion gets a massive amount of hype around Champaign. Probably because it's the only nice / higher-end sushi place. Kofusion does have other entree dishes besides sushi as well, but you're really going for the sushi.Which, I have to say, very good. The rolls are definitely ample. 2 Rolls was sufficient for 2 people for dinner. We had the red dragon roll and the dragon roll. Both had good amounts of fish and eel. The red dragon was especially great with the sriracha on top and the additional fish in the roll. Loved the flavor, didn't even use wasabi/soy for the red dragon half the time.Also, both rolls came on plates with a fair amount of extra eel sauce. So many places cut back on the eel sauce for no real reason, but it's fantastic and I loved wiping up the extra sauce.Overall, I'd be willing to go back.", 
      "Classy. Sushi. Need more be written? Sundays and Mondays are the days to be here for $1 sushi night! Beautiful ambience and food is fresh and well platted. They have lovely outdoor seating and can accommodate large parties.**host stand is not the most attentive and watch out for the heavy beads on the way to the loo**", 
      "When to dinner with a friend. Food was OK. The atmosphere: earnest trendiness. Learned afterwards that the waiter had charged my credit card twice for the meal. Not ideal. So, I called and called... and called. Over the course of three days, the manager was either not in or not able to help. So, if you go, make sure you're correctly charged. Don't expect the restaurant to be concerned otherwise.", 
      "This place was across the street from where I was staying when in town for a wedding. \u00a0A group of us came to dinner before going bowling and the guy who helped us was incredibly friendly and welcoming. \u00a0The ambiance in this place is really nice and I loved the fish tanks. \u00a0The tea we ordered was delicious. \u00a0I believe it was jasmine. \u00a0The sushi was good and many at our table got the flaming phoenix and that was very cool to see brought to the table. \u00a0Everyone really enjoyed their meal and our service was outstanding.", 
      "I've lived in Champaign my whole life, and I'd never eaten at K.O. Fusion before today. I'd heard a few people rave about the dollar sushi but most people say it's \"meh\". My friend invited me today to meet her for sushi at K.O. and I was looking forward to it. We got there at 11:15, and the server was really nice and very attentive. That's about all I can give this place. I ordered a chicken Bento box that was $15 - I cringed when I saw the price, but the server reassured me that it was \"a LOT\" of food. The box came, and it had chicken stir fry that was pretty plain. Then it had 4 little pieces of California roll that were OK. There was a lump of rice that was undercooked. There were a few pieces of lettuce with an overpowering ginger sauce on it. I'm a very hungry person and I'm the least picky eater I know, and I didn't finish the Bento box. It's not because I wasn't hungry - it's because I couldn't. But what's more, there was certainly NOT $15 worth of food on that plate -- it wasn't \"a LOT\" of food. I ordered veggie dumplings for my daughter, who seemed to liked them. I thought they were pretty good, but they were lukewarm (the server made a big deal about how hot they were - and they were definitely not). The bill came and it was almost $25. For $25, I better have eaten the very best lunch of my life!! And I would've been more satisfied with a $5 footlong, sadly. This place is ridiculous. They have some nerve to charge so much money for food that's not even up to par with cheap fast food. The other restaurants downtown, for the most part, are pretty good. They're still overrated, but better than K.O.! I won't be back.", 
      "What a trendy little spot this place is! I am a huge fan of fusion restaurants, so that alone made me excited about this place. However, I think after seeing some of the dishes our table got, I should have gone the japanese route and gotten some sushi or sashimi!I did get their scallops in a panany curry sauce that was pretty good. And it had avocado in it as well which I always appreciate. Not quite enough vegetables though for my liking, but the flavor overall was good and it taught me that I need to work on my chopstick skills a little more too! Speaking of chopsticks, our dinner group was all White and then one biracial Asian/White man and he was the only one to automatically be given chopsticks and the rest of us got asked about whether we wanted a western or eastern eating utensil! I could believe it, especially as a race researcher myself. Pretty funny stuff. What if that one biracial Asian guy didn't know how to use chopsticks?? That would have been all kinds of awkward. But the drinks were made strong here, the service was good, and the ambiance is pretty fun too. You definitely feel like you went out to dinner here!", 
      "Let me start by saying it was $1 sushi day. And let me also say that the sushi was good. Very good even. The nigiri we ordered was great as well. But the service? The service was horrible. 20 min wait for water, 40 min wait for meal, 30 min more for the second round of sushi, and a whopping 90 min waiting for them to sort out our checks. I talked to the manager. \"10 more min and you'll be out of here, I promise.\" They still had our checks missed up. A 20% discount and free desserts later, I still don't know if I'm going to be back. Too bad. I really liked the meal.", 
      "Living in the midwest, you have to understand that sushi options are limited. Kofusion more than satisfies this. They have an expansive sushi menu that caters to every sushi lover, as well as a lunch/dinner menu with some tasty meat and vegetarian options.The food is always fresh - the coconut shrimp with mango is out of this world, as is the volcano roll. \u00a0 I've had the shiro and maguro nigiri numerous times - it's always consistently good.The dining area is nice - trendy, semi-upscale with private rooms for larger parties.", 
      "It's pretty good sushi done with a Midwest emphasis, served by mostly nice folks, under some weird mood lighting that thinks it might be hip but mostly makes me think about hitting some acid.I'm surprised people gripe about the price, since it costs more to eat at several of the burger joints close by. Seafood in the Midwest is absurd to purchase, so I expect it to be a little pricier, but it's fairly comparable. Today, we ordered an app, two bar drinks, three rolls and two desserts and it was $63. Not bad, IMO. I always wish the menu was more descriptive, especially about what sauces come on which rolls. I about burnt my lip off today. The service is hit or miss. Some of the staff behaves a little lofty, but maybe that's what they think people expect. Or maybe some people are just assholes. Anyway...if you're on the fence, go for dollar sushi and give it a try. You can order online, which is sweet. If you call it in, make sure they read it back. So...four stars for a lack of consistency.", 
      "One if the best sushi places in champaign. We usually go there every 2 week and it is amazing. They have outside dinning over the summer and the inside ambiance is also perfect.", 
      "Service terrible. Asked for a water 3 times, they brought one meal 10 mins before the others, and the others took a long time. Sushi was decent and is only 1$ (select menu items) on Sundays and MAYBE Monday too.", 
      "We called in for appetizer trays of assorted sushi and rolls. \u00a0The fish was prepared perfect and was some of the freshest I've ever had. \u00a0No fish smell. The nice lady I worked with was very professional and accommodating even staying open 30 min later for us to take away our order on a Sunday.The price of sushi vary greatly in parts of the USA but I would say this was on the high side. \u00a0I would recommend this place to someone with out hesitation as long as they realize this is not a budget meal.", 
      "Hate to say it......this just wasn't a good sushi experience. I've had sushi in different places all over the US, and this was genuinely one of the most unduly pricey yet unremarkable meals. Kofusion is mostly about being downtown and seeing/being seen-- it's the only \"little bit of LA\" that we have, and is a good place to go for sushi & drinks before clubbing. Then the problem presents its self- where to go clubbing? lOlI visited Kofusion with two guests, with the intention of \"introducing them to sushi\"- and was really disappointed, even a little embarrassed. I feel like there are chains on the west coast like Kabuki which offer far more exciting food, dramatically bigger portions, and with less contrived pretentiousness.", 
      "Have gotten takeout here many times previous, have finally made the dollar sushi night. Service was very attentive and nice. Like that we tried different maki rolls that normally we wouldn't order. Had the sake sangria cocktail which was delicious and refreshing in a hot summer night.", 
      "Kofusion is an interesting name for a restaurant, and they have, I was told, the best sushi in the Champaign/Urbana area.But when you've had sushi in diverse places, you really only know what's bad. \u00a0Thankfully, this wasn't. I had the Trio roll and it was very good. My date had the fried soft shell crab roll and the portion was huge. Typically I don't eat crab, but I helped her finish what was left and it wasn't too bad, and she said it was excellent.We shared Edamame too...I mean, who could mess up Edamame? \u00a0Good stuff.We topped it off with a nice Italian (I think) Pinot for her, and I had a Bartenura Moscato. Again, goodness!Kofusion is the best in the area they say. I can see why they say.", 
      "When friends ask me to describe this restaurant, I jokingly say, \"It's the kind of place where people eat their sushi with a fork and knife.\"To Kofusion's credit, it's the only venue in this rural Midwest town that attempts the urban dance-club sushi experience. Against that backdrop, it really is filling a unique niche. East Coast + West Coast elitist diners will likely be unimpressed (if you're ensnared here for years due to work or school, the nostalgia/desperation for big city experiences might change your mind).Arguably, if you're eating at an Asian fusion restaurant, you should have no expectations of \"authenticity\" in regards to the food. The drink selection features fruity cocktails with sexy, \"exotic\" names and $9+ price tags. Many items on the menu are outright American cuisine lacking even a hint of \"fusing\" with Asian elements. In that respect, this place is ideal for groups made up of both adventurous diners and those who fear \"fish breath.\"The biggest draw for Kofusion are the Sunday and Monday $1 sushi specials. Folks with raw food aversions need not worry. All of the $1 sushi options are variations of deep-fried meats, cream cheese filling, and mayonnaise/sugary sauces. There's such a demand on these nights that the preparation definitely cuts corners--but if you're filling up on these bite-sized heart-attacks, you're likely channeling your inner fat kid and won't mind the rushed presentation.For people who love Japanese cuisine for its delicate, clean flavors, the sushi bar also serves more \"traditional\" fare, though I've sometimes received pieces of sashimi sliced rather clumsily.My advice: the $1 price tag for the Sunday/Monday specials requires such little investment that it's worth a shot for new diners. It might even be the best opportunity for initiating people who are normally turned off by the idea of sushi.", 
      "I'm a SOCAL gal and therefore a bit of a sushi snob, but Kofusion was a nice surprise here in the land of flat.They certainly don't present their sushi in a way that I'm used to, nor are their offerings in any way comparable to a 'real' sushi restaurant, but that said - I like this place. The servers are great and the $1 sushi Sunday crowd was huge and happy. Happy? I'd say so! You just can't beat being well fed on fish and having an appetizer and a drink for $20.I looked at their regular sushi menu and was surprised: It is pricy in comparison to SOCAL sushi but I suppose location and limited competition have an impact, so I'll stick to Sundays. Their Big Roll was a nice surprise and there was enough spicy tuna to keep me happy. Next time I'll pass on their very average deserts and instead opt for MORE sushi!", 
      "I'm gonna be as simple as possible for the overall review: It's subpar restaurant at an above average price, unless you're having the dollar sushi. Then it's almost acceptable for the quality of the sushi you get.Everything else is pretty mediocre, yet they're charging for a higher end restaurant price. You're paying for atmosphere and that's about it. Yet, this is the best sushi place located in the CU area in terms of quality. So if you're desperate for sushi and have loads of money, give this place a try.", 
      "This place is cute, trendy in champaign, and always packed. \u00a0The staff here are very friendly, sushi is good (try the volcano, spicy tuna) and drinks are tasty. \u00a0I will definitely be coming back.", 
      "Kofusion is not authentic sushi, but it's still delicious. \u00a0Many of the rolls are deep fried or have cooked meat in them. \u00a0I recommend the Big Roll which is available at dollar sushi all day Sundays and Monday afternoons. \u00a0Sometimes the service is a little sketchy, one time I was served a drink in a dirty glass and the bartender didn't really seem that surprised or apologetic.", 
      "\"Good Area Sushi, Great Atmosphere, $1 Sushi Sunday\"Ko Fusion offers decent sushi for Champaign-Urbana area. Set conveniently downtown Champaign, the restaurant's atmosphere is very modern and chic - almost like a restaurant out of Chicago - and offers fusion entrees outside of their sushi menu. Ko Fusion offers a large bar area and outdoor seating.$1 Sushi Sunday is their best deal, which allows diners to sample $1 pieces of sushi from their menu.", 
      "We had my daughter's wedding reception dinner here. It was perfect! The chef, Nigel was very accomodating and the appetizers and meals brought raves from our guests.The staff was exteremely helpful with arranging the room to meet our needs. Great place for a special event. We have also enjoyed the buffet when my family stopped by for lunch.", 
      "Kofusion is definitely a good spot for a \"nicer\" dinner in Champaign. I'd been here a long time ago (like a year and a half ago) right after the place opened, and it was kind of dead and empty. But I went again a couple of nights ago, and the place was fairly crowded and happening. I was by myself so I sat at the bar, where the bartender took very good care of me.First a few words about the place: it's fairly large, with two different seating areas separated by the bar area, and they obviously spent the bucks on the decor. It's fairly modern, with a black and dark blue color scheme, a (fairly) beautiful bar, etc... You somehow can't help thinking that maybe they tried a little too hard to look sophisticated, but nonetheless it makes for a fairly good ambiance.The food is a mix of Asian (mostly Japanese) and new American. I'm usually weary of fusion... but it wasn't bad at all. The first time I was here, I ordered the chirashi, which wasn't the best I've had in my life but was surprisingly decent considering the location (as far from any ocean as you can be in the country...). This time, I started with a seaweed salad (tasty), followed by the whole trout, which came with sauteed mushrooms and spinach... The trout was pretty good, and the veggies delicious. I finished with the black sesame ice-cream: for $4, I expected a tiny little scoop, but I was served a heaping bowl of ice-cream with a strawberry and a wafer... just great.Not to forget their drinks: they have a pretty large selection of wine and sake, as well as a full bar. I had one of their specialty cocktails (the ko-tini: sake, absolut, and peach schnapps in a martini glass... pretty good), and another mixed drink. I was especially shocked to see how inexpensive they were, being used to NY prices.Based on the food only, I would have given this place 3-1/2 to 4 stars, but the service was top notch. The bartender was extremely friendly and efficient, and treated me very well... I'll probably be back.", 
      "Arrogant, unnattentive waiters, poor service, unfortunately the best sushi in town.Over the past month I've eaten $40+ meal THREE separate times during dollar sushi and received poor/horrible service. Each time, the waiter either forgot about us or didn't realize we were there, OR forgot to give us basic things like chopsticks, ginger, etc, and we waited another 5-10 minutes before my fiance went to the front to ask for some.After the third afternoon this happened, I brought it to the attention of a waiter who discussed it was dollar sushi so i can expect bad service.I then brought it up to the hostess when paying for my meal, telling him we come during the lunch hour to avoid poor service like what we experienced. He stated that I shouldn't come on dollar sushi night if I expect good service. Why would I come on another night to take a chance on poor service and PAY MORE?!?!", 
      "Came here on a Saturday night for my first ever non sushi meal here. Service was excellent, atmosphere was excellent, food was excellent. I originally ordered the salmon but they were out so I went with the duck. I'm not a foodie but it was a ten to me. Tender flavorful, not greasy. If you sit at 6pm on a Saturday night you won't need reservations but by 6:30 you will.", 
      "I go to used to go to Ko 2 to 3 times a month for the dollar sushi nights (Sunday AND Monday). \u00a0Dollar sushi nights used to feature around 10 rolls at discounted prices, each week a few of the rolls on the dollar menu would differ from the ones offered the week before. \u00a0The service was HORRIBLE, but the sushi made up for it and at $1 a piece you are paying around 70% of normal price (and since they are so overpriced at Ko to begin with this meant you were paying what you would pay anywhere else).Lately I've stopped going to Ko for several reasons. \u00a0The dollar sushi menu no longer changes. \u00a0It is nearly CONSTANT from week to week. \u00a0Sure it's a super discount so you can't complain too much. \u00a0However, sometimes some of the sushi you order comes to the table reeking of fish. \u00a0The pieces are $1 because clearly the fish is old. \u00a0And finally the service is utterly horrible on Sunday/Monday nights. \u00a0Sure they are busy, but the wait staff simply suck.To sum it up you can get sushi that is just as good and just as cheap at several other places in Champaign/Urbana. \u00a0Branch out a bit, trendy neon lights that change color don't mean the food is good.", 
      "Awesome food. Kinda pricy but worth every penny. Classy as shit. Try the crab cheese whatever. Itll make you change your orientation.", 
      "Well crap, I might be about to earn a bitch-badge. \u00a0The interior decor to me is not hip, trendy, or modern. \u00a0Unless you think that one friend with his blacklight room, lava lamps and Spencers Gifts-like light gadgets is awesome. \u00a0In which case, carry on my friend. \u00a0To each his own and all.Got take-out. \u00a0Called ahead for lunch sushi sampler and tempura. \u00a0Perhaps the first indication should've been my order takers complete stupification upon hearing they offered a sushi sampler. \u00a0They told me food would be ready in 20 min.Which was almost exactly how long I waited after arriving 20 min later. \u00a0Not cool on the service tip, Ko. \u00a0Sushi was fairly good, no complaint there. \u00a0The \"tempura\"? \u00a0So not. \u00a0Not tempura at all. \u00a0More like the deep fried veggies sold at a county fair.No win for you, Ko, and no second visit. \u00a0Ever.", 
      "I've been to Kofusion several times. The interior is very modern and sleek. The entrees are pricey and portions are on the smaller side. The servers are friendly and attentive. The $1 sushi deals on Sundays and Mondays are worth it. My favorite is definitely the big roll; I believe it has egg, crabmeat, avocado and some other stuff, then tempura fried with some sort of sauce on top. The best deal...and I'm kinda mad that I found out right before I graduated...is the lunch buffet! It's sucha great deal. Only weekdays though. The buffet is only around $10 and includes various entrees, such as curry chicken, fried fish croquettes, kimchi, soup, fried rice, noodles and three different types of sushi. The big roll is usually one of the three. Definitely keeps you full without breaking your wallet. :)", 
      "Went for dinner. Paid 60 dollars for some tea and \"mains\" that left two of us very hungry and considering a run for red lobster. Returned for dollar sushi upon all the good yelp reviews but found that it really wasn't worth it either. Lots of filler rice and sauces. Hardly any substance to any of the \"rolls\" by \"rolls\" they mean pieces, which really isn't a deal at all. Plus, really poorly done rice at that. Ick.Very nice service but considering the food, I say go to Sushi Kame down the road instead.", 
      "Well, where to start?The owner of this place is rude to guests and employees. She wanders around forever, blankly looking at the ceiling (or so it seems). I hate to be so harsh, but I applied for a job there. The woman asked me 2-4 questions and decided to hire me. Then, the owner came in the next morning and decided it wasn't going to work out. They wasted four hours of my time and showed me how not local and not fresh the food is. Really, they aren't unlike many other restaurants now a days. With so many people to feed and pressure to make money, there isn't much choice. I was excited to go to a \"hip\" place and work with sushi, something I'd never done before. But the other employees were hipster-ish and snobby. I go back there because the sushi is enjoyable and my boyfriend likes it. Last time we went (6-6-10) it took us almost 30 minutes just to get our check, because the owner didn't schedule enough people. I'm a waitress; I understand this issue. Naturally, we still tipped our waitress. However, when people come into town, there are many many restaurants I would recommend before KoFusion.", 
      "Kofusion tries a bit too hard to be hip and edgy. \u00a0As I am from Los Angeles, where pretentious restaurants are about as ubiquitous as corn is here, it takes more than mood lighting, pseudo-orientalist hipness, and cheap sushi specials to impress.That said, Kofusion's not *that* bad. \u00a0It's decent, for what you get. \u00a0The sushi is adequate, the drinks are on point, and the servers are friendly. \u00a0Not a bad way to spend a Friday night with friends. \u00a0Just don't think you're a) being \"authentic\" or (b) truly hip and classy.Just enjoy for what it is, a decent midrange sushi place in the midst of Chambana.", 
      "Monday rolls aroundI down two rounds of round rolls Drop twenty and leave(I have ONLY been here for one dolla' sushi night on Mondays. \u00a0For under $20, you can have a VERY filling sushi meal at Kofusion. \u00a0This isn't the best place in town for 'authentic' sushi, but they certainly do have some fun creations. \u00a0If you've never been here, Monday is an excellent time to try the place out without breaking the bank. \u00a0Just consider getting threre early... it tends to get busy as the night goes on! \u00a0It's a fun place with an interesting atmosphere and cheap sushi. \u00a0You can't go wrong. Recommended.)", 
      "I went to Kofusion on Monday, April 23rd, just before 6 and met my friend and her two sons for dollar sushi night. If my friend and her boys weren't already there, I would have turned around and left. I got a really bad first impression. It was busy (but nobody else was at the hostess station) and the hostess asked me if she could help me. I said that I was looking for my friend and her two young sons. She got really snotty, rolled her eyes and said, \"Well, you're just going to have to look for them yourself.\" Maybe she was just having a bad day. Who knows. I walked around and still didn't see them when another hostess came up and asked if SHE could help me. I told her who I was looking for and she goes, \"Oh! I know right where they are, come with me.\" She was cheerful and really helpful. It made up for the other super, rude hostess. We had the best waiter I have ever had in this town. No kidding. I saved my receipt so I could remember his name. It was Luke H. He was super attentive, extremely polite, friendly, and really sweet to my friend's kids. Our drinks never went empty and he checked in on us plenty without being annoying or hovering. Being dollar sushi night, I expected a longer wait for our food but our rolls were out quickly. They were all really good, too. The edamame and dumplings were great, also. Super big thanks to Luke H. and the NICE hostess. Hope the other one's attitude improves.", 
      "Sadly, I discovered Kofusion only a couple months before I graduated but once I discovered the place, I quickly became a regular! Firstly, people should recognize the restaurant for what it is: Korean fushion food. Thus, there's a wide variety of sushi, my personal favorite: hwe dup bap (like sashimi salad) and a smaller selection of hot (but still great--scallops anyone?) entrees that I usually have no interest in because I love sushi that much. If you need a quick sushi fix, dollar sushi Sundays (1 roll = $1) will definitely satisfy your cravings. There are 10 rolls that are offered at that price and they are definitely more of an American style sushi roll (read: little to no raw fish). At first I was really disappointed by this, but I honestly felt like the other rolls were good enough (Big Roll! Coconut Roll!) that I didn't mind at all and eat about $15-$20 worth of sushi anyway. Yes, I am a sushi whore. If you really want good sushi (with more raw fish or more interesting combinations), Kofusion is still the place to go. Their sushi menu is surprisingly extensive with your typical simple salmon rolls to rainbow-type rolls and more. It's about $1-$2 dollars more expensive than the other places in town but I've never felt like my rolls weren't worth the cost. Finally, Kristina is my favorite waitress. Maybe she remembered me for my order (hwe dup bap--seriously, try it if you love raw fish, it is divine) or maybe because I loved her so much I tipped well, but after just a few weeks of going weekly, a lot of the waiters remembered me and greeted me warmly. As a sushi lover, it doesn't really get any better than this. I'm not going to lie, Kofusion hits your wallet pretty hard but in the world of sushi, I don't find them especially more expensive than other sushi places that offer the same variety and quality of rolls. One recommendation I have is to try and get a roll (i.e. Big Roll--that's the one I had) wrapped in soy/rice paper. For those that don't like sushi because of the seaweed, this is a great alternative. For those that still love sushi, try it anyway--it's a great substitution that's worth it to get on its own once in awhile. I will forever miss Kofusion now that I'm not in the area so please, go get the hwe dup bap, Big Roll, Coconut Roll, or even the thai curry for me please!", 
      "Went here while visiting family in Central IL. I had been here years ago and loved it. While it was still awesome this time around, I feel like they have downsized their sushi menu and there weren't as many options. BUT, the two rolls I did order (and kim chi and the GF mousse cake) were all wonderfully delicious, came out quickly, and I will definitely return next time I'm in the area!", 
      "KoFusion is easily the best sushi in Champaign-Urbana. \u00a0They have a wide selection of Japanese food. \u00a0Also, on Sunday and Monday, they offer 10 different rolls for $1 each. \u00a0It's absolutely glorious.The atmosphere is also one of the best in Champaign-Urbana. \u00a0With sushi this good, I would be satisfied with a hole-in-the-wall location. \u00a0However, KoFusion is classy! \u00a0There are tanks of fish, complicated ambient lighting, waterfalls, and many other clever design elements. HIGHLY recommend.", 
      "It sort of pains me to not give Kofusion a higher rating because their sushi is really, really good. It's probably some of the best in town, though some of their true standouts also happen to be the most expensive. If I were grading it on it's sushi only I would give it four stars easily. The place has a nice atmosphere and is certainly more thought out than your typical CU restaurant. Is it trying too hard? Maybe, but let's be honest any attempt at trying could be perceived as \"trying to hard\" here because most places don't make any effort at all.So... shame about the food. I've only tried to eat from their non-sushi menu twice and have been disappointed each time. They're main dishes are over-priced and lack flavor. I will say their seafood had a nice, fresh taste but they don't really do anything with it. I'd recommend getting some friends, ordering a couple baskets of edamame, some drinks and many different kinds of sushi. My favorite is definitely the Lava Roll.", 
      "Duck was excellent! \u00a0Update: we returned more recently and tried the sushi, which was terrible -- it tasted like it had been frozen. \u00a0The menu is also completely random -- the restaurant doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: Korean, Japanese, American. \u00a0The food isn't *fusion*, its just three different types of cuisine on the same menu -- no one dish is a fusion of anything.", 
      "I often get dragged here every few weeks with coworkers since it is close to my work. \u00a0I have not been impressed one time. \u00a0I got to admit the inside is uniquely decorated, but I dislike almost everything else about this restaurant. \u00a0To start, the waiters are really rude and arrogant. \u00a0They all seem to have this pompous flair to them and I don't know why. \u00a0It most certainly does not make a good server. \u00a0They seem to act disgusted almost every time you ask them for something, and are neglectful of your table way more often that not. \u00a0It's not surprising for them to forget your table completely... The owner is also very arrogant, and acts sickeningly (and fake-ly) nice as she wanders aimlessly around the restaurant. \u00a0The food is alright, but most is very underwhelming to me. \u00a0The food is not very authentic, (aside from the sushi) and is more of an Americanized Asian restaurant (much like P.F. Changs), and I tend to hate those types of restaurants. \u00a0When I want Asian food, I want REAL Asian food. \u00a0Not crappy American creations labeled as Chinese food. \u00a0It's pretty expensive too. \u00a0Way overpriced in my opinion. \u00a0There is a $10 lunch buffet, but there are often only 4 entrees to choose from, and not much else in the ways of other food. \u00a0Fried and white rice? \u00a0Usually two plates of generic (and really cheap) sushi? \u00a0Totally not worth $10 at all. \u00a0Order from the menu for lunch and you are looking at paying over $10. \u00a0Dinner is even worse. \u00a0While I only went once for dinner, and usually end up here for the lunch buffet, the time I did go for dinner was terrible. \u00a0The menu is almost set up like a gourmet restaurant, as there's not a big selection at all, and most meals cost around $20. \u00a0O_O \u00a0The worst part is, the entrees come out on huge plates with the tiniest bit of food in the middle. \u00a0They call it New Age Dining but I call it \"I just got seriously ripped off\"I ordered the salmon dish. \u00a0It was $21 I think. \u00a0Ridiculous, I know. \u00a0Well, it came out raw in the middle. \u00a0I sent it back, 10 minutes later it comes back, and still raw. \u00a0I had to send it back twice and even after the third time it came back it did not taste right to me. \u00a0And like I said, it was the tiniest portion ever. \u00a0It was maybe a 6oz salmon filet on a plate garnished with sauce next to like a 1/4 cup of rice.... it really is pitiful. \u00a0My friend's entrees were similarly scarce looking. \u00a0I really don't know how this place gets so packed when it is so expensive and the food is not that good. \u00a0It's touted as a huge date spot as well, but I'm surprised most stomach up the huge entry cost. \u00a0I hear the sushi is great but I never had anything other than the stuff they put out on the lunch buffet and it was terrible. \u00a0It seems expensive too like everything else. \u00a0Some praise the $1 sushi night, but that's per piece and personally to me that seems like a high price as well.... \u00a0I would stay away if I were you, I often even find myself backing out of lunch with my coworkers simply because I can not stand this restaurant any more."

      "Update: \u00a0I finally returned after many years of being away from the university.Their specialty rolls are probably the way to go. \u00a0Not great.. but make an expensive experience less horrible.The rainbow roll was by far their worse. \u00a0Then tried the crunchy roll and the flaming phoenix. \u00a0Those were both decent rolls.Then it was better when we washed it down with a bunch of Manhattans and vodka martinis.**************************************************\u00ad*******************It's hip and chic decor (so it gets one star) is not enough to make for their HORRIBLE FOOD. \u00a0I can't even believe it's a sushi place... somebody that really likes raw fish would never eat here. \u00a0Their sushi has almost no fish. \u00a0Their $1 sushi Mondays suck because it's $1 per piece.. and the sushi doesn't taste good. \u00a0I have gone three times.. and I will never return. \u00a0I'd rather drive forty minutes to eat in Bloomington, IL. \u00a0There are better sushi restaurants there.", 
      "This place is incredibly overrated. \u00a0It's sooo overpriced and the food is only decent.The only reason to come here is for the decor I guess? \u00a0Also, to give it some credit, they're probably the only place around here with interesting sushi rolls in addition to the usual ones.Maybe a nice place to bring out-of-town visitors, but not some place I personally like to eat.", 
      "I've only ever had sushi at Kofusion, so that's what I'll base my review. As such, I've definitely had better sushi elswhere, but I think this place does have the best sushi in the area. As compared with others, Kofusion has a decent medium-sized selection of rolls. In addition, one dollar sushi definitely is enticing and worth your money. But if you don't go during one dollar sushi hours, it gets a bit pricey, as it should. I do believe that Kofusion's ambiance is interesting. It's a darker place, with glimmers of neon lights, kind of like a classy club.", 
      "Ehh...they bring you large ceramic plates with a little bit of food in the center. They call it \"New Age\" cuisine (aka money-saving cuisine).Service was not so great.", 
      "Never, ever again.This place is awful. Overpriced, bad food, and to top it off? TERRIBLE service. My friend ordered some type of roll, and she asked they do something different to it. Something minor. So, take a wild guess how many times it came out? Not once, not twice, not even three times...on the FOURTH try it was correct. And every time, the waitress getting increasingly ruder. Finally, before the last time, I asked to have the owner come out, which she did and was somewhat apologetic, but still acted like it was no big deal!I ordered a scallop curry dish. It was strange to say the least, and they cut the scallops in half crosswise! Bizarre, other than they were trying to make it look like my overpriced tiny \"sea\" scallops were worth it. They were the smallest sea scallops I've ever seen. I am from New England, but I am not expecting the same seafood in Illinois, but COME ON! You aren't fooling anyone. I am amazed anyone really thinks this is a 5 star place. It was the worst restaurant experience second only to the time I ate at Miko's...that was worse.", 
      "I am new to the area. I have have plenty of sushi and Ko Fusion is on My fav list", 
      "It's only worth coming here for the rolls. \u00a0Everything else that I've tried is a ridiculous ripoff.With that said, their \"fusion\" sushi actually works pretty well! \u00a0Apple smoked bacon and unagi roll? \u00a0Tasty indeed. \u00a0Their other novelty rolls are extremely tasty as well. \u00a0However, their traditional sushi isn't that great.Every other time we're in town we find ourselves getting the salmon triangles, which are truly unique in an onigiri sort of way. \u00a0It reminds me of that \"fan tuan\" at Taiwan 7-Elevens, cept with salmon! \u00a0This place is on the expensive side, but this is my favorite \"rolls\" place in Champaign. \u00a0Note that I say rolls, and not sushi in general.", 
      "I'm really not sure why people come here. Yes, I will admit the decor allows you a temporary escape of living in the midwest, but, that really the only thing going for it. I believe the quality of fish is extremely poor, over priced, and simply, not tasty. I have been there multiple times only to ask myself why? The only reason why I guess I decided to give it two stars instead of one is the service and drinks. Only saving grace.", 
      "We had dinner on Monday evening, $1 sushi night.Our entire experience was very nice, worthy of a return trip.Yet, what separates this dinner from all others was what happened after we finished. \u00a0We had finished, started getting ready to leave. William became upset because he couldn't find something he had brought with him. \u00a0 We got to the car, i went back in to ask if they found something (a toy) at our location to call me and i would return to pick it up. As i returned to the car, our waiter (Daniel) followed me out and had found the stylus that had been dropped by William.The food was good, the service with that little extra effort made our dinner excellent.", 
      "Food - Pretty good. \u00a0Buffet - Oddly good. \u00a0Small chafing dishes and it's bust so it is fresh. \u00a0Decor - like they went to Miami in the early 90's and stripped a low end night club.Service - pretty good for the most part. \u00a0I been there a few times now and I have had good , but a few bad too. \u00a0Once a girl that I had to point out the wine on the list, a Sauvignon Blanc, and she brought me a red??? \u00a0Another really bad server just would not leave us alone because it was slow, though I forgave it because he was REALLY hot, like most of their staff. \u00a0That should not matter, but I would rather look at a hot guy, then not.", 
      "Lunch Buffet = Awesome!!Much better deal than $1 sushi!They had korean glass noodles, red curry, egg rolls, tempuras, some kind of soup, and 3 sushi rolls, and probably more stuff that I left out. The food was all good.", 
      "People can say what they want about the sushi here. And, yes, I realize, that it might lack authenticity as some other places. The bottom line is, it's good and that is what food should be-good! The big roll and creamy shrimp are my favorites, with the popper (the ridiculous bacon, cream cheese, and fried) one is great. Also, the stir-fry is incredible. Just go and enjoy!", 
      "I like kofusion, although I mostly like it for the $1 sushi. \u00a0ONE DOLLAR SUSHI ON MONDAY NIGHTS! \u00a0Don't miss that shit. \u00a0The one dollar sushi is as american as it comes (ie fried, filled with cream cheese, and most often not raw) but it is one dollar. \u00a0ONE DOLLAR! \u00a0\rI've never eaten off the non-sushi menu, but I have had the sake mojito about a million times. \u00a0I did not like it as much as a rum mojito at first; not sweet enough, a little sour for a mojito, but it is quite distinctive and grows on me every time I have it. \u00a0\rThe ambience, I believe, is as good as it gets in champaign. \u00a0Nice tranquil water fountains and fish tanks and high def tvs with fishtanks and water fountains playing on them.\rService varies. \u00a0On one dollar sushi night it (understandably) takes a while for the food to come out, and the politeness of the wait staff during that lengthy interval is not always as high as it might be.", 
      "I can't believe I used to think this place was expensive. A few plaecs serve sushi in Champaign, Ko Fusion is probably ranked right in the middle. I've only eaten it on dollar sushi nights, which, now that I think about it, is a spectacular bargain.For a Champaign restaurant, Kofusion has a very modern look; frosted glass, colored lights, and random decorations add to the very un-Champaign look and feel, which is refreshing at times.I've also been told that they hold salsa nights here, though I haven't experienced it. Overall, great place on those dollar sushi nights. Can't say much for the rest.", 
      "Wow, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! Where to start? They have some of the best sushi in town! I usually get spicy tuna rolls. My husband is a bit more adventurous so I like to nosh on whatever he has ordered, too. Although I have never intentionally eaten uni, I can share that my husband loves to get a piece or two whenever we come.This place also has some great entree and dessert options. They have a great wagyu beef entree with potatoes and vegetables that is absolute perfection. Additionally, they have a trio of ice creams that are so, so delicious.Drinks are always good. Service is usually pretty good (they lose a point because this is not always the case). If you do not like overstimulation, avoid Kofusion unless it is warmer out. The outdoor seating is lovely but can lead to spending a lot of money on mojitos. It's worth it.", 
      "Too much for too little. I like the decor, the location, and I half-like the food. I hate the prices. I also hate it when people think that this is the best Sushi place in CU without trying the others.Sushi is expensive. I also understand that not just any restaurant gets access to high quality fish, especially in bumble fuck Chambana. None of these justify the price premium KoFusion demands over the (superior IMHO) Yelowfin, not to mention the also rans Kamakura and Miko. If decor doesn't matter, and cost is an object (when is it not?) Sushi Kame is the best bet.As for their rolls, I do think they can be good. When they are good, they are just as good as the above restaurants. When they are not, they suffer the same perennial complaints for not being well rolled or being skimpy. I have not heard any complaints that their fish was bad, and I grant that this in itself is an accomplishment. The chirashi is reputedly quite good, though I have not had it.Their \"deal night\" is not really a deal. They get you in with the promise of a cheap meal, but the pieces that are $1 each are really tiny. If you are a person who normally orders 2 rolls, you will not be happy with your 10 small (but good) pieces. You will end up ordering an additional roll and maybe more. If that additional roll isn't one of the ones that are in the 10 pieces for $10 deal, prepare to wait for an eternity and a half.", 
      "First, the positives: The sushi is actually very good! Also, if you want to splurge on desert, the ginger ice cream is good, too. I ate here with my family and, as I did, they all enjoyed the food.Unfortunately, that's all I have for the positives. The food, as good as it is, is overpriced. The atmosphere (which I admittedly can't speak in detail about since we were sitting outside) seemed...I don't know...off. However, by far the worst was the terrible service we received. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but our server really seemed to cop an attitude toward us and took FOREVER tending to our needs. Twice, someone from my party actually had to get up and retrieve him from whatever he was doing so he could actually, you know, do his job. This really should not happen, especially at a place that bills itself as such an upscale, better-than-the-average-restaurant kind of place.This really soured what should have been a great experience. I may give this place another chance some time. However, it'll be a while before I do. I guess if you really have a hankering for sushi, you could do worse. Just be aware of all the crap that comes with it.", 
      "Decent sushi for Champaign", 
      "Tried it out on dollar sushi sunday. Food (3/5)Overall the food was meh. Very heavy on sauce and some of the pieces were downright tiny. Granted they were $1 a piece. Pretty bad unagi - which I wouldn't think is that hard to mess up. Some of the rolls were tasty, but I could barely taste anything besides rice and sauce. Service (-10/5)Our waiter was easily the worst I've ever had. He was probably hungover - he mumbled the entire time and repeatedly spilled water. The rest of the staff seemed aloof and apathetic as well. \u00a0Ambiance (2/5)This is one ugly restaurant. It seemed clean enough, but the tacky fish tanks and lights did not foster any trust that I would be getting quality food.Overall (2/5)Maybe they had an off day. Maybe they slack on sundays. $1 sushi is the only redeeming quality.", 
      "My only complaint with Kofusion is that it is a little too loud.The food is all well executed and neatly plated. \u00a0I've eaten sushi from Niigata to New York, and while the nigiri clearly isn't as fresh as it could be (being that Kofusion is a thousand miles away from any ocean), I think the maki here is pretty darn good.", 
      "My friend and I came to Kofusion on a Tuesday, so it was not nearly as crowded as on dollar sushi nights (Sundays AND Mondays). \u00a0The first thing you notice is the d\u00e9cor: \u00a0indoor seating is cozy, with an outdoor patio section, ambient lighting and nice candles on the tables (a small detail, but something I love :) \u00a0 \u00a0My friend had sushi rolls while I had select pieces of nigiri (salmon, smoked salmon, tuna, shrimp, and tuna caviar). \u00a0Now this review may be biased due to the weeks of sushi-deprivation I had experienced prior to coming in...but the food was delicious! \u00a0The pieces were well-cut, artfully arranged, and you could tell the fish was good quality. \u00a0The best part of the night (aside from the great company) was the service. \u00a0The waiter was very friendly, entertaining, and came by many times to checkup on us. \u00a0The service really took the whole dining experience up a notch. \u00a0 \u00a0P.S. \u00a0The mojitos were great too! \u00a0Will definitely be coming back for more sushi and drinks nights.", 
      "Great date night! Pork belly tacos are a must! DO NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU TRY THEM...seriously. The sushi was great! Some of the best I've had. Nice atmosphere and good drinks. Recommend going on Thursdays though. Sushi is half off!", 
      "While the restaurant was gorgeous and the staff was well trained, I must say for the price you are paying I expect to get super fresh tasting fish. I ordered the chirashi (my go to dish at sushi places when I am not sharing) And while the portion was decent, \u00a0the tuna and octopus both tasted slightly off, like it was old. The other fish on the plate, \u00a0while fresh, just didn't have a lot of flavor. In short you pay a lot for pretty average fish, almost 1.5-2x what I would pay for the quality I recieved(depending on the dish) \u00a0there are many better places in the area, that have tastier fish and are a bit more reasonably priced.", 
      "Probably about as cool as the Champaign dining scene gets...at least from my limited exposure to it. In a town, though, lacking in nicer Asian fare, it's disappointing that Kofusion's menu strays into French, American and Italian food, but I guess that's why \"fusion\" is in the name of the restaurant. My dinner selections focused on Japanese items, which were of high quality - sashimi pieces were HUGE and sushi rolls, while small, were mostly tasty. I was fairly impressed at how fresh the fish was, but taken aback by how costly the sushi was.Patrons seemed to mostly be from the university - a bunch of students and some professorial types. Kofusion certainly is the place to see and be seen in downtown Champaign and it's going to be a place I'll surely check out every time I visit the in-laws.", 
      "I've eaten here a lot because I enjoy the sushi, but most of the time i've received food I just get it to go. The service is truly not the best and it's disappointing. One time I waited 25 minutes before even getting greated and another 2-3 minutes after the other 3 in my party arrived. The last time in town I went and sat at the bar yet time passed and nobody was there. I flagged down the host to see if they even had a bartender on staff and they grabbed one girl who got me started, some other guy showed up and said he entered my food, then some other guy finished as I was looking around for \"bartender: #2\" to get my check. Literally (sort of literally), the only good thing from here is the food.", 
      "My absolute favorite place for fresh sushi in Champaign by far! (Don't forget the $1 sushi on Mon nights!) I've had the stir fry, scallops, tofu and lots of other dishes there too and all were pretty delicious and unique. It's a really good restaurant to go to for something different although I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone.I will say that it's really hard to not enjoy the atmosphere. The soothing neon lights, aquariums, and smooth lines of the sushi bar are pretty marvelous on the eyes. Not only that but the location is perfect because after you're done, there are tons of other bars to go to for an after-dinner drink or two. Overall, its totally worth it!", 
      "OK. I have been to KoFusion many times, but it had been almost a year between my visit last night and the time before that...I basically gave up on them a year ago, and last night proved me right because of the two siple but way too important Cons... so here is my list of Pros and Cons... decide for yourselves!Pros:Downtown, cool atmosphere, always busyGreat decor, very cleanFriendly staff and quick serviceSurprisingly fresh sushi, and excellent entree dishesCons:TOTALLY, horribly overpriced (especially compared to Kamakura)Lots of the sushi rolls (with the exception of the extremely simple rolls)are over-the-top and too complicated or too fried...they don't seem Asian at allHmph.", 
      "YUM. The BEST sushi in all of Champaign. Monday nights are dollar sushi nights (a great deal) and I try to make it here at least 2 or 3 times when I come back to visit for Christmas. The big roll (their special house roll) is amazing and huge. I've had many other unique and interesting sushis here as well. Edamame is also quite tasty. And the peach tea is some of the best tea I've ever had. The decor is pretty stylin and if you come at the right time, you don't have to wait very long, if at all, to get a table. Never had an entree here, only sushi.", 
      "It's better than the worst reviews here say. I too came on dollar sushi day so obviously the price was just right. The waitstaff was a little harried but it was extremely busy, but they really tried very hard to be attentive. Brian, our server was racing back and forth and came by often to check but when I did need something it was a little hard to get him. He did get back with me as soon as he could with any request I had and was quick with the refills of their Jasmine/Green tea.I got a couple pieces of their $ sushi. The waygu beef was really good, and it was cooked all right-not over done-the right shade of pink. The dynamite roll was also really tasty-really savory and I was surprised that they didn't skimp on the fish.I also got the Hwe Dop Bop which our server didn't know what it was until I pointed it out on the menu. Hwe Dop Bop, by the way is like bibimbap but with sashimi, like the Korean version of chirashi. It didn't come with the 'spicy, red sauce' that it was supposed to come with and I brought this up and he said it already comes with but he could bring me more-that was a little weird that he didn't even look at my dish. However, he did bring me more without asking when I used up what he gave me. Not a bad place, I would probably show up here again if I'm in the CU area, but probably not for $1 sushi-too busy.", 
      "Despite looking like the children's exhibits at the Shedd Aquarium, KoFusion has some respectable food. The main reason is that they seem really good at sourcing the best ingredients. Everything on the menu seems to have a pedigree: Immerwald Farms Pork, wild line-caught fish, and Wagyu beef are typical menu items.Dinner can get quite pricey, but the service is good and the food is delicious. I can't say it's as creative as other establishments in town, but it's done well. I also love that they have meats like wild boar on the menu. The exception is Sunday and Monday, which is $1 sushi night. The sushi isn't the greatest, but it's decent enough and I'll merrily eat it despite the fact that you aren't supposed to eat seafood on those days because they are probably leftovers. Oh well. Lunch is far more affordable, especially on Mondays when they have $1 Sushi. I think the Bento Box, which has quite a lot of food, is a good deal. Recently it's had salmon cake, California rolls, Wagyu beef/organic chicken, rice, vegetables, and a salad, but the contents vary. I think I could make two meals out of it and they do allow takeout, but usually I devour it pretty quickly because it's so good.Many people think the interior here is suave, but if you look at it long enough it just looks tacky.", 
      "Honestly, I rarely frequented this place when it wasn't a Sunday or Monday Night ($1 sushi night), maybe once or twice when I had a craving.But I'm smart enough to go on the $1 nights so I don't feel bad (was then a college student). \u00a0On regular nights - it can be seen as pricey. On $1 night, it is awesome. I love the big roll. If you are a first time Sushi eater, try that one first, it is like a flavor party in your mouth. Anything with crab is easy peasy for a first timer. It was my first one.I slowly ventured into others and now I can eat almost anything and usually love them all. Most of their $1 sushi is delicious. If you are vegetarian, don't run away, their veggie futo roll/vegetarian maki is gross, but get the one you can custom make and have them tempura fry it, they might give u some crap about not being able to tempura fry it but they can and it will be yummy, I guarantee it!They also have tiramisu, which is great because I love it. And a bunch of other fusion dishes for the non-sushi eaters. I don't know why people complain about the decor, despite the glass bricks, it has a pretty cool contemporary/marina style...which kind of makes sense, duh.", 
      "This place has an interesting atmosphere inside, but we loved eating on the patio. We had tasty salmon cakes and good mussels as appetizers. The sake sangria was interesting and refreshing (and a generous portion). The volcano rolls were delicious, and the tiramisu was a fantastic end to the meal. The server was very pleasant too.", 
      "Swanky for a Shampoo Banana restaurant, so if you want to class it up to impress that special someone, Kofusion is a great choice.Food-wise it's not quite as impressive...though the sushi is pretty good. The entrees are hit or miss -- I've had some stellar meals here, but sometimes they seem to be having off days.", 
      "I was in Urbana, IL for a few days on business. I dined at two restaurants and this was one of them.The place was rather empty, but that's because it was Halloween evening.With that being said, the interior design is pretty cool but feels a bit cold. I had a couple of things on the menu. I had the halibut as my main dish and the california roll just for fun. I was very stuffed by the end of the evening. I liked both dishes.I think Ko Fusion needs to focus on one cuisine. It's trying to be everything to everyone. But what I had was tasty. The outside signage says 'Steak Pizza Sushi Seafood.' What the hell kinda combination is that? I'd go back if I was in town. :)", 
      "I would give this place 2.5 stars.There was nothing really terrible about kofusion but there wasn't anything that great about it either!Atmosphere- fine. A little sparkly for my taste but whatever. It was busy, otherwise sitting outside on the patio would have been much nicer.Service- I know it was busy but the service was a mess. The food came out really fast but none of us had chopsticks, or soy sauce, or ginger, or wasabi, and they were about to just leave us! Not to mention trying to get a drink!Food- pretty bland and mushy with a couple good standouts on my sampler plate. I swear, one of the bad ones must have been the bologna of the sea because it looked/tasted like a hunk of spam stuffed into a roll form topped with some sauce. I spit that one out. There were a couple good pieces that after I try every other sushi restaurant in C-U I might come back for.", 
      "I was in a business in Champaign and asked the employee there for a recommendation for Japanese food/sushi. \u00a0He said Kofusion, so I looked it up Yelp.In spite of the assorted poor reviews, I went to Kofusion for dinner anyway, since it was Monday and I read (here) that it's Dollar Sushi on Monday. \u00a0It took a few minutes even to get to the hostess, who said there was a long wait (the place was packed), but I could sit at the bar immediately. \u00a0She responded in the affirmative when I asked if I could order from the same menu.So sit at the bar I did. \u00a0For the uninitiated, the 'dollar sushi' is per PIECE, not per ROLL. \u00a0So, calculate accordingly. \u00a0However, these are not your regular old California rolls, or good ole spicy tuna, salmon skin roll, etc. \u00a0These are fancier and more intricate rolls, and priced rather low. \u00a0Take a look: \u00a0kofusion.com/?page_id=255I didn't have any idea which would be the best, so I got the sampler (10 pieces, $10). \u00a0Actually I got 2 orders :-)It's a little hard figuring out which piece was which sometimes, but the bartender offered to help me several times, and they left the menu with me, which I thought was a nice touch, so I could cross-reference what I was eating. The sushi was totally worth it. \u00a0 \u00a0Reading the other reviews, the only thing I can surmise is that the bad reviews came from people who had to wait too long, or maybe the staff has been changed recently. \u00a0I had no problem with anyone there; the hostess, the two bartenders who served me, and a woman, who may have been the owner(?) who came and very nicely asked me to move one barstool over so she could seat a party of two next to eachother.Parking is a problem here as with anywhere near the university. \u00a0There was a sign on the door saying they validate 2 hour parking for a parking lot, but since I didn't know that, didn't know where the lot was, and had already fed the meter on the street, I didn't think anything of it.The decor was nice, especially against the backdrop of the other restaurants I had been in since driving around eastern Illinois and western Indiana for the past few days.Go to Kofusion and get sushi- \u00a0you won't regret it.", 
      "I really only go here for the $1 sushi night, can get pretty pricey otherwise. \u00a0Love the monday night sushi specials, they make up a menu of 10 rolls that may not be traditional but are absolutely delicious like a grilled kobe beef roll or a roll topped with salsa. \u00a0I always order the \"sampler\", a hot sake, and some edamame to start off. \u00a0They also have more traditional stuff for purists and a large organic menu of seafood-restaurant-style dishes.Haven't found any other sushi place in town that is as good. \u00a0And it has a really cool almost over-trendy atmosphere, so it's a place you can go to for a special occasion or just whenever.", 
      "I have been here many times for the $1 sushi as well as the lunch buffet.For the $1 sushi, the Big Roll is a must. It's convenient that if you order and are still hungry, you can order some more- even if it's only a couple pieces. It's a great way to test out some of their menu options without breaking your bank.The lunch buffet is outstanding- they always offer 3 types of sushi in addition to edamame, spring/egg rolls, rice, and chicken & beef dishes. It's hard to pick what to put on your plate.The specialty cocktails are pretty good too, if a little pricey.Overall, if you get a deal it's worth it, but I've definitely had better sushi.", 
      "Love this place!!!!! \u00a0No better place on Sunday and Monday for $1 Sushi! \u00a0Janet, her husband and her staff have always treated us like \u00a0family. \u00a0Janet is the face of the restaurant and has a fantastic memory as well as a great business mind. \u00a0The location is perfect and the design is breath taking. \u00a0She \u00a0recognizes us when we come in, greets \u00a0us warmly and always has a nice word to say. \u00a0The food is fresh, portions are ample and taste is delicious. \u00a0Our favorites are the specialty roles; maybe a little more expensive but soooo worth it. \u00a0Enjoy!", 
      "Don't care about the decor or anything. I've only gone on Sunday/Monday so I can't speak to the restaurant on Tuesday-Saturday. At the same time, I'll probably keep going. I really like the tuna crunch roll, like a lot. As oddly specific as this might be, it is in my top 5 pieces of sushi ever. The bulk of my 10-12 pieces usually consist of these guys. I also enjoy the wagyu beef and BBQ pork roll, which are sort of a nice change up. People also seem to enjoy the big roll, though I take a pass because I'm not a fan of mushrooms.OK, so that necessarily doesn't earn the 4 star rating. It's good, relatively inexpensive (unless you're trying to eat 392 pieces) and the location is good. What gets the extra star is that the service is always on point and great. Knowing that people cherry picking what types of sushi they want can cause an error prone environment, the servers (and I suppose cooks/sushi-makers) usually get it right. When they don't, it's fixed quickly.Awesome!"

      "Ok, there's no denying how much we all love the Big Roll. It's why we all eat here. When I worked at Aroma I would get dollar sushi to go every Sunday. And any aroma employee from 2010-2011 will attest that my order was wrong EVERY time. When I say \"every\" I sincerely mean every single time. There was once that I had the best service of my life, but that was about 4 years ago. Recently I was home and went on a Sunday afternoon. Our waitress was so bad. After we had been seated for 15 min my buddy asked the host if anyone was going to wait on us. A girl came over and flatly took our drink order. After we bagan eating my same buddy had to flag the girl down every time we needed our drinks refilled. Maybe she was having a really bad day in her personal life....because she was not interested in being a waitress whatsoever. The food was good tho. Lol.And while we got shitty service it prompted us to all swap horror stories we've heard about the owner. Seems everyone in town knows someone who worked here for like a day...Or was hired at an interview and never contacted again. And is the owner un aware that the cheap plastic crap in the fish tanks looks like crystal dildos? Everyone I've taken here comments in the penises in the fish tanks.God damn it.....I'll be back....you'll be back......we just love that Big Roll for $1!!!!!!!!", 
      "Best place for sushi. Ever. It can be a little pricey but that's why you go on Sundays or Mondays when its $1 a piece. I've tried the steak and noodles here which are really good too. But my favorite is still the sushi. The service can be slow when the place is packed, but I've never had anything worse than that. The deserts are really really good too. Go for the creme brulee or the fried cheesecake. This is definitely a place to go to on a date or when you're in the mood to go out with friends at night. Has a classy yet casual feel to it.", 
      "I've gone here for dollar sushi Mondays, weekday lunch buffets (one of the best ever), birthday dinners and other celebrations. It has a great ambiance and terrific sushi! Their regular dishes are phenomenal too. I highly recommend you try the lunch buffet sometime, though. They had this savory caramelized chicken dish that blew my mind. Their desserts are great too. It's always a great experience!", 
      "Love hate here. Had good experiences snd horrible. Overall i usually have a good meal and i like the decor. Expensive for the area but a good date night place.", 
      "Diners beware!!! \u00a0I have never been to a restaurant that so blatantly tried to up-sell everything! \u00a0The rolls are really pretty big but the waitress suggested 2 rolls per person, \u00a0The menu doesn't give you a clue as to how large the rolls are so it is really easy to fall for the suggestion. \u00a0The waitress gave us a bunch of recommendations. Essentially, the waitress told us that \u00a0every roll over $17 is \"REALLY good\". \u00a0Some were & some weren't. \u00a0Of course, the waitress suggested dessert. \u00a0We passed.The restaurant offers various specials, including an Asian buffet until 1:30 pm on Saturdays. \u00a0I would highly recommend finding out what the specials are and planning your visit based on the specials. \u00a0The lobster roll WAS really tasty but PASS on the flaming phoenix roll. \u00a0If I go again I will order 1 roll at a time & see how that goes. \u00a0The place is expensive enough without the wait staff trying to upsell at every turn. \u00a0I'm still irritated by the tactics", 
      "All I can say is, this place much too overpriced for what it's trying to sell. You leave feeling like you were ripped off rather than satisfied. Sushi was very below average and I found the selection of nigiri sparse. I don't think it would have been as upsetting if it wasn't so expensive, but even if were priced less, I still cannot say that it was delicious. My bf and I had one drink, one $15-16 maki roll (only five pieces on the plate though), nigiri (2 pieces at 2 bucks a piece), and sushi plate B (which had very few actual sushi for the price) and it was around $70 something. I could not believe it because that was my grocery bill for the whole week and I got a measly meal. We both left still feeling empty in the stomach. I'm not a super chef, but I know how to cook and even to make sushi myself. The rice used was not right. Sushi rice is not the rice you just scoop out of your pot or rice cooker rolled into shapes. There is a preparation process for the rice which adds rice wine vinegar, sweetness, and brings out a slight chewiness that complements the raw fishes and whatnots. KoFusion didn't even do this.The fish was not very flavorful either. The amount of rice used for the nigiri was about 2/3 the proper amount. Rolls were shot with a shrink ray. Everything was just off. The decor was really, I dunno ... just very odd. It's the like uncool kid trying to be really cool. There was neon, walls with bubbles, odd colors, tiles, weird blue lighting, odd shapes. I dunno, maybe this is what is \"trendy\" back then or something but it looks really odd to me. The waiters were fine. i was surprised to hear that our waiter has worked there for over two years. She knew what she was doing. I'm not looking for heaping portions, exquisite tastes at dirt cheap prices. I just want a good portioned meal, tastes good to the average person, and at a reasonable price. KoFusion missed the mark on all of them. Maybe it was just that night or because of new management. I remember KoFusion actually used to be good several years ago. \u00a0I was shocked to see how different the quality of food that is being served now. Small portion, wallet shrinking, bland and poorly made sushi. Oh and odd decor.", 
      "Although KoFusion claims to sell only wild-caught seafood, this is not true. \u00a0For example, they serve Kona kampachi, which is the brand name for a fish sold by a farm in Hawaii. On top of that, they do not label which fish is farmed and which is wild. So, the only thing you can do is ask. \u00a0And, I would also ask whether the meat you're ordering is actually organic, because if the restaurant is willing to mislead their customers about the fish, I wouldn't trust them about the meat either! Why anyone would want to patronize a restaurant that has so little respect for the customers that it lies to them about about what's on the menu?", 
      "The sushi here is excellent. \u00a0Very high marks for the mango coconut roll, it was FANTASTIC (with the added bonus of being one of the more reasonably priced items on the menu). \u00a0I would have given 4 stars, but our waitress recommended a specialty roll that wasn't on the menu, she said it was her favorite, so we gave it a try. \u00a0It was very spicy, and it was about $4 or $5 more than any other roll on the menu. \u00a0It would have been nice if she disclosed both of those facts while recommending it.", 
      "Love the fresh ingredients! Dollar sushi days give you a chance to try different things, good variety. Best sake mojitos EVER!", 
      "This place is grossly overpriced and the only day that is worth going is probably sushi night on Mondays. It says that it's $1 sushi but what they didn't tell you is that it's $1 a piece and only limited to 10 selections; AND you have to order the entire 10-piece sampler. Very tricky indeed. On other days, a 8-10-piece sushi roll can be about $8-$15. The ambience is great and this place is definitely wonderful for parties and gatherings. Worth a try.", 
      "I had the $1 sushi here and it was average. Most of the $1 sushi had cream cheese or tempura as a filler which is why I'm sure it's only a buck a piece. I did not think that the fish quality here was very high as compared to other major cities but it *is* Champaign so I guess it's understandable. The service was good, and the location and ambiance were nice as well.", 
      "I think people like this place based on the fact that it's a \"trendy\" little place in Champaign and they probably feel cool going there. \u00a0The decor reminds me of IKEA with fish tanks and the food and drinks are decent, nothing spectacular. I do like the fact that it 's downtown and has an outside patio- which is awesome in the summer! All in all, not a bad place, just not worth all the hype.", 
      "Okay, I know it isn't close to STL, but if you're ever in the Champaign- Urbana area you must check this place out. First of all, they only serve organic meats and wild-caught seafood. Second of all, the menu is amazing- so many choices! Small plates, sushi, entrees, great appetizers, wine list, etc. We started with edamame and a dragon roll, I had a vegetable stir-fry (b/c I was feeling kind of basic) and they had wild boar on special that was delicious and not gamey at all (I had to try a bite of a friends'). The open floor plan, changing lights and fish tanks make this place a fun place to sit and have a meal, too. Our waiter was one of the nicest guys I've talked to in a long time, and he was quick with a refill or a table clear. Also, this place serves a delicious mojito made with sake instead of rum. Best drink ever!", 
      "I've been to Kofusion for lunch twice now. \u00a0Both times I have enjoyed the food and the ambiance. \u00a0My favorite is the Big Roll. \u00a0Although, they really need to hire better servers (or train them better.) \u00a0Not impressed with their knowledge or service manner.", 
      "P.S. Dollar sushi has been extended to Sundays as well!", 
      "Great sushi and I especially love dollar sushi nights (sunday and monday nights). \u00a0Everything seems really fresh and the sushi rolls are a bit more inventive than other sushi places in the area. A little on the pricy side for most of the week. \u00a0Great atmosphere, service can be a little slow earlier in the afternoon, or during dollar sushi nights (it's always really busy).", 
      "The atmosphere here is terrific. The interior is replete with huge fish tanks with lights that keep changing colors, and a waterfall. They also have a large outdoor garden.My boyfriend lives in NYC and Chicago for many years, and says that this is the best sushi he has ever had.I normally order a korean noodle dish. The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are wonderful, but they use chili oil instead of fresh chilis, so it makes it too greasy.If you adore chocolate, you must must must order the Valhrona chocolate gelato. You will realize you have never really eaten \"chocolate\" before!The service can be a little slow, even when the restaurant is not busy, but the servers are knowledgeable and friendly.", 
      "Food is generally good but the service has been hit or miss. The servers tend to get noticeably overwhelmed on busy night (e.g. dollar sushi) and there can be long delays. The quality of the food is high and Ko-Fusion does a good job of simulating your typical big city Asian-Fusion, neon lights, lounge music type place. The dollar sushi is a great deal and the rotating options are tasty though sort of cheapish in that they feature a lot of imitation crab based rolls. However for a buck a piece, it's a fair enough trade-off. On my last visit, my gf and I each ordered tea and the server forget which pot was which. To check she practically shoved her nose in one pot to take a whiff and figure it out. Ko-Fusion is good but not great.", 
      "I went there for lunch and did not partake in the buffet. \u00a0My parties food took FOREVER!!! \u00a0I was told it was because we did not order the buffet even though we ordered before most of the other parties were sat. \u00a0Lunch took almost two hours. \u00a0Unacceptable! \u00a0No apology and preferential treatment was given to other tables. \u00a0The food was mediocre at best. \u00a0Won't be going there again.", 
      "I debated, 3 or 4 stars, but went with 3 for now until I try it again. The lunch buffet was fairly interesting and a great way to try various foods, including the sushi. Get there early for the buffet as it got crowded at noon. I got there quite early and was a disappointed in the temperature of the food; it already seemed to be getting cold.", 
      "I loved the vibe of this place and our server was excellent, but the prices are outrageous. It's ludicrous for a place to charge $8 for a California roll and $10 for a spicy tuna. The food was above average sushi, but come on! I get that it may be more expensive to get fresh fish to Campaign than Chicago, but I didn't expect to be giving my arm and my leg to pay for a specialty roll. \u00a0I can see why the place is a huge draw when they have specials, but I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot poll if you are paying full price.", 
      "I received a recommendation to eat here from the driver at my hotel. She loved a specific salad and thought I might enjoy the restaurant. I arrived to a beautiful restaurant with a friendly staff. I moved outside, as the night was warm. I ordered wine and asked the server to return so that I could order my appetizer. The restaurant was virtually empty, but she took a very long time. Eventually, I placed my order. I received my dinner before my appetizer. I ordered the seafood cheese springroll. It was not good. There is no other way to say it. It tasted like cream cheese in a spring roll. The crab and pollack was missing in action. I couldnt finish it and the server never asked me how it was. The entree itself, a stirfry dish with panang curry was delicious. It wasnt the best I've tasted, but it was still very good. Now..with my wine glass empty and half of my entree gone, I waited for the server to order more wine. She never came. After 20 minutes, I got up and asked the hostess for my server. The hostess was going home so couldnt help me. I waited a bit more and then asked again for the waitress. After half an hour, a young lady came out and said, I'm sorry but your server went home. The manager never came out to explain. No one asked if I needed or wanted anything. She just said, your server went home and gave me a check. I looked at the bill and realized that she had overcharged me. The seafood yuck was on the menu for $8, but she charged me $10. Then, I had to wait for her to call the manager and for him to fix the bill. Still, he did not appear in this very empty restaurant. He called from the back and said I fixed it. He took $5.00 off instead of the overcharge of $2.00. Perhaps this was to placate me. How about, Oh, I'm so sorry that we sent your server home without giving you another server. Oh, you didnt like the seafood springroll, can we get you something else instead. Nothing. I left the restaurant and determine that I would never go back again. It was definitely below the level of a good restaurant. Below fair as well. I guess this means poor.", 
      "Went here when we were visiting some friends at U of I & ... I'm sorry, but for their prices, the sushi could be A LOT better. I'm not really a sushi snob and I'm definitely down for paying a good amount of money for really good sushi. This place gave me mediocre sushi for a higher price. No thanks. Also, they messed up my order & this chef (who literally looked like he just rolled out of bed b/c he looked so disheveled) gave me a lecture about their fish & how I was mistaken. If I wanted a lecture with my food, I'd go to class & eat. Relearn how to treat your customers, make your sushi taste amazing & present it in a way where I want to cry... then I'll come back. Till then, I'd rather just eat cocomero all day when I'm there.", 
      "I have a couple of things to say about this place. \u00a0First - this place is light years better than Miko, even thought they're owned by the same people. \u00a0That doens't say much, however, since Miko's food sucks big time. \u00a0I love Ko Fusion sushi - it's creative and the ingredients are top notch. \u00a0But seriously, the price is ridiculous considering Sushi Kame makes rolls almost as good for half the price and none of the attitude. \u00a0The fish entrees are always good here, but stay away from non-asian dishes - especially pastas or anything Italian. \u00a0You would do better with a frozen dinner and I'm not kidding!", 
      "I've only been here for dollar sushi, so keep that in mind. I actually like the sushi here. The service has been mostly good. You'd think the wait would be crazy, but I've not really had to wait very long. They get you in and out, but it doesn't feel rushed. And $10 for a full sushi dinner is pretty good in my books. I want to try on another night, just to check out the entrees.", 
      "As always, a great experience on our last visit Monday night. The place was packed! But we were seated quickly, our server was attentive, and the food was great! \u00a0We just went in for drinks and sushi this time, but have several favorites from the menu as well. My son loves the veggie dumplings. \u00a0The Chicago roll is delicious. \u00a0A fun night out! \u00a0Also, great to see the owner in the front of the house. Very nice evening out!", 
      "This place has really good tea, esp the jasmine tea. The food seems overpriced.", 
      "I would not recommend going to this place any other nights/days then Sunday & Monday which is when most of their sushi/maki rolls are only $1 each! The food here is amazing! I would highly recommend the big roll and the volcano, my two favorites. I could probably live off of it. Their miso soup is excellent, and for desert try the red bean ice cream, sounds strange, but its delicious! They also have a great selection of martinis to pick from. The service is always iffy, but the last couple times we have lucked out with good servers. But either way you can usually find me here on a Sunday or Monday getting my fill of yummy yummy sushi!", 
      "This place has totally acceptable food, some of it rather tasty, and it's super pretty inside. But gotdamn, it's expensive. I'm not used to the sushi prices here. I've lived in bigger cities with better sushi for super cheap. You can't do much better than this place in this area, I guess.", 
      "Great sushi. \u00a0Had my first date here with my wife two and a half years ago. \u00a0Glad the food was too-notch!", 
      "the place looks like an A+++ restaurant, but the food is only B grade!!its pretty decent, but DESTIHL across the street is far better!! \u00a0the oysters are just straight up oysters, no sauce or nothing so just fyi...the entree was duck and it was okay, nothing spectacular...the sushi, was only mediocre...", 
      "Omg amazing! Ambience was awesome. Server was super awesome. Best sushi I've had and the drinks were great. I will definitely be coming back!", 
      "Good sushi, but the price is that of a GREAT sushi place. \u00a0Maybe I just got spoiled in California with amazing and cheap sushi but the only thing that made me stand up and take notice about Kofusion was the check. \u00a0It is still the best sushi place in CU so I'll be back. \u00a0My wallet just won't be happy.", 
      "Horribly overpriced, but on Mondays the specials are a good buy and a delight of variety. \u00a0I won't come any other day of the week, but on Monday this place is a go-to-spot for sushi. \u00a0Good service but occasionally a little slow.", 
      "Overpriced and underwhelming. Atmosphere leaves much to be desired - imagine an 80's dance club with an underwater theme- filled with CU's yuppies who think this is the place to \"See and Be Seen.\" We went for \"Dollar Sushi\" - each BITE is $1...not each roll. I know sushi can be expensive, but I thought it would be something more of \"Chef's Choice\" trying to use up what wasn't purchased over the weekend. You're better off going a different night to avoid the crowds and just order the rolls you like. The rolls themselves were decent, but not the best I've had.", 
      "I continue to eat here when I'm visiting campus, and I don't know why. The sushi is okay at best, and overpriced. The atmosphere is tacky.", 
      "This is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in Champaign. I spent four years in C-U, and came back here several times, most of which for Dollar Roll Night.Although many reviews have said that the service is slow, particularly on Dollar Roll Nights (Sunday and Monday nights), I have never had this experience. I would go with a friend or six, and the service was always fast enough that no one would really complain. Prices are a bit on the high side, but the quality of the food justifies that, both on and off the Sushi menu. Seriously though, the non-sushi menu is very good and highly underrated.If there is one drawback to Ko-Fusion, it is that it can get very noisy during dinner service, particularly on Dollar Roll Nights. However, the food is good, the service is not as bad as people make it out to be, and the food justifies the prices.", 
      "Service good, great sushi, love their organic-wild caught-natural food selection such as Scottish Salmon, grass fed beef etc. Sometime have brown rice. Nice atmosphere, bit modern, lovely patio", 
      "I am a sushi lover and i have never had anything but the best here!", 
      "Came here from out of town. My friend said this was the best sushi she has ever had. I have had a lot of sushi all across this nation and I have to say....it was excellent. The server was polite and very prompt with our needs. \u00a0If you like sushi I would recommend this place."

      "Fantastic smokey pig value.I followed the smell of smoked meat here; good start. Ordered the 8oz rib tips with a spicy pickle, hot BBQ sauce on the side. Flavor of meat was perfectly smokey with good bark, though drier than most (which I prefer to gum-able, fall off the bone). I found the sauce to be too sweet, tasted like apple pie, but wasn't unpleasant when combined with the rib tips; definitely get it on the side. Not very hot for being 'hot'.Pickle was very good. \u00a0Fries were fine.Very good portion size and quality for a meal under $7. Atmosphere is what every bbq place should be.If I lived here, I'd get takeout and make my own mustard sauce.", 
      "This place has my favorite rib tips and side bread. The price is very reasonable and they serve a large amount of food for their price. I didn't give it a five because the restaurant is small and kind of dirty. So I do take puts for most of them times.", 
      "Porgies has been a staple of my life since birth. Tub o tips, extra spicy sauce, and the sweet taste of a jumbo lemon shake up can make the gloomiest of days shine bright. Perfect for an afternoon snack or a late-night feast, I recommend Porgys to any food loving soul.", 
      "Lil'porgies is great, I frequent every other Wednesday with my mentee from the CU one to program. Porgies is fast, you order and your eating. Be sure to get your favorite sauce on the side, I like to eat my fries and pour as I go. Portions are right for a nice price with speedy service. Great for a quick eat.", 
      "I don't know why the hell I KEEP GOING to this place when I know that I can't chew threw the rib tips! I don't know what there doing to the poor meat to just dry it up like that!!! Geeze! Maybe it's the BBQ sauce that I crave from time to time. I'm not going here again. Damnit! So unhappy and STILL hungry!", 
      "My favorite BBQ place in town. I've made it a ritual of coming here every sunday for their half chicken ($6- half chicken, extra spicy BBQ sauce on the side, LG lemon shake up/coke, fries, and 2 pc bread) This meal will keep me very full and satisfied. I'm not sure if all the specials comes with a drink.. maybe you would have to ask the cashier because sometimes they don't put it in when you order. I really like their spicy pickle spear ($.10 each) When I'm not here on Sunday, I usually come for the rib tips. I'd get the regular order because the large order is really not that much more. I've never gotten the bucket of tips so I'm not sure how that comes out. tips:-order extra sauce ON THE SIDE (so it doesn't soak up ur bread and fries)-Half chicken or rib tipsThere's free parking and the service is extremely fast so your in and out very fast.", 
      "Found this BBQ place last year when we came to Bloomington Gold Corvette Show. It was excellent. So of course we had to go again this year. Little lady at the counter taking orders was super nice. Polish and sweet tea made our day.", 
      "yes yes yes yes yes, this place is legit due to the fact that you get huge portions for a very low price. Daily specials are all worth trying out, personally half chicken + fries + drink on sunday is my favorite.Another thing worth trying out is their 2 pound rib tips. so much food for 15 dollars. always get their sauce on the side, they give you way more sauce and you can use it to dip your fries and bread in too.i prefer mixed on the side", 
      "Ordered slab of ribs and ribs were over cooked. There was supposed to be bread with the ribs but could not find the bread until I looked under the American fries and then found the bread all soggy. Other people in party ordered pork sandwich. Thought it would be pulled pork but was not. That would not have been so bad though but meat was cold. No decor to speak of and not friendly people to deal with. Would not go to again.", 
      "This place is AWESOME. I am a university student from Chicago and have had my share of barbecue - Smoque from Chicago, Black Dog, etc. Out of all the barbecue places I have had, I can honestly say that Lil Porgy's is my favorite. My GO-TO is definitely the RIB TIPS (tub o tips can feed 2-3 guys) and the 1/2 chicken with mixed on the side. Some of my best college memories include the tub of tips. So good. Make sure to get the sauce on the side!!! This place is awesome and I will definitely crave it when I leave campus.Tips:-From personal experience, the springfield location seems to have better rib tips and the university location has better chicken.-There are daily specials (I love the Sunday special: 1/2 chicken, fries, and lemon shakeup for $5)-RIB TIPS + MIX ON THE SIDE.", 
      "Pros: Huge drinks, huge portions, and getting your order before you even leave the window. It's also pretty darn cheap! Pretty good sauces, too.Cons: The ribs are a bit dry, and the sides are meh, or at least hovering around the meh vicinity. I think I ordered cole slaw and beans on the side, and they came in little shot-glass sized things. At that size, what's the point?I went there once and it was pretty good, but I'm not going back there regularly unless I have a huge case of the munchies.", 
      "Went here during lunch, service was quick, and when food came out it was fresh and delicious. \u00a0I would strongly recommend this place to anyone.", 
      "This place has the best BBQ hands down! \u00a0You can actually get it delivered now. The Sunday special is their best deal with half a chicken, fries, two slices of white bread and an insanely HUGE cup of sweet iced tea or lemon shake-up for around 6 bucks. \u00a0You get a choice of mild, mixed, hot or extra hot BBQ sauce. \u00a0I'd recommend getting the sauce on the side and getting the mixed if you like spiciness, but still want to taste your food.Their rack of ribs is pretty good and they have turkey legs, if you're a fan. \u00a0They cook everything right on the grill and you can get a whole lot of food for your money. \u00a0Lil porgy's has turned into a Sunday afternoon tradition.", 
      "This place has wicked good BBQ at super low prices. \u00a0The sauce here is tart and vinegary. \u00a0When they say spicy, it actually is a bit.They cook the meat over wood, for pete's sake. \u00a0Imparts a great flavor.The only reason they are not 5 stars is the sides. \u00a0Just aren't great. \u00a0The bread is insipid; fries ok, but how hard is it to get fries wrong?Counter service is ok; not problematic, not dynamic customer service, either.It's not really a hang out an' chill place, very chow down and git atmosphere. \u00a0Take out is the best option. \u00a0Daily specials of lots o' meat for super cheap are the best reason to eat here.", 
      "Lil Porgy's is my favorite barbecue place in town. \u00a0It's also my favorite barbecue place overall, and I've been to Memphis and St. Louis. \u00a0I think some of the low-starred reviews here expected something different than what Lil Porgies is. \u00a0Lil Porgies is solid, delicious food for cheap. \u00a0If you want fancy sandwiches I recommend Black Dog instead - and the thirty+ minute wait. \u00a0If you want something dryer or Texas style, try Hickory River. \u00a0But if you want ribs, slathered in sauce, or barbecue chicken this is where you should be.I'm not a big fan of the sandwiches - they are kinda soggy - and I cannot begin to understand why you would order fried shrimp or fish sandwiches at a barbecue place. \u00a0The smell of slow cooking wood tells you what you should order. \u00a0That smell brightens my evenings as I drive home each night. \u00a0The ribs are awesome. \u00a0There is a range of quality - some days they are just Very Good, but other days they are Amazing. \u00a0I think it has to do with how long they sit on the shelf over the smoke - the longer, the better. \u00a0The barbecue chicken is also awesome - tender and very smoky. \u00a0I prefer the mixed sauce, which is both sweet and spicy, but the mild is more sweet. \u00a0They also sell the sauce along for cheap if, like me, you can't get enough of it.There are some seasonal offerings as well, like chili in a bread bowl or smoked turkey legs. \u00a0The chili was good and a reasonable price but I always come back to the pork ribs. \u00a0Meals come with big steak fries and white bread, both of which soak up the generous amounts of delicious sauce. \u00a0There are daily specials, but the best days are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday - beef ribs, pork ribs, and chicken ribs respectively. \u00a0The lemon shake-ups are sweet and delicious, too.I've eaten here many times and never been disappointed. \u00a0One of my stand-bys. \u00a0When I moved from Champaign to Urbana I was relived that \u00a0I was still within a couple minutes' drive of a Lil Porgies. \u00a0The building look a little sketchy but it's worth it to stop in.", 
      "I was going to eat half my order and save the rest for later but that didn't happen. I found myself eyeing my other diner's plates. The food is amazing. The chicken was tender and delicious. I tried each of the sauces and they were all delicious. Our favorite was the mixed (not hot, not mild). We had NO leftovers.", 
      "Best BBQ in the world. I am still trying to find a place that can remind me of Lil Porgy's in Chicago...What makes it for me is the sauce, quantity and prices.That sauce. Tart, sweet, tangy, spicy...so good. It's like A1 sauce in consistency. For those of you that are iffy about the sauce (because it seems like people have mixed reviews on it, get it on the side. That's what I usually do so it doesn't make the bread and fries soggy). I get the sauce on the side as well as some extra. Slap that on those juicy rib tips and I am good.Yes, the lemon shake-up and Tea are amazing also. They have huge sizes for the drinks. I ordered a large and that looked like it was extra large!I love that the fries are actually more like wedges instead of limp soft fries here at some of the more acclaimed places in Chicago.They had great daily specials at around $5 for a meal, but I would recommend the rib tips if it's your first time. They do the ribs and chicken best in my opinion. I haven't even tried any of the other things on the menu (aside from the sweet corn)...and I don't need to.Whenever I drive to the C-U area, I have to pick up some porgies. I MISS IT SO MUCH!Update: Make sure to get the Large sized rib tips. It makes a difference. If you get the small size, they'll sometimes give you some of the tougher ends or pieces they want to get rid of.", 
      "The sauce is what keeps bringing me back. \u00a0The delicious meats, while delicious, are an added bonus. The quality for the price kicks this up a notch to 5/5. \u00a0This is written all over the place.I just have to say that the experience from my past 10 years in Champaign-Urbana have taught me to NOT GO TO CHAMPAIGN'S Porgy's. \u00a0 This Porgy's in Urbana is consistent and generous especially when it comes to Rib Tips. \u00a0My friends and I religiously order rib-tips about once a month. \u00a0Champaign Porgy's often gives you around 40%+ BONE (not cartilage) in their Rib tips. This has been the case from the past 3 times I've been there this year. \u00a0Not only that, the Turkey legs tasted off and soapy, like they've been sitting in a wet drawer in a fridge. They were inedible.The Urbana Porgy's doesn't cheat you like this. \u00a0Urbana's Rib Tips consistently contain almost no bone (just juicy crunchy cartilage, which i enjoy), and their Turkey Legs were actually edible, if not delicious!I currently live close to Mattis (near Champaign Porgy's), but will always take the extra drive down to Urbana's Porgy's get my Porgy's fix. I've been scalded too many times to warrant purchasing from Champaign's Porgy's again.", 
      "Last night, while thinking about this place, I actually started to drool. I'm not kidding...then I vowed to write a review the next day.Go on sundays and get the half chicken special, comes with a HUGE drink and bread. Get the lemonade drink. Sometimes, I wish I could just buy their sauce (which I think you actually can) and just pour it on everything I eat. Their sauce is what makes their food delicious.", 
      "I'm always a fan of some good barbeque, and since moving to Champaign, I've been hearing tons of good things about this place. \u00a0Fairly certain I also saw it had won some \"Best Barbeque\" awards for the area. \u00a0My hopes were high, but after trying it, I was terribly let down.The barbeque this place serves reminds me of very average cafeteria style food. \u00a0I'll say I definitely thought the meat was very good.. \u00a0(I \u00a0have tried the chicken, pork, and beef) and it has a nice smoked taste to it. \u00a0Unfortunately, everything else that makes the sandwich fails. \u00a0The barbeque sauce, perhaps ultimately the most important ingredient, pretty much is what ruins the sandwich in my opinion. \u00a0Like a lot of other reviews have said, the sauce is unduly sweet, and extremely watery. \u00a0It almost tastes like drinking liquid sugar in some regards... The bread is not much better. \u00a0Sandwiches are literally served on tiny hoagie rolls like the generic ones you buy at the grocery store for $1. \u00a0Probably the most generic, cheap type of bread anyone can afford... Sides were also generally unimpressive. \u00a0Baked beans were nothing special, and I also had a potato salad side that seriously had almost NO taste to it. \u00a0It tasted like eating raw potatoes.All and all, definitely a huge let down for me, and very sub par barbeque and sides. \u00a0Really a surprise they keep winning the best Barbeque award for the CU area, but I guess there's no other competition? \u00a0Sad to say, but this was probably one of the worst barbeques I've ever had.", 
      "A little oily rib but excellent hot sauce! If u like hot, grab the x-hot, cool for the mouth.", 
      "\"Sunday Special\" = half a chicken, steak fries, two pieces of bread, and a HUGE drink for less than $6/person. I always leave full and satisfied.Get the \"Sunday Special\" with a lemon shake-up. Best combo ever! The BBQ sauce is so good. I always get the \"Mix\" sauce which is a combo of the mild and spicy sauce. So tasty and addicting! Get it on the side so you can dip your chicken into as much or as little as you want. I look forward to when I have kids and the time when we will head over to the University of Illinois for a college visit so I can take them to experience the delish, cheap, good eats that is Li'l Porgy's.", 
      "Among all the Southern-style BBQ places around campus, Li'l Porgy's is by far the most authentic, and flavorful. Frequent promotions made it hard *not* to go to Porgy's for at least some of our weekdays.Their southern sweet tea is wonderful.In comparison to the other Porgy's by the Original Pancake House; I've always thought this one to have a stronger smoky flavor.", 
      "I'm glad to write my first review ever about lil porgies!First I'd like to say that I've been eating here for over 4 years and for a place like Chambana, there's not that much to choose from. In my opinion, this place has one of the best smokie \"cooked on wood\" tastes in the area.I used to go a lot on Sundays for their 1/2 chicken special that included a 32oz lemonade shakeup, both which are delicious! All for under $5, this deal can't be beat. All their food has a good smoky flavor and you can order sauce in a few levels of spicyness, on the side or on your meat (usually mix is good). \u00a0Most of the items on their menu are pretty good and fresh if you go during the lunch/dinner hours, although the beef ribs might be a little dry at times.All their entrees comes with an order of fries and are served on a tray with paper and foil, basic but gets the job done. The place is quite small and dirty, but the aroma of the smoked wood and the style of food makes it seem more authentic.The quality of food might not be the best, but if you account for their fast service, killer sunday special, good sauce and CHEAP food, this place is definitely for you. In my opinion best bbq \"hole in the wall\" as of now in Chambana.", 
      "I've eaten the brisket of Texas and the vinegared pork of North Carolina. \u00a0I've savored the best meats in Memphis and met Kansas City's Arthur Bryant himself. Li'l Porgy's is the best barbeque I have ever had.", 
      "I went in to Li'l Porgy's with very high hopes. \u00a0It has been rated #1 BBQ in C-U for a number of years by several area publications... are these people on crack? \u00a0I went the other day with a few friends of mine. \u00a0I saw the shack and as we walked in, no frills, just a simple BBQ hole-in-the-wall. \u00a0But see I saw this as promising, because good BBQ doesn't come from a fancy place. \u00a0My staff was slightly hard to understand, but took my order. \u00a0There's no table service, but I didn't expect that. \u00a0I ordered a half-rack with a catfish sandwich and fries. \u00a0I was very disappointed. \u00a0That fish sandwich came out of someone's freezer. \u00a0Literally it was a fried fish patty in a bun. \u00a0TADA! \u00a0My ribs were less than pleasing. \u00a0The bones were everywhere; they gave me the crappiest slab of ribs. \u00a0The sauce tastes like apples & cinnamon (honestly, just not my thing for BBQ). \u00a0Fries come with every meal, you know like ten fries. \u00a0Haha and they had the audacity to put my fries underneath my ribs to smother them in the awful sauce which in the long run made them soggy.Hole-in-the-wall or not...don't need to come back to this place.", 
      "Let me start by saying I grew up eating here and have always felt it was a four plus star casual BBQ restaurant. Something has happened in the last 12 months. The current quality is really a disappointment. Please bring back the old Porgy's. My last three pork sandwiches were soggy and gross. Today I tried the beef sandwich special \u00a0and it was mainly sliced fat with overcooked dried beef. \u00a0You still make a mean lemon shake up and the fries are always good.", 
      "Sorry to be so harsh on this place, but all the reviews got us really pumped for awesome BBQ. Nada...We ordered sandwiches to go with a side a piece. The sides are super small and overpriced for the same taste you could buy at Schnucks. The bread was soggy from the watery sauce and on a hoagie! What? Toast=cool, \u00a0buns=okay, but a hoagie? Blek. The meat was tasty, but we could hardly get to it for all the sauce. If you want to try this place, order the sauce separate, because it made us nauseated for the rest of the afternoon.", 
      "Preface: I am a total BBQ snob--I know what I'm talking about when it comes to good smoked meat.If I was just evaluating the BBQ, I would give this place 5 stars. \u00a0That being said, the mediocre sides/atmosphere take one star away from my rating. When I come here, I get whatever is on the daily special (a menu item with a 10% off price). \u00a0Everything is great, as long as you come at the right time. \u00a0As usual with any BBQ place, you really need to come during lunch/dinner rush hours to have perfectly smoked meat (another 2-3 hours waiting in the smoker will easily dry out the meat). The meat is served with 2 pieces of plain Butternut-looking bread, and steak fries. You can substitute the steak fries for another side if you wish ( I usually pick the baked beans, which seems like they are from a can).The sauce here is delicious! You can pick from Mild, Mixed, Hot, or Xhot Even if you are scared of a little spice, I would at least get Mixed--the mild is way to sweet for my taste. \u00a0Watch out the the X-hot, it's very spicy stuff. \u00a0I am a spice head and usually get the Hot. \u00a0I can handle the X-hot but I reserve it for when I want to be sweating afterwards.Prices are great here! You would be hard pressed to find cheaper well-smoked 'cue anywhere else. \u00a0I really don't get everyone's obsession with Black Dog--I feel that they oversmoke their food and overcharge for the small amount that you get there.Bottom line: Real hickory-smoked barbecue for a great price. \u00a0Sides are mediocre, but sauce is great.", 
      "Dry and bland! I could cook better at home. I've tried both the pork and brisket.", 
      "Fast service but the overall quality was not impressive. The sauce tastes different then any other BBQ sauce I have ever tasted. Definitely not authentic Southern sauce. Decor is lacking greatly and the overall environment was quite dirty and messy. Disappointing for the high accolades given by friends.", 
      "The Sunday Special is a must - Half a Chicken. YUM. I love their extra hot sauce on the side. I once had it on top and nearly died of thirst if not for my Lemon Shake-Up. Sometimes, we take these to go and add extra Siracha to the mix. I think the chicken is usually quite moist, but I've been more 50/50 on the ribs. Sometimes they're dry, other times perfectly well done.", 
      "Horrible! Dry, flavorless chicken. \u00a0No meat on the ribs (though what little meat there was admittedly good). Soggy corn - as though it was sitting in water all day. Only two microcups of butter for four pieces of bread and three ears of corn. No personality at the counter and the napkins were held hostage by the lackluster employees.", 
      "Too much for me! I ordered a 1/3 slab beef ribs, and I can only eat half of them. There are about 6-8 ribs in one half plate, too much for me. And the hot source is not that spicy.", 
      "Every time I go to this one in Urbana, the service gets worse. This time an older man was working the counter,.When my brother from out of town asked him about the sauce, the man pointed to the menu sign.", 
      "It was my first time here and was told to go, so I did. \u00a0The food was yummy and when you ask for spicy BBQ sauce, it's spicy. \u00a0Just the way I like it. \u00a0The beef tips were worth the bite. The only thing that held me back from giving it five stars was the service. \u00a0The guy who took our order was ok, but when we went to go pick up our order, we asked again for the number that was called. \u00a0The guy didn't even answer us and just waved us to go on. \u00a0Ok, so we took our order. \u00a0We saw people get up and get refills so I went to go stand in line. \u00a0The guy just kept on ignoring me as I stood there for a few minutes trying to be polite. \u00a0He knew I was there standing there and after giving out a few orders, finally asked me what I wanted. \u00a0So I told him and he was rude and told me \"no!\". \u00a0Of course, I couldn't understand him so I asked him again for a refill and again, he abruptly said \"No!\" \u00a0I told him that I saw others get a free refill and he just walked away, letting me hanging.Wow, so if you don't care about good service and only want good BBQ, this is the place to be. \u00a0Don't expect a smile. \u00a0They treat you like you're imposing; nevertheless, enjoy the food.", 
      "Love this place, an old favorite of mine. Great sauce, meat has just the right amount of smokiness and who can resist a lemon shake up!", 
      "Aww yeah! \u00a0That smoky barbecue aroma used to permeate the windows of my car every time I drove by. \u00a0Awesome chicken, and the staff are funny and friendly. \u00a0No, it's not healthy, but it's good for the soul to indulge once a year. \u00a0Twice.", 
      "I just gave the Champaign Porgy's 2 stars.... \u00a0I always enjoy my large tips and Polish here. \u00a0That said, it would be 5 stars if they would give the Chicken the love that they use to back in the day.",

      "Gotta admit that the name of the place belies what's actually inside. When I hear the word \"Esquire,\" I think formal and gentlemen. What I got was scattered peanut shells all over the floor and a normal bar scene. Despite this, this place features some cool billiards. It's a great place to watch sports games and the prices are quite reasonable for the amount of food they serve. They have a condiment bar so you can put as much tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, and/or onions on your food. My burger and fried mushroom meal came out to be $8.49. And if you're feeling like a hipster, they have PBR pints for a dollar on Sunday.", 
      "There's something quite nice about this place. I've heard they're quite cheap with the drinks here, but I'm more a fan of the food. Every pizza I've had here has been really delicious. The ambiance is worth the visit as well, a traditional joint with pool tables on the side. But the bathrooms...avoid the bathrooms.", 
      "Great prices on drinks and food. The thin crust pizza is delicious. Good selection of draft beers.", 
      "Kind of underwhelming place overall. Average beer selection and limited food selection (their pizza is probably the best thing I've had). Feels like a 90's bar that hasn't done a great job of staying with the times.That being said, there is a nice energy throughout. Staff is great and service is prompt and friendly. The News Gazette has an Illini-based sports talk radio show there on mondays that is always a good time.", 
      "Coming from California, these are the cheapest drinks I've ever encountered! We called ahead of time to ask them to play the niners game, even though the bears / packers were the favored game of the day (and time). They had a TV set up all ready with the niners game when I got there.There are peanut shells all over the ground, which I find a little tacky and dangerous. The Pizza was pretty decent - thin crust. We ordered the Hawaiian although we substituted BBQ sauce for regular pizza tomato sauce.There are fun pool tables and other arcade games. A jukebox for your favorite tunes can be found near the bar, i think.This place seems to be a staple of downtown champaign.",

What the hell, it's a great dive bar. \u00a0I cant' even hate on it.The booths are big and comfy, the setting is as nonpretentious as it gets, and the peeps are chill as hell--and most likely you're not gonna run into many undergrads ;)", 
      "I came back here with a friend on a random Thursday night as we both felt it was too early to call it a night, but weren't looking for a venue with dance music blaring in our ears nor were we interested in having to shove through the crowds to get a drink.At Esquire, we managed to secure a pool table (only $6 an hour!!), got cheap drinks, and just had a relaxing low-key night. \u00a0Plus, I got to work on honing my pool-skills (or lack thereof =P).",

I'm not a grown up by any stretch of the imagination, but this place had no undergrads in sight. Plus, the deals! 18 Asian dumplings for around 5-6 dollars? Delicious black bean burger for about 5 bucks? Gin and tonic (my standard drink) for less than 4 bucks? What is not to love?Add in the great service, the nice sized televisions for sporting events, pool tables that I am dying to try, and quiet music so we can actually talk to each other and hear ourselves think, and I'm still kicking myself for only checking this place out now. Plus free peanuts! I LOVE FREE PEANUTS. Now, granted, this was a rather quiet Thursday, so we'll have to see what happens if/when it gets busy. But so far, all systems go.", 
      "I really don't understand how this place can be held in such high regard. \u00a0There isn't a particularly good drink selection, the food is terribly mediocre (the burgers are just terrible), and the bar itself has not a remarkable characteristic in sight.While all that is bad enough, I've always felt that the employees here are tremendously standoffish with anyone under 40, and this is the only place I've been to downtown where they'll chase your party down after you walk in the door. \u00a0With so many fantastic places in downtown Champaign, the only reason this one hasn't gone out of business has to be the location.", 
      "This will be a review down memory lane. \u00a0I grew up in this bar, much like Jackie H's review. \u00a0One of the bartenders was my little league baseball coach, then I played on the bars soft ball team. \u00a0Even though I have not lived in Chamaign for about 10 years, I can still find people I know, and bartenders that remember me.When I was little I would order kiddy cocktails from the bar, then get change to play on the only pinball machine. \u00a0Then stomp on all the peanut shells on the floor. \u00a0I have seen expansion many times. \u00a0Originally from one bar and a few booths, to a wrap around bar, then finally to the pool hall and extra bar area that you see now. \u00a0I have met U of I basketball coaches here, there are pictures of former Cubs players kissing my Mom (wait, what). \u00a0My parents originally met here. \u00a0It is safe to say my family has a mullti generational history here.Anyway, beyond the nostalgia, it is one of the best pubs to visit in the downtown area. \u00a0Just a great place to relax and have a few drinks. \u00a0Along with the evolution of the bar, so has the menu. \u00a0Now there is a mix of pub grub like burgers, fish sandwiches, etc. \u00a0Which I don't think are that great. \u00a0Though the various pizzas are very good. \u00a0As are the wings, which I am not typically a fan of. \u00a0Though these are baked, not fried and battered like most. \u00a0The Asian Dumplings are great as well. \u00a0The service can be hit or miss. \u00a0Depending on the time you come, and where you order. \u00a0Bar service is pretty good, but the waitresses can be a bit confused when trying to find you after you place the order. \u00a0Though they work hard, and always take care of anything that might be wrong.Drinks are pretty standard. \u00a0There are a handful of good micros on tap. \u00a0Usually something from Two Brothers or Dark Horse as the main micros available on tap. \u00a0A bit more extensive selection in bottles. \u00a0The rest is typical drinks for a neighborhood bar.Overall, not perfect. \u00a0Though the goods far out way the bad. \u00a0An institution in the downtown Champaign area, and a place I will always love.", 
      "What's with people all wearing flip flops all the time? I came here after dinner with a friend to shoot pool. But, as I was standing around the pool area, I realized that at all the tables, I was the only one not wearing flip flops.Ok, that aside, they have strongbow cider by the bottle and the pool tables are in decent (not excellent) shape.", 
      "Best bar in Champaign (IMHO) and the closest thing to \"Cheers\" in Champaign. Decent beer selection. Peanuts in the shell, eat them and throw the shells on the floor. 4 pool tables.Relaxed and laid back. Used to be a townie bar, then they expanded it and all types hang out there. Just your basic, no frills, hang out with your buddies, BAR.", 
      "You know you're going to have an interesting night when some random dude swipes some of your fries while you're playing pool. ha! Needless to say the first time I went to Esquire there was a bachelor party and it was hilarious to watch the crazy activities. The selection of booze is fine, there is even a batch of peanuts to grab and munch on while you're hanging out. I tried their fried broccoli recently, it's soooo addicting. The place can be a tad messy, obviously because of the peanuts, and it definitely has a mix of townies and college kids, but it's a pretty fun place to go to for a hang out with friends.", 
      "Esquire is a gym-class all star: it performs reasonably well in most areas, and can be counted on not to kick the ball into its own goal, but isn't going to catch the eye of any out-of-town talent scouts or date cheerleaders. Its journeyman efforts will win friends and a few high fives, but it is not the flashy varsity letterman. Food here is just fine, and very reasonably priced. I have been disappointed with the size of their appetizers once or twice, but their entrees are a solid value, cooked dependably to be exactly what you expect in pub grub. Prices are very good for downtown Champaign, but they lack the booze selection of a Radio Maria or Blind Pig. The gross looking jar on the bar is infused vodka.Service is always friendly, and fastest at the bar. If you sit at their pretty awesome outside tables, the trade off is that you're gonna get ignored. You can order lunch ahead and pick up 15 minutes later. The free peanuts are priceless, as are the friendly patrons who are more likely than other crowds in town to strike up a convo with you. All this sounds pretty complimentary, but the fact is that this place is not stand-out awesome in any particular way. If you want to take your friends from Chicago to visit 4 places in downtown Champaign that are all different from each other, to give them an idea of what the \"new\" Champaign has to offer, you aren't going to stop at Esquire. Of course, that's just fine with me. I'll at the end of the bar eating peanuts and saying to some dude I just met holy shit the White Sox sure are Cubbing it hard this September.", 
      "I'm liking this spot! \u00a0Not quite a dive; you can eat free peanuts and toss shells on the floor, so almost. \u00a0Most reasonable damn drink prices in town.Cheap good noms: black bean burger, daily soups, fried brocco, and best of all asian dumplings.Larger inside than seems it'd be- there are many pool tables, 2 bars, lots of booths. \u00a0Music low enough to hold conversation if so inclined. \u00a0Not a shit-ton of kids (undergrads) around to annoy.Good spot to get your grown-folks drink on. \u00a0Did I mention the most reasonable drink prices around? \u00a0Three pints of PBR under 5 bucks for the win!", 
      "New to town, I got in with a group of Masters students that meet up here every Friday, and so far, this place is awesome. \u00a0Lots of room outside and in, cheap drinks and good food at a good price. \u00a0Its great to have veggie food at a bar that isn't cheese and/or deep fried! \u00a0The portobello mushroom sandwich is delicious.The staff is always available to take more orders, don't mind splitting checks for groups, and there is a wide selection of drinks available.", 
      "First off let me say that I am definitely a city girl so restaurants like Esquire are not really my type. I have dietary restrictions and I need to be picky. I came here with my mom and sister to grab some food on Sunday. It seemed to be the only place open. I ordered the portabella mushroom sandwich (super bland), my sister got the chicken salad (she said it was pretty good), and my mom ordered the salmon.Overall the food was nothing special to me however coming from the city to this little suburb area the price for the food was pretty amazing. The salmon only cost $7 and it was a fairly big portion. The servers were nice but the atmosphere was too load. I wont be back here but that mostly has to do with the lack of food options.", 
      "Synopsis: This place is a dive which alot of people find happen to find sentimentally appealing. ..........MMM OK- it's actually more of a watering hole. You know, an acceptable environment within which to get your drank on. It's just impersonal enough that townies, transplants, and recent grads can tolerate one another- and low enough on the ego scale that they may let their guard down enough to interact with one another for a moment.The food and the men's bathroom share some compelling similarities- they are both occasionally necessary, routinely \"less-than-fresh\", and exist in the same realm between offensive and forgettable.", 
      "Atmosphere is fun and a great place to come out and shoot pool with friends but I can't stand coming here for lunch. I don't know why I bothered trying a second time. So my main complaint about the lunch dining experience is sanitation. I ordered the burger the first time and a hot dog the second. I guess some people don't mind having a communal condiments station but I have a problem with this. The fresh produce like pickles, onions, and lettuce are not refrigerated at all at the communal condiments station. I mean at least puts some cold ice under the box of pickles, lettuce, and onions at least! The ketchup bottle and mustard container all looked like it was ready for the dump. The tips were hardened and crustified and it just looked out of date because no one bothered to keep em clean. Stickyness galore. Wash your hands if you still decide to go. Anyway, minus food but fun joint. Proceed with caution cuz after a few beers you might just make a drunk order of food and realize you got yourself into a bigger mess then you had planned.", 
      "I go to Esquire a fair amount, but mostly for the pineapple tequila margaritas. They're to die for, and often the only thing I order here. Otherwise, the spirits and beer selections are okay. It's about on par with the rest of the downtown bars (similar to Jupiters, for instance). The pool space is nice and open as well. I'm not a huge fan of the aesthetic (my inner OCD hates the peanut shell on the floor schtick) but it's a pretty good bar.The food, on the other hand, has been consistently underwhelming. I haven't tried the pizza yet, but that's because I've been unimpressed by the other stuff I have tried. The appetizers tend to be greasy, and the chicken fingers were weak. Plus food normally takes forever to come out of the oven.In short, come for the booze, but eat beforehand.", 
      "I don't remember my first visit to the Esquire. I suspect I'm not alone, but my reasons probably differ. See, I was less than a year old at the time, and I likely wasn't into doing much more than staring out the window at the buses or blinking up at the moving Hamm's sign.Luckily for me, I have been to Esquire many more times since. You could say I grew up throwing peanut shells on the floor and stomping on them. (For the record, I still throw the shells on the floor, but I no longer do the accompanying dance--that stopped being cute around age eight.) Before my family moved away from Champaign, this was the number one place we would take out of town relatives visiting. Even as objectively yummier, cooler places opened up around town, Aunt So-and-so and Uncle Whatshisface would always demand to be taken back to Esquire, and we were always happy to oblige. It's a comfortable, unpretentious bar, and that's what you needs sometimes.It's all about the ambiance, really. There are better burgers in town, but at Esquire it's the whole package that keeps me coming back. That and those peanuts. For real.", 
      "It used to be a towny bar but I think more recently there are younger people who frequent. \u00a0It's not trendy.. it's more laid back. \u00a0They do make good drinks and you get free peanuts. \u00a0When I say drinks.. I mean things like rum and coke. \u00a0If you ask for a mojito or margherita..those can be disasters. \u00a0The service is also excellent.The reason why I keep going back.. their fried broccoli (even if you don't like broccoli) or fried dumplings (even if you're Asian). \u00a0I go back all the time because of that. \u00a0The other stuff is just average in my opinion.", 
      "I go to this bar every single time I'm in Champaign. They have an actual jukebox that's loaded with good stuff, you can eat peanuts and throw the shells on the floor, they have pool tables, and lets not forget, the CONTUSIONS. They're just shots of pineapple infused tequila and even my friends who hate tequila seem to love them.I also really like this bar because they have some good bar food (lots of fried stuff) and they serve fried food pretty late. This place is also big, so it can feel busy without being shoulder-to-shoulder like some bars. It's just an all around nice place for a chill night or a party with a big group. Probably one of my favorite bars in Champaign. Just make sure you have your ID because they WILL card you!UPDATE: The jukebox is now gone. I am not happy.", 
      "After a stressful day of test taking, my friend and I just wanted to relax, eat, and it was a beautiful day so we preferred somewhere outside. \u00a0She had been to Esquire before and said the burgers were good. \u00a0I really like the place. \u00a0I had the chicken tender sandwich with fries, and it was FABULOUS. \u00a0Everything a fried chicken finger sandwich could be. \u00a0At first it was delivered to the table empty, just a bun and chicken fingers. \u00a0But then I was told of the \"Fixin's Table\" where I got to add my own lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and a sauce(s) of my choosing. I enjoyed sitting outside and watching the people walk by. \u00a0And when my other friend showed up with her dogs, they didn't mind at all. \u00a0And she loved that they had Fat Tire on tap.Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. \u00a0The only problem with sitting outside is that you do not get to throw your peanut shells on the floor- you have to bring a bowl outside for the shells... ah well... \u00a0On those cold winter nights I can throw my shells on the floor inside.", 
      "This place is vastly different from any of the other restaurants downtown because its atmosphere is neither pretentious nor dumpy. \u00a0It somehow manages to straddle the line in such a way that nobody really seems to feel out of place there. \u00a0The burgers are some of the best in Champaign. \u00a0They have a good char-grilled taste to them that so many other, more pretentious, places lack. \u00a0There are a large number of sides to select from, including fried mushrooms, onion rings, french fries, potato chips (which, sadly, just come from a bag), fried broccoli, and Asian dumplings (which my friends tell me are fantastic). \u00a0I've had the polish sausage once, and it was passable, but nothing special. \u00a0The pizza is good and comes in a number of varieties.The one complaint I have is that the service can be especially hit-and-miss. \u00a0There have been times I've been served wonderfully, and there have been times I've been ignored for a half-hour just to refill my drink.Overall, Esquire is a down-to-earth place with good prices and good food.", 
      "I love this place so much... \u00a0It's my favorite bar in town.The grilled cheese and fried broccoli is where it's AT, and the drinks are inexpensive. \u00a0It can be quiet enough to have lots of talking with friends, loud enough to chill by yourself and have some food.One drawback is it's hard to find seating on weekends, but with two rooms and two bars, it just takes a bit of time but not too long, and that happens with any bar in downtown on the weekend.", 
      "My number 1 \"go-to\" place. \u00a0Great food, great drinks, and a great place to just hang out. \u00a0The \"Cheers\" of Champaign!Not too long after moving here I stopped in for lunch one day, and that had me hooked. \u00a0Lots of friendly regulars hanging out at the bar! And unlike many bars, the kitchen is open until closing, great for a late night snack or late meal.", 
      "Ruthie AW Harper (unregistered) says:LadyLuvThe Place Where Everyone Feels @ Home...You get the complete package; Good Food, Good Drinks, Friendly Servers and a welcoming atmosphere.", 
      "This is the first bar I visited when I moved here five years ago. It's also the place I had my first legal drink, the place I arranged my first (extremely underwhelming) one-night stand, the place I had my first post-breakup talk ... the list goes on and on. In short, the Esquire is a place of firsts for me, and for that reason it holds an unimpeachable place in my heart.It's a good place, even taking none of the above into account. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly, the drinks are stiff, the food is tasty, the jukebox kicks much ass (except on one night a few years back when some doucherocket fed about a million dollars into the machine and played Pogues records all night, but I am willing to let bygones be bygones). There's a nice array of seating options: small tables, mid-size tables, large booths, and the bar itself, which is the best place to sit if you want super-fast service and a good vantage point for eavesdropping and people-watching. There are also some tables outside, which are nice places to park your ass if you're a smoker or like keeping an eye on the goings-on along Walnut. The outdoors is heated during chilly weather, and although it doesn't too a ton of good in the dead of winter, it's lovely on brisk autumn nights.The people who frequent this place are an interesting mix. Some townies, some students, some regulars, some noobs. You're just as likely to see a gaggle of hipsters looking vaguely out of place as you are to see a group of middle-aged business types in dad jeans. Every once in a while some truly fresh and interesting personalities will be present, such as a trio of cackling cougars sipping pineapple margaritas and flirting with any male under the age of 26, or two sharply-dressed men having a snappy but ultimately friendly conversation you ache to be a part of, or a crusty old man with a walrus mustache who will pound your table with a hammy fist and yell something that sounds friendly but is completely unintelligible. Oh, and every once in a while Tim Lash of Hum fame will be hanging around, which I think we can all agree is pretty delightful. (I do not advocate drunkenly pestering him, of course, but if you do want to say hi be assured that he's about the nicest dude on earth and will receive your attention with much grace and warmth.)One of the best, most endearing things about this bar is its all-around friendliness. I often go here by myself in the evening with whatever book I'm currently reading, fold myself into a corner, and order a few beers. Not once has any patron or staff member given me grief over this, and for that I am truly grateful. Yes, the linoleum is hideous and yes, the bathrooms are a little iffy, but all the bartenders remember my name, and that's something that can't be beat.", 
      "you know you're in a sweet bar when you spend more money on the jukebox than you do on drinks. esquire has one of the best jukeboxes i've ever come across, and over the years i have probably played every song at least twice!great divey bar. students, regulars, pool sharks. peanut shells on the floor. pinball machine, old school table bowling, pool tables, and plenty of booths and tables to relax in.they make their own pineapple infused tequila- get some in a margarita and you won't be disappointed! also excellent bar food- dumplings and fried broccoli are some of my drunk favorites.the only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the pool is a bit pricey. $9 for 2 hours? lame.", 
      "Mostly great venue. \u00a0Beer selection is good. \u00a0Easy to get to. \u00a0Food is ok. \u00a0Salmon is awesome. \u00a0 Just a few times there was an issue with either too much noise from the TV or jukebox so I couldn't hear the person next to me.", 
      "Location is good, drinks are usually on the strong side...HOWEVER, the rude service you can expect to receive here, far outweigh the positives. \u00a0Every single visit to the esquire, I received unfriendly, uninviting service. \u00a0The crowd in this place is 40+ and unless you fall into this category, the staff will make you feel very unwelcome. \u00a0Every trip downtown, I want to give esquire another chance, and every time I'm disappointed.", 
      "Love this place. I eat here at least 4 times a week. It has it's own charm and staff are all friendly once you get to know them.", 
      "I stopped into Esquire Lounge for a couple hours in the evening while waiting for the 7:59 PM Amtrak train back to Chicago. This place is right across the street from the station. I sat by myself at the bar, but there were plenty of others riding solo as well. It was THAT kind of place - where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows. Actually, it was much more than that - this place seems to have a little bit of everything. There are pool tables in the back, so you can get that sort of crowd. There are larger tables as well, so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away. There are a good amount of TV's, so there were some people watching the evening college football games. There are decent sized booths, so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops. And there's a jukebox, so some people are silently rocking out to the classics. And perhaps best of all, there were plenty of townies around for some great people watching. At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem. Although he didn't get the words right, I gave him an A+ for effort. The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay. It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends, and even the students are cool with the townies.The beer selection was surprisingly good. There were a lot of good import options available, although I stuck with $2.25 Bud Light drafts. Remember, I was taking the Amtrak home, so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend.... They have $1.50 PBR drafts too, which is what the locals stuck to. The food was pretty good as well. I had a simple cheeseburger and fries. Although not my favorite burger/fries combo, it was definitely worth the $4.50 I paid. The \"fixin's table\" they have is nothing more than onions, pickles, and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces - Nothing special there. But there was something cool about being able to put that stuff on yourself, I guess.The charm of this place lies in the characters that visit, and for that alone, I am giving a 5 star rating. The cheap food and beer is an added bonus. And I almost forgot, free peanuts! If I return to Champaign any time soon, I will definitely be back to this place.", 
      "My last visit to Champaign treated me to some wonderful places to spend some quality time with friends. Murphy's Pub, The Blind Pig, and others. I would not put Esquire on that list.The decor is uninteresting at best. There is no personality. It's designed to appeal to a crowd that just wants a nice bright place to hang out and drink.Not being a drinker, I can't rate the Esquire on that, but I can rate them on the food, and the food is so forgettable, I forgot to review it. Our group had a couple of burgers, some wings, and a chicken sandwich. I was told the burgers were good. The chicken must be avoided at all costs.The sandwich is one of those strange creations that takes chicken strips and puts them on a bun. I'm not entirely sure why, as this makes an awkward eating experience. The strips were nearly tasteless. Thank goodness for mayonaise. My wife had the wings. After one or two, she was trying to figure out why they didn't seem right. I was going to eat them, but I couldn't, and I LOVE wings. These things had enough salt to turn Lake Michigan into a salt lake. They were awful. \u00a0I would not go back at all. I'll eat diner food, fast food, and other kinds of food, but not Esquire Food. Meh.", 
      "This place is the most laid-back, chill, bar that I have ever been to. The people here are mostly an older crowd, but they make you feel right at home. I like this place because their burgers are cheap and you can get the side stuff (lettuce, tomato, etc.) yourself at a different table and can therefore get allllll the pickles that your heart desires. Not to mention, unlimited peanuts!", 
      "I only went there once but I really liked it. \u00a0I have never been to a place where it felt so comfortable. \u00a0I got a burger which was pretty good and reasonably priced. \u00a0They have free peanuts and the atmosphere is great. \u00a0I sat outside and it was just a really comfortable place to be. \u00a0Everyone there was friendly and just relaxing. \u00a0Service and atmosphere is the best part of the place.", 
      "Staff are great, though service can be slow if the place is very busy, which is understandable because the food is amazing. I tried the steak garden salad and the meat was cooked to perfection. Most restaurants serve bland salads or poor cuts of red meat, but not Esquire!", 
      "Esquire pretty much kicks ass. I first discovered it while I was working for the city across the street and would come over for lunch quite a bit to get a steak sandwich while I was in the process of packing on the pounds. \u00a0I've since lost weight and now I eat the black bean veggie burger (absolutely delicious). \u00a0Esquire has grown and changed (a bit) over the years to accomodate the changes in downtown Champaign, but it still retains much of its original character. \u00a0I think it and the Brass Rail are the only two places left where you can really hang with the hardcore downtown alcoholics. \u00a0I mean HARDCORE! \u00a0Esquire is awesome!", 
      "We were looking for a place to eat and grab a beer with little kids after a long drive. We were also looking for something with a \"college\" feel considering its a college town and we are about 10 years out of college. Nostalgia gets me every time. This place had a much older crowd (on a Monday)...think 45 year old regulars, but what do you expect on a Monday night? The draft beer selection was ok. They have one Bell's, Guiness and Harp on tap, but that's as \"crafty\" as it gets at the front bar (the back bar was closed and may have had more available). The food was only OK. We got a small personal pizza and a steak sandwich. Neither one was that great. The staff was super friendly and GREAT with the kids. The price was also right."

      "Ok I am biased.A C-U native, I sat at The Courier for the first time as a baby in one of their wooden highchairs. This place is more than a restaurant to me. But, try their black bean burgers (!), expansive salad bar, or one of their hand-dipped milkshakes. Or meet your friends for breakfast/brunch. Doubtful you'll regret it. This place is full of history, memories and home.", 
      "This place is interesting - its too fancy and historical to really be called a diner (in the normal sense). I came here for the first time, being hosted by a long time town resident.You walk in to an absolute historical feel with historical reads and artifacts everywhere and a good sense of that small town charm.My favorite items were the hand dipped Milk Shakes - more than just the origianals, but all sorts of mid-westerny cream soda flavors. I ordered Peanut flavored.Everything from the soups to the sandwitchs were hearty and delicious and warmed you up (especially in this frigid weather) for my next mid western adventure...", 
      "What a lovely place to grab a leisurely, hearty breakfast or brunch. While yes the place is technically a diner, it's really the only one I've ever seen that could be said to offer some historical interest as well; as the back of the menu describes in detail, the place used to be the home of the Courier Newspaper. Much of the decor hanging on the walls has some historical significance, which was so cool! Perfect place to bring an out-of-towner.The food was really delicious. I ordered a Spanish omelette, which was HUGE and came with potatoes and a choice of homemade bread (I chose sourdough bread). The potatoes came diced, and were fried slightly soft--almost like very very tender McDonalds hashbrowns. Not my preferred breakfast potato style, but I'll take it!! The omelette was my favorite part--stuffed with fresh jalapenos, onions, chorizo, and Chihuaha cheese. And so cheap, too! 8-ish bucks for a very generous meal.But the best part of the meal: the truly great service (particularly in contrast to the brunch experience I had had just the day before elsewhere, in Champaign). I don't remember her name, but our waitress just beamed amiable Midwest charm, and was very competent about getting us refills and keeping us apprised of the status of our dishes when there was a bit of a wait to get our food. My friend who brought us to this place has stories of how this same waitress would bring her hot tea with lemon when she was feeling ill.I believe it. And I'd gladly come back next time.", 
      "Ah, the memories of entering the Courier Cafe, way back in my last year in Urbana, when a friend had a flat down the street. It was a splurge for me then, though I'm sure that the prices were as low as they are today. Now, it was time to bring my niece here, the night before she registered for her classes and we took a tour of my old abode, Allen Hall, which is now her casa for the next year. \u00a0And I guess it was our lucky day: I tried the coin-op crane and scooped up a prize, she got to chew the gummy fruits of my lucky labor. I had the quesadilla, which was large and tasty. Don't expect it to have the authenticity of M\u00e9xico; I wouldn't expect it to in a place so resplendent in Americana. But the American adaptation was a treat.Near a campus that has changed from mom & pop restaurants, it's very much worth the trek to get some home-style cooking in a historic, small business.", 
      "The Courier Cafe offers a great old-time diner feel. My favorite thing about this place, and the main reason I go, is the pay-by-weight salad bar. It's a great way to get a cheap, fast, and filling lunch. The cookies are also fantastic however, anything with that much butter usually does :)", 
      "A great place to grab breakfast. I've had lunch there too, but their breakfast is the best in downtown Urbana. I would recommend them to anyone as they have something for everyone.", 
      "I come to champagne all the time and this is my 2nd time here. Homemade bread, friendly staff, great coffee ! Can't ask for much more!! And my ham tastes like it's been made over an open fire, delicious", 
      "Visited this place on my last day in Champaign after 5 years ironically although everyone says you should go here at least once. Went with a few friends for lunch and this cafe has a nice old school vibe to it and even has a really old cash register. I opted to keep it simple and try the Courier Burger. A really simple burger, but it was delicious and the potato wedges were hot and plentiful. My friends loved their meal options including the black bean soup and salad. Definitely would recommend this place and I wish I could have tried their breakfast options here.", 
      "We just tried Courier Cafe today for lunch and it was great! I had the Banker Burger and my boyfriend had a beef quesadilla - both were exceptional, homemade quality. Their potato salad is killer! Our waitress and hostess were also very pleasant. We will definitely be back! :)", 
      "I went to the Courier Cafe for a late dinner, and I left satisfied. Its more expensive than most restaurants in campustown, but the food is worth it. I ordered a burger, and it was very filling. All my friends were pleasantly surprised too. My vegetarian friends tell me that the vegetarian selection is good as well. I'd recommend getting one of their hand dipped shakes. You may get sticker shock upon first seeing the price, but it is worth the money.", 
      "I usually do not frequent diners, but my parents had picked this place and they were paying so I said it can't be that bad (and it wasn't!).We decided to have an early dinner around 4pm and were seated immediately, but later on when we were finished around 5, there was over a 10 minute wait, even on Labor day. Inside was kind of small, old, rustic/historic looking, but still kinda cute. We were initially seated in the back room by the salad bar, but opted for a table change since my folks are unusually picky about the location of their table. \u00a02 family members began with a trip to the salad bar, which had a variety of everything and is priced by weight, including some remarkably good cold pasta salad in kind of a red cream sauce. My mother had the cream of (I can't remember) soup, which had potatoes and peppers in it, which she said was pretty good. My father enjoyed his turkey club, which looked really good and was pretty large in size. Also, my Mom said her reuben was decent as well. I ordered a build-your-own 1/2 pound burger which was on special that day for only $6, which was quite the meal deal. The options for building a burger were over 30, and I elected a strange, (but really tasty) combination of chiuahah (spell check?) cheese, a fried egg, pico de gallo and black beans, almost going for a southwestern style thing. This monstrosity of a sandwich was delicious, and was even better when I put on the included lettuce, tomato and onions. I also had a side of cole slaw, which was surprisingly yummy as well. My brother said he liked the buffalo chicken wrap, but wished the sauce was on the inside so he could eat it like an actual wrap and not have to cut it up with silverware. Other than that, no complaints on the food. Unfortunately, we did not try any of the deserts or baked goods on display, which looked fantastic, even some old-fashioned milkshakes served in the silver glasses as well as in-house cookies and cakes.Our server was friendly and polite. It seemed that they were a little understaffed on the holiday, so our check came out a bit slow, but that would be my only minor gripe with our dining experience. Now that I go to school in the area, I will definitely have to come back for breakfast and the desert items. The Courier surprised me as a fairly inexpensive diner-style place with in-house baked goods and a variety of tasty food. If only it were located closer to campus, perhaps on Green street, that would be the ideal location!Either way, we had a very pleasurable experience at the Courier and I'll be back.", 
      "Here on Yelp it says the place takes reservations. When my friend called a day ahead, she was informed that she would have to reserve a table the day we would sit down for brunch. When she called again the following morning, her name was added to a list as opposed to having a table reserved; no distinction over the phone the second time was made regarding a reservation vs name holding; we waited about an hour after we were first told it would be a 30-40 minute wait for a table. We came during UIUC's Moms weekend so I'm giving the benefit of the doubt, not deducting a star, but under pressure this place seems frazzled: only one hostess, few waiters, and sides of juice or hash browns that only appeared upon politely reminding a passing staff member.As a vegan I decided on a light and simple breakfast, substituting the egg for tofu that had turmeric thrown on seemingly for color but not taste. Perhaps next time, lunch on a quiet weekend will fare better. I'm not giving up on Courier Caf\u00e9 just yet.",

      "This is a diner; if you expect more, also expect to be disappointed. Spanish chorizo omelette was light and flavorful but drowned in terrible tostidos salsa. Sourdough bread has really good flavor but had some fake butter slop on it that tasted like buttered popcorn jelly bellies. Biscuits and chunky sausage gravy were very good.Very friendly service from my experience.Not really a destination... Perhaps a good motto for c-u in general?", 
      "This week I stopped into the Courier Cafe for the first time. \u00a0We were grabbing a late lunch, which was probably a mistake. \u00a0I ignored my intuition that this place is probably only suited for breakfasts. \u00a0There were limited items on the menu that were healthy. \u00a0I ordered the soup and sandwich combo. \u00a0I had black bean soup, which was pretty tasteless, and the chicken salad sandwich, which was unremarkable and doused in too much mayo.The worst part is my dining companion got the special, a chicken fajita bowl. \u00a0Now, let's grant that you probably shouldn't expect excellent Tex Mex in a joint with antiques and an Americana vibe. \u00a0But, he took the plunge. \u00a0He sincerely regrets this, as he was rendered useless after eating the bland \"fajita bowl\", which was more like chicken salad with jarred salsa in a taco bowl. \u00a0By useless, I mean he must have gotten an extreme case of food poisoning because he spent the entire remainder of the day making multiple trips to the men's room.After an experience with the food here that left us sick, I wouldn't come back. \u00a0There are much better places to grab a bite in downtown Urbana.", 
      "I've only had breakfast here. I am giving them four stars for two main reasons: the best biscuits and sausage gravy in town and a stellar breakfast burrito. In fact, I won't order B&G anywhere else. I highly recommend the biscuits and gravy with extra sausage and an egg on top. That said, the gravy has more sausage than any other in town. It is also made in-house (one of the servers informed me of this). I also get their Cha-Cha-Churritos sometimes. Simply put, this is one of the best places in town for breakfast.", 
      "Their cheese quesadilla is to die for! Yumm, can't wait to go back again.Great atmosphere and service", 
      "Our whole family loves Courier Cafe. We've been coming here for 14 years and have never had a bad meal.Breakfast? Outstanding. Great eggs, pancakes and out of this world jam.Lunch? Burgers that fill you up, soup that makes me want to come back.Dinner? Great specials, comfort meals that say relax, you're at home.Late night snacks? You bet. Ice cream and pie that satisfy whether the Illini have won or not.Friendly service, honest ingredients all add up to a fabulous restaurant. But don't come here, it's hard enough to get a table now.", 
      "This was my second time at the cafe and it does not disappoint! They have the best milkshake in the Champaign Urbana area! I ordered the peanut butter banana milkshake and it was the perfect amount of consistency! Some places either make their milkshakes too thick or too watery, but courier cafe's milkshake is perfection in my mouth! My friends and I also ordered the dipper. It was potato skin with bacon, sour cream, cheese, and green onions. I didn't expect it to be so delicious. No doubt, when I visit again, my combo is going to be a milkshake with the dipper. YUM!", 
      "Stumbled across this place thinking that it was just a coffee shop and was even more pleasantly surprised that it was more of a diner. Everything was homemade and delicious. We shared walnut banana pancakes, biscuits with sausage gravy, and eggs w/hash browns. \u00a0Everything was stellar! The pancakes were probably the best I've ever had! Would definitely come back here if I were in the area (though, I probably won't be, since I was just in town for a wedding). Man, I wish there was a place like this near me!", 
      "3 Things stand out to me at Courier Cafe:Ribeye Sandwich- Amazingly delicious / juicy ribeye sandwich, must recommendMake your own Burger- My friend decided to make is own burger, ordered bacon, and bacon, and extra bacon. He got 6 things of bacon for the price of \"make your own burger\"Shakes- Very solid shakes, extremely delicious but didn't seem too sugary", 
      "Cheap and good. I usually go for one of the burgers but everything I've had off the menu has been good.", 
      "The decor was old fashioned and dirty feeling. Even some fresh painted walls would help the overall feel. We wanted to eat lunch but arrived at 1130 and had to order breakfast. \u00a0I ordered the Spanish Omelette, my husband ordered the Courier Breakfast and our kids got pancakes. None of us really enjoyed our meals. Both my husband and my glasses had cracks in them and were leaking all over the table. We would not return.", 
      "On man. BEST. PANCAKES. EVER. This has turned into a Sunday morning tradition. The service has always been really great (with one exception, but maybe he was having an off day). Everyone is usually really friendly and attentive. The Cake and Egger is my breakfast choice but I bet it's all good. I've only eaten lunch here once. I got the salad bar and the black bean burger. The black bean burger while not terrible, just wasn't for me. It was really bloated and mushy which made it difficult to eat. I had to just eat it with a fork. I'm used to something a little more dense and solid like a burger would be. The salad bar was delicious. REALLY great selection and everything was fresh. My one complaint would be that I'm 5 ft 6in, which is not really that short, and it was really difficult to reach toppings and their \"sneeze guard/window\" apparatus is really awkward. But it's worth the hassle. You go up and get your salad, they weigh it and you give the ticket to the sever. I got a very large salad for about $5. \u00a0Love this place. Great ambience, great food.", 
      "This place definitely exudes an antique-hipster aura. I wouldn't be surprised if the people working here were hipsters themselves. I absolutely love the style of the menu. I ordered a Dagwood which is a 3 layer sandwich that includes ham, roast beef, two cheeses, pickles, tomato, lettuce, secret sauce, cucumbers, and onions. Though the waitress got our order wrong (two of us didn't want onions on our items), the food was still magnificent. Half of the Dagwood sandwich was enough to make me feel satisfied. We ordered the brownie special. Indeed, that brownie now has a special place in my heart. The brownie special can be enjoyed by two-three people. It is a brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, whip cream, and a side of chocolate syrup. I gotta say that the brownie itself inundated my senses with a resplendent sweet flavor.", 
      "By far the best place for breakfast in CU, and their coffee is always top notch. I've never had any qualms with the service, and never waited for over 5 minutes for a seat. Everyone's super friendly and I always leave in a great mood.", 
      "Good food. \u00a0Cool, historic building and decor. \u00a0I had a BLT (my standard fare when traveling) and the bacon was outstanding. \u00a0It was busy the day we were here. Lots of townies, I could tell, so I know this place is a staple of Champaign. For me, this is a 'can't miss' diner.", 
      "Excellent place for breakfast and dinner. Absolutely love their coffee. They have always been prompt with their service despite how busy they get. Recommendations: any omelette, paperboy breakfast, and their burgers. Salad bar is also a great choice for lunch. Highly recommend all of their soups too!", 
      "I'd pass if I were you.This 4-star bullshit is a reflection of Urbana's high tolerance for mediocrity.The sandwiches look like something a kindergartener would get at a daycare center with a side of fruit cocktail. Wonderbread with an anorexic serving of meat and a pickle spear for $8 or more.We had to get up and walk around to find an employee who would take our money. The couple next to us got up and left because nobody would take their order.Inexcusably bad service, inexplicably bad food. Come on, Urbana, for once, accept the fact that some businesses are meant to die. In case you don't get out much, the Courier Cafe is terrible. They are operating as if they have no competition.Suffering through a shit sandwich and bad service is a stupid way to supporting local business. Unless you're into self-punishment and leather and... you know, in that case, join the priesthood.", 
      "I've always gone for breakfast and it's usually pretty good. It's hard to find a good breakfast place in C-U! A few days ago, I went with my friend and our two kids (baby and a 2 year old). I got there and stood at the top of the steps for, no joke, 10 minutes before the host even acknowledged me. But they were swamped and I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I've worked in food service. When he finally asked if I \"needed something,\" I was confused. The sign clearly says, \"Please wait to be seated.\" I told him I was waiting for a table, and he said, \"Oh, there's one down there,\" and pointed towards the kitchen. My friend and I took our seats, and the host brought a high chair. Someone brought us water, and another 10 minutes later, our frazzled, odd server came to our table. She asked if we were ready to order, and we looked down and said, \"Well.... we never got any menus....\" She came back with the menus, blamed it on someone else, and we ordered our food. Every time she came to the table, she had some sort of snide comment -- maybe she was just having a bad day or that's her personality, but it was annoying. It would have helped if she would have ever brought us refills, checked to be sure we liked our food, asked if we needed anything else. At the end of the meal, she said, \"Gosh your table is so quiet,\" which we both laughed at. How would she know? She never stopped by!The food, however, was fine. I ordered a Dagwood Sandwich (after the hostess said, \"Well, that's a LOT of food,\" and I politely responded, \"OK and I'll also have a side of fries.\") I got the sandwich with just mustard, no secret sauce or mayo, and it's was pretty good (it was a tall sandwich). I shared the sandwich and fries with my 2 year old. We had a few fries left over, to give you an idea of how much food it ended up being.The bill was about $10 -- on the high end for lunch, but considering it was a large lunch, it seems pretty reasonable.Lunch was fine, but I think I will stick with breakfast at the Courier. They seem too overwhelmed at lunch!", 
      "We have been coming into the Courier Cafe for years, \u00a0and despite the very tasty \"home-cooked\" feel the meals at Courier Cafe have, \u00a0service has steadily deteriorated. It has never been so bad. The only reason why we placed 2 stars is because of the food.-(Money-saving Mystery Butter blend) On numerous occasions when we dined here, we had a very hard time getting an order in. When ordering a plate, the waitress was cold and stern. We asked her to bring plain butter rather than their money-saving \"mystery butter blend\", and she was making a face and saying \"Oh I'm not sure I can do that\", despite the fact that they have pure butter at hand. She was selective about who she served and was overall rude.-(Kicking customers out the door) Then Chuck, the manager, and his waitress came up to our table well before closing hour and started moaning about how he is closing soon and was trying to kick us out in advance!-(Ignoring customers) The last time we came here, we sat outside as the waitress Nicole was serving someone else. Although we said \"hi\", *she blatantly ignored us* and we had to walk into the restaurant and talk to the manager JUST TO PLACE OUR ORDER. It was so bad. We watched the manager baby-sit the waitress as he told her \"you have customers waiting for you, Nicole.\"But she had seen us before and consciously ignored us.A few minutes after we came back out to dine outside, Nicole (the waitress) walked towards us and gave us a very phony smile. -(Insolent manager) On this other occasion, Chuck (The Manager) was chatting with us after dinner and he called my friend a \"Liar\" simply because he was trying to get him to guess where we were from. He also called us \"Disingenuous\" for the same reason.-(Summary) Overall, The Courier Cafe has great food, but due to a grumpy and harassing Manager, and rude waitresses who need to be *told* that they have tables waiting for them, we are strongly considering never dining there again.", 
      "Awesome breakfast menu, it is a favorite of ours for that. Lunch and onward is more average. I recommend the charritos or the milkshakes.", 
      "We found this place based on several previous Yelp reviews. \u00a0We were not disappointed.The building that this cafe is in was apparently the former home of the Urbana Courier newspaper. \u00a0It is decorated in late 1800's - early 1900's decor. \u00a0The antiques in this place are worth a visit on their own. \u00a0There is a 1920's mechanical gumball machine that is well worth the 25 cent price.The waitress was full of energy and very friendly. \u00a0She paid special attention to my daughter, which I love from any server...as long as they are not weird men. \u00a0I started with a Two Brothers Domaine DuPage draft ($4.00). \u00a0It was delicious...kind of sweet with just a hint of hoppiness. \u00a0I ordered the The Famous Courier Reuben ($7.95). \u00a0The corned beef on this was so tender it practically chewed itself. \u00a0The sauerkraut add just the right hint of bitterness. \u00a0The grilled rye bread was perfect. \u00a0I topped it with what tasted like homemade Thousand Island dressing and horseradish. \u00a0This sandwich was big. \u00a0I was stuffed after finishing it. \u00a0I opted for no sides with this. \u00a0I shared some of my wife's sweet potato chips. \u00a0They were crisp but seemed to be lacking of any real substance. \u00a0I ended the meal with a hand dipped chocolate milkshake ($3.75). \u00a0It was creamy, cool and refreshing. \u00a0The perfect ending to this outstanding meal. \u00a0This place will definitely be in our Yelp bookmarks. \u00a0We will be back.", 
      "I feel like Mugatu (played by Will Ferrell) in Zoolander (watch, it's only 5 secs of your life): youtube.com/watch?v=AG7L\u2026. I am SO SURPRISED by the reviews here! Did I come on a bad night?! This place was seriously bad!I went there with a bunch of friends and it was just underwhelming. Given the lack of customers, service was pretty slow. There were only a few menus for us to look at, and the ones that we got were covered with crayon and torn-- but the waitress was nice.My friends got the gazpacho but they said that it was fermented (i.e., \u00a0old). I tried it and thought the same, WTH? I got the Courier burger-- simple bacon cheeseburger with fries. The burger was huge but it was extremely dry like sandpaper. I hate putting ketchup and mustard on a \u00a0burger, but I had to just to get the moisture back in my mouth! The fries are NOT fries, they're potato wedges. Have you ever been to Mcdonalds? Fries should look and taste like that. Com'on.I then got The Headliner (two scoops of ice cream with fudge, peanuts, whip cream and a cherry). It was okay, but nothing spectacular-- Joe Schmo who lives out in the dumpster could've made it...probably faster too. Given that we were one of the few groups in the restaurant, it took way too long to make it. Courier Cafe is overrated.", 
      "Alright, Courier. \u00a0We meet again.I've gone a few more times and your staff has upped its game, even the older gentleman in the front is a LOT nicer. \u00a0I've come here 2-3 times late on a Saturday night just to read, and they don't give me a hard time and keep the coffee coming.And yes, it is all about those shakes. \u00a0No, seriously. \u00a0It is. \u00a0They're delicious, and you can combine flavors. \u00a0Sometimes I leave my house to go for the 20 minute walk for a milkshake. \u00a0It brings this boy to the cafe.", 
      "My god. \u00a0I was expecting a good breakfast. \u00a0Pretty good, even. \u00a0But I am a breakfast aficionado. \u00a0Breakfast is something I take very seriously. \u00a0And I am not lenient in my judgments of breakfast foods.That said: My god. \u00a0And furthermore: Holy bejesus.Their corned beef hash was otherworldly. \u00a0It is, without question, the most perfect and wonderful corned beef hash I have ever eaten. \u00a0It was bumped beyond that by the addition of sauteed mushrooms. \u00a0This was served with eggs (sunny side up--the only kind to eat with hash), rye toast, and hashbrowns. \u00a0For $7.25, that is a metric ton of food. \u00a0I'm still kind of full, and it's been nearly 8 hours. \u00a0My dining companions had french toast and pancakes with meat sides (FYI, a 'full plate' of sausage links amount to two full-sized brats), and they were delicious. \u00a0Not as delicious as the corned beef hash, but good, nonetheless.I anxiously await my next visit.", 
      "My sister recently moved to Champaign-Urbana for grad school, and being that I was in Bloomington-Normal this past weekend, I couldn't NOT go down to C-U for a visit. \u00a0I asked her to investigate some places we could get brunch, and she found Courier Cafe. \u00a0She said one of her girlfriends said it was really good.So, we got there and put our name in. \u00a0The restaurant is small, but homey, lots of antiques, reminded me of being at my grandma's old house. \u00a0We waited for maybe 20 minutes for a table.When we sat, we were given lunch menus. \u00a0When I inquired as to if they were still serving breakfast, one person said \"I don't know, let me check,\" one said \"no\" and the hostess came over and explained that we would've had to have been there by 11:45 to get on the \"breakfast waiting list.\" \u00a0It would've been nice if someone explained this to us when we got there, because 2 of the 3 of us REALLY wanted breakfast, and came to find it unavailable. \u00a0I was really disappointed. \u00a0I love breakfast. \u00a0I almost cried, legitimately.I digress. \u00a0There were plenty of tasty looking things on the menu, and I liked that all of their breads are made in-house. \u00a0Everyone enjoyed what they had. \u00a0My sister had the turkey croissant, and my boyfriend had the turkey club with a cup of chili.I had the Courier burger, which came with thick sliced bacon and cheddar cheese. \u00a0I could tell right away this burger was going to be delicious. \u00a0It was cooked on a flat-top griddle, which imparts such good flavor. \u00a0The patty was perfectly seasoned, and the cheese and bacon were just right. I didn't add ANY condiments or garnishes to the burger, just ate it as is. \u00a0The bun was a perfect brioche-y, eggy delight.Lunch for three came to $33.00. \u00a0I will certainly return the next time I am in Champaign, and try to get there early enough for breakfast.", 
      "When I arrived in \"Chambana\" (just kidding, that's not a fucking word) my freshman year I was saddened by the lack of Diners, Drive-ins, and/or dives.But - tucked away inconspicuously on a side street of Downtown Urbana is the Courier Cafe, an amazing little place that you'll want to come back to for every meal. The other reviewers have summated the greatness of this place pretty well, so I'll just add in how great the prices are. I had a rib-eye steak sandwich, iced tea, and a mocha milkshake for about $13. I could not eat another bite the rest of that Saturday Night, phenomenal. The ambiance is also great, the building feels very \"homey\" with all the wood paneling and old-school wallpaper.SO,go, eat, and drink milkshakes: for places such as the Courier are getting harder and harder to find!", 
      "One of the mainstays in Downtown Urbana. Can hardly get a seat during a home-football weekend because of all the Alumni that come back and want some delicious, homestyle food. Their breakfast is some of the best in town. Wait staff is friendly and their food is quite good. If you are trying to get breakfast/lunch here on a weekend it is a good idea to get there early because there will often be a decent line.", 
      "The other night, my girlfriend and I went out to the Courier Cafe in downtown Urbana. Having been there before, I knew that it was a good place to go for a relatively cheap meal (which is why I capitulated rather quickly). Courier Cafe is one of the older restaurants in downtown Urbana, having been open since 1980. As such, it has outlasted many other downtown Urbana businesses, and enshrined their memory in the names of its burgers.Speaking of burgers, they are the primary reason I go to the Courier Cafe. Burgers are around $5-6, and are 1/3 of a pound. The burgers also tend to be higher quality than the standard pub fare, considering people go there for food, instead of ordering a burger as an afterthought.On this night I opted for the Darcy's burger, which is a burger with mushrooms and bleu cheese. The burger comes on a plate with all of the other assorted toppings, including onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and pickles, off to the side, so you can add them to taste. The burger comes well done unless you specify otherwise. The meat itself is relatively juicy for being a grilled burger, and the bun tastes more like it came from a genuine bakery, instead of a store-brand 8 pack of buns, which often ends up being the case in burger restaurants.Another thing Courier is known for is its old-style sweet drinks, such as its phosphates and New York egg creme drinks. These are sugary soda-type drinks with flavored syrup, with the egg creme being a phosphate with an egg cracked into it and creme added. Courier also has a variety of ice cream desserts.Courier's wine and beer menu is not very extensive, but they have had Rogue Dead Guy on draft for $4 the last few times I have gone, which is cheaper than most bars in the area. In addition, their bottled beers are relatively cheap, and the wine by the glass is inexpensive as well. Though the menu is not extensive, there is a good enough variety to please most individuals.For two people with burgers, drinks, and one order of fries, the total bill ended up being $18.84. This is much lower than one would pay for an equivalent meal anywhere else, even a place like Murphy's (which has a similar food menu, though lower quality food). Courier is a perfect spot for a cheap date, where your date won't know you're being cheap unless you let her see the check."

      "This is the place I take everyone that visits me from out of town. It's delicious for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and it's cheap, so price is never an issue. The burgers are great, the breakfasts are delicious, but that's not the reason I'm here so often.The real reason is the Chocolate Egg Creams. For those of you that aren't familiar, the chocolate egg cream, originating in New York (as far as I've heard), contains milk (not cream), chocolate syrup, and seltzer. That's right, no egg. The egg creams at Courier are delicious, however, you should all know, they are NOT authentic egg creams as they contain egg whites to help the top foam up. At any rate, very few places these days have egg creams, so it's great that this place still does. (But if nowhere near you has them and you want to try, they're way easy to make. My version: Fill a glass 1/3 with milk, add syrup til liquid height is 1/2 up the class, fill the rest of the way with seltzer, stir, taste, add more syrup if you wish!)", 
      "U of I is our favorite University, we love the football, our whole family has gone there and when we want beer and pizza, Champaign-Urbana is the place to be. \u00a0The floors are sticky and the bathrooms gross but Campus abounds in places with Orange and Blue ambiance.But when we want a good breakfast before the game, a really good burger after the game or an ice cream rush before the drive home, this Illini family heads to Courier Cafe, with nostalgic 70's decor and honest food. \u00a0For breakfast, I prefer the Courier, for lunch any burger plus the sweet potato fries and for ice cream, definitely the Misprint Sundae. \u00a0If you want fancier, head down the street to its sister establishment, Silver Creek. \u00a0For an off campus comfort food experience, go to Courier. \u00a0Tell 'em the Chief sent you.", 
      "One of the nice places to eat in Chambana where the prices are reasonable and the food is plain yummy! \u00a0Not a franchise - yeaaaahhhhh! \u00a0The atmosphere has a lot of character with stained glass and other antiques (some of the stories about the antiques are on the menu - very interesting).My three kids and I all enjoyed our meals. \u00a0The hamburgers are excellent as are the shakes. Oh yes, the kids also loved the cookies in the front case were great on-the-road treats!", 
      "Eh...Decor is a turn-off. I understand the antique-homey kind of feel that this place was going for, but...it ended up just seeming dirty and in need of some updates.As for the food, it was average...nothing great. It's pretty telling if I can't even remember what I ordered; it's that forgettable. And holy cow, the waitress was beyond cranky; she was rather rude and inattentive.Considering this place is one of the only palatable-breakfast places in the area, I splurged to give Courier 2 stars, although I probably will not be coming back.", 
      "Courier has really darn good breakfast food. \u00a0My friend got the almond french toast. \u00a0It was light and delectable. \u00a0Especially good if you use orange marmalade instead of the syrup. \u00a0Try it!I was really craving just your basic diner breakfast- eggs, bacon, hash browns, and toast. \u00a0Everything was right on. \u00a0I devoured almost all the food and that's pretty rare for me. \u00a0The hash browns were a particular stand out. \u00a0Crispy on the outside and almost creamy-soft within. \u00a0Yum.They bake all the bread in-house and my toast was delish. \u00a0There's a case full of bakery-style treats, not sure if those were baked in house as well.Eggs, bacon, and toast were all pretty good as well. \u00a0I was not disappointed with anything. \u00a0I've yet to try the phosphates or milkshakes. \u00a0Combining flavors for a choc/peanut butter shake has been on my mind lately, tho...My four stars are for breakfast only; the three star holds for lunch/dinner.", 
      "Went here over homecoming weekend with my brother, thanks to reviews from Yelp. A big breakfast is always a good way to kick off a day.I picked up a Denver Omelette with hash browns -- as much as I wanted to try the Spanish Omelette with chorizo, something about tequila in my eggs didn't really sound quite right. It was good. The omelettes here aren't mile-high and fluffy; they're more traditional omelettes, but still made with fresh ingredients.The hash browns were pretty good. Both maybe could have used a little more seasoning, but I was satisfied with both items.Now, the almond french toast -- if you like your french toast sweet, this is the item for you. The batter was spiked with serious amount of almond extract, and once you pour maple syrup over it... watch out! Still, it was very good. What few sips I had of the New York Egg Cream were also quite good. The chocolate flavor was pretty good (perhaps not as dark as I prefer, but... I have no idea what a New York Egg Cream is supposed to taste like) and also very sweet.For a basic breakfast, I wasn't blown away, but I would definitely go back to Courier Cafe for a good breakfast the next time I visit Urbana.", 
      "I've been told by many friends to take a visit to the courier cafe. So with much pressure, I gave in. \u00a0What was I thinking? Even today I still am not quite sure. I was really hungry and had been looking for something to satiate my lunch needs. I decided on the quesedillas and my bf ordered the pesto veggie pita. \u00a0Let me say that neither was really that good, especially the pesto pita. \u00a0The presentations of the food left something to be desired. The one thing that was tasty on the menu was the chocolate peanut butter shake. Not sure if a shake really has the ability to bring me back to a restaurant, and in this case it doesn't. \u00a0The shake is what is bringing my review from 1 star to 2. The whole place is totally overrated and looks so unkempt.", 
      "Five stars for the ice cream. \u00a0Hands down. \u00a0No questions asked. \u00a0Do not even think about Steak and Shake. You must come here for their homemade ice cream that they use for delicious shakes and the highly recommended sundaes (see picture).As for the regular food, 3 stars in quality, 2 stars for how I wish fries came with my meal. \u00a0I had the turkey croissant, which was good but gave me a vibe of how I could have made it at home. \u00a0I do not like how fries are not automatically included with sandwiches (see picture). \u00a0However, my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy his Southern Fried Chicken. \u00a0The Skinny Dippers were to die for, literally, there's sour cream, bacon and cheese on them!The ambiance is great and classic. \u00a0They have an ample number of wooden booths and a beautiful copper ceiling. \u00a0The menu looks like it came from a printing press used to advertise the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, for which I believe they have pictures of on the walls.I would recommend Courier Caf\u00e9 as great place to top off a dinner date meal, take your family, or catch up with friends. \u00a0During nice weather they have outdoor seating.", 
      "Courier Cafe milkshakes are the BEST IN THE WORLD.Seriously...their milkshakes are to die for. It's awesome because they'll give you one glass, plus a metal cup of the stuff that didn't fit in the glass. Perfect for sharing...or for splurging. Every single milkshake I've had here has been thick, creamy, and full of hand-dipped goodness.One of my favorites: peanut butter and fudge.In terms of food, their salad bar is always a good choice (fresh and lots of variety), and I really like their chicken pesto pita. Whatever you order, though, make sure you get a milkshake!", 
      "Oh how I miss Courier Cafe. Every single time I come back to C/U for something I try and grab lunch here. I've never had a bad meal here. The Banker's Burger is fantastic, the Monkey Stuff sandwich sounds weird, but is amazing. Some of the sandwiches are obscene in their size. Asking for a side of mayo is a mistake as they will bring you a 1/4 of mayo. The sweet potato chips are delicious. They also have a salad bar that has a decent selection.But ignore all of what I said above because none of it matters. Even if Courier had the worst lunch and breakfast food on earth, I'd still go for the shakes. Oh my god the shakes. I get the shakes thinking about their shakes. Feeling like a high roller? Order the apple pie shake. Some of the waitresses will not know what you are talking about, but once you explain it to them, they will make it. Piece of apple pie + ice cream + blender = apple pie shake. They will charge you for both a slice of pie and a shake, and it is worth every penny. Great to take your date who isn't watching her figure (or is way too damn skinny and needs to bulk up a bit). Seriously, stop reading and go get an apple pie shake!", 
      "I joined Heather T for breakfast, and she's right. My cholesterol goes up just thinking about that menu. The corn beef hash had a pound of salt in it, the bacon was drippy, and the sausage links were about the size of a bratwurst. It was great. I'd go back in a second.The restaurant is of the \"encased in time\" style of decor. The old wood booths are awesome, and the place is filled with antiques. The fact that the menu details the history of those antiques is a nice touch.", 
      "I am quite disappointing since I expect it to be a four star restaurant. The milkshake here is pretty yummy. But the salmon fillet here is overcooked. The fish is dry and burn and just hard as stone. More consideration before coming will be my suggestion.", 
      "Delicious food! \u00a0I haven't been here for a few years. \u00a0I remember the potato skins and the milkshakes. \u00a0Ummm, yummy milkshakes! \u00a0The burgers are pretty good too. \u00a0So...the reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 is that I worked here a few years back. \u00a0I worked at the salad bar area (pretty good salad bar, too). \u00a0When I was working, I did see a few roaches. \u00a0I must say that since working there, I haven't really eaten at this place. \u00a0Roaches are gross! \u00a0I really hope they've fixed this problem since then because their food is pretty good.", 
      "DO NOT go here if you are looking for some \"chrome and glass-ubermodern-quail egg topped with scallion serving-trying too hard to be trendy\"cafe. DO go here if you are looking for decent Midwestern breakfast, served in a cozy(albeit kitschy) venue for a decent price. \"Woo\" for:1) Yummy biscuits that are an option instead of toast2) Tasty-sounding pancake options (including the special that day-- pumpkin)3) A place that I can get an old fashioned chocolate soda(Hellllooooo)\"Boo\" for:1) A waitress who mistook my coffee order(I got regular instead of the cinnamon almond, which was the special)2) A waitress who slops coffee all over the table when setting down our mugs, and then never cleans it up, but clearly eyeballs the running liquid several times when passing by3) Regular coffee that was so weak it looked like broth when I added a dollop of cream4) Cold hash browns(not that I had room to eat them anyway)I was assured that the service is usually much better--and more friendly. I guess they were caught off guard with the rush of Dad's Weekend? Menu options were enticing, so I'll be back!", 
      "This is an update to my full review below. \u00a0I have been chided by yelp message -- probably from the owner or his friend -- that it is OK to call a tortilla dish \"rarebit.\" \u00a0My feeling is that if you were going for a zany take on rarebit that an insider would get, no luck. I moved here from Britain. When I saw the tortilla labeled \"rarebit\" my reaction was: This place doesn't know what they are doing. Admittedly, the item on the menu labeled \"spanish\" is far weirder.", 
      "The price is reasonable, food is good, parking is free. I like rib eye sandwich a lot.", 
      "I'm a little bias about this place since my Great Grandfather and Great Great Grandfather owned this place when it was a newspaper and printing business. The building has a lot of nostalgia for me.So, the atmosphere is awesome (especially knowing relatives had spent so much time in it) and keeps its old charm. \u00a0The restaurant owners have done a nice job keeping the historic feel while not going tacky.We were there for breakfast. I've heard lunch and dinner are so-so. Our breakfasts were all very good: fresh, tasty and good portions. Nothing that makes you call it the best you ever had, but great basic food nonetheless. I'll go back for breakfast at the Courier next time I'm in town.Have to say the service was outstanding: super friendly, fast, unobtrusive. Go give the Courier a try...and say hi to the ghosts for me.", 
      "The food is great. The atmosphere is very comforting. The wait staff is always friendly.Be sure to try the Bennet Burger (it's not on the menu anymore, but they can still make it).", 
      "I've eaten here occasionally in the time that I've lived in the area (my whole life), and it's never very memorable (the food, that is). The building itself is really cool looking inside, but the food is just okay... in fact, I know I'd prefer cooking at home to overpaying here. Also, the waitress I had the other day was really rude. Might be a good place for an awkward first date.", 
      "I'm a fan of the Courier. I've always had great service. Unfortunately, today I was very disappointed. After being seated, we were ignored for nearly fifteen minutes. After we saw another table that arrived after us get service within a minute of sitting down, we left. It was very frustrating. The busboy placed waters on our table and left us waiting. We were passed by multiple times without one server asking us anything. Ironically after we left, the hostess thanked us for our business and was completely oblivious of the fact that we had only arrived 15 minutes before.", 
      "I give it 3 stars for lunch and dinner because I really only think the place is okay. \u00a0It has a nice decor but the food is just regular American. \u00a0They rave about their hand dipped shakes but again, I can't figure out the difference between theirs and Steak and Shake. \u00a0I think the menu is simply a little boring.I give it 4 stars because I think the breakfast is a LOT better. \u00a0Be sure to get there before 11:30 for this! \u00a0I really like their Spanish omelette (if you like chorizo.. or a spicy sausage.. this is for you!), corned beef hash, and biscuits and gravy (half portion suffices in my opinion). \u00a0Oh.. and their pancakes are really REALLY good because they use fresh fruit. \u00a0Try the blueberry! \u00a0The strawberry is good.. but not as good as the blueberry.", 
      "One of my absolute favorites in CU, Courier Cafe is the best place to relax and get some delicious American food. Old fashioned soda fountain favorites like phosphates and malt shakes make this place unique, but nearly everything is good. Sandwiches are on fresh bread, \u00a0and burgers are thick and hearty. There are a lot of vegetarian options- my favorite is the pesto grilled swiss on sourdough. I also love the ham melt on a fresh croissant. For dessert I recommend sharing a headliner, a monstrously delicious sundae drenched in hot fudge.For the quality of food you get, this place is actually a bargain. I'd prefer it over most of CU's \"fine dining\" establishments any day. Service can be slightly slow, but overall this is one of my favorite places to enjoy after a difficult test or a arduous paper-writing spree.", 
      "I've eaten at a lot of great places in my absence, so prepare for a string of gushing reviews.Despite being extremely busy on a home-game day, our group of 4 was able to score outdoor seating pretty much right away.Our waitress was nice, and as attentive as she could be for having to wait on 10 tables at once. \u00a0You could tell the cafe was going for more of an old school thing with it's antique register, wooden... everything, menu items, etc.For brunch on such a gorgeous, late summer day, my friends and I knew we HAD to sit outside. \u00a0I can definitely see myself coming back to relax with a newspaper/book and a sandwich. \u00a0Plus, I hear their milkshakes are pretty good so I guess I'll have to try that out as well!Did I mention their portions here are pretty much huge? \u00a0My friend and I split their Dagwood, and Desert Dippers (healthy, right?) and were STUFFED afterwords. \u00a0The quality of the food itself wasn't anything special, but it still hits the spot when you haven't had anything to eat all day (like us).I'll be back here for sure.", 
      "I usually come here for the salad bar, but when it comes down to it, the quality is mediocre at best. \u00a0The regular sandwich and entree items are better but also not incredible. \u00a0The staff can be rude and noisy if you have the misfortune of sitting near the salad bar area.If you're looking for something inexpensive and fast, this is a great choice. \u00a0Otherwise, eh.", 
      "The Courier Cafe has long been a great place to get delicious and well prepared food in Urbana. The decor has literally not changed in decades, and suits it well.For this visit, the wife and I ate small. She had a quesadilla with sweet potato fries (chips, actually) and I had the potato skins along with a ham and cheese.Funny thing about their sandwiches. The inside is warm, but the bread is soft, not toasted. That was strange. The potato skins have changed, and I think this must depend on who is cooking. I didn't like these as much as the old ones. The old version was literally potato \"boats\". The new version are more like fries. I was told the quesadilla was only fair, not great. I ordered the phosphate as always, and it was a little bland.Maybe they need to up the quality of their food again. I wouldn't rush to go back as I always have.", 
      "I picked this place because I thought it would be good for a group setting. The people I traveled with had different dietary restrictions and I like to make sure I can cater to them all. This place worked, but the food was standard. I definitely wasn't expecting mind blowing food, but when it comes to a cafe I'd like the food to be comforting. My burger reminded me of a day at the park where you buy frozen burger patties from Costco and throw em on the grill. Where's In-and-Out when I need them? They also wouldn't cook my french fries extra crispy for some reason which was also another negative. The highlight was probably the hot fudge sundae but as a reminder, unless you like eating dessert as dinner, share that sucker with someone. I'd go here again if I wanted something super casual and laid back. But since I usually travel here with a band wagon of people, I'll have to take them elsewhere.", 
      "Best salad bar I've ever had......great prices....great soup!!!! \u00a0My favorite place to eat lunch! Must go if you've never been. Long lines out the door during peak times..so plan accordingly!", 
      "I have been here too many times to count. I have never left anything other than happy, though eating pretty good and relatively cheap food tends to do that to me. I was holding off on yelping this place as it has been done to death and I don't have much to say, other than: 1) I suggest you try the phosphates (old fashioned soda pop), 2) they reportedly have good hangover treatment burgers, 3) their salad bar is pretty darn good, 4) you should sit in the front, not the back, and 5) if both price and ambiance is important to you, this is one of the best places to eat in Urbana, especially for breakfast.I guess I did have a lot to say.", 
      "I've been to the Courier frequently and without bias, I can say it is perhaps one of my favorite places to dine in all of Champaign-Urbana. Small, local, with plenty of great options for food. Whether it's the Banker's Burger, a Red Hot News sundae, a green river phosphate, any of their vegetarian dishes, or even just the sweet potato chips, the food is delicious and perfect each time, all for a great low price and friendly service. I've never been ignored and always seem to have a full glass of water without even knowing they swung by.The one thing that keeps Courier from being a super 5-star is if you're seated at anything other than a booth, it seems like you're one inch away from being knocked about by any of the staff or other patrons. Don't come if you have more than four people, it'll be next to impossible to keep you all together. However, I think Courier's still a great cozy place to get your grub on.", 
      "Good sandwiches and ice cream sundaes", 
      "I dragged my asian wife here saying she had to try it, and she said, \"Why? \u00a0Why?\" and when she saw the menu, she was horrified because the food is essentially, country cooking, burgers, sandwiches. \u00a0However, it's the healthiest and freshest and best-tasting venue of its type in the history of CU, and they continue the tradition of Bubby & Zadies by offering a salad bar with amazing offerings. \u00a0She was amazed and wanted to come back. \u00a0Then, I dragged my 81-year old mom to the place, and she was aching and complaining about the steps and getting there, but she left with a HUGE grin on her face and she had a wonderful time!Best shakes in CU, bar none.Best ice cream deserts in CU, bar none.One of the top-3 venues in CU, the old Courier newspaper offices with plaster-decorated ceilings, tallback wooden booths, and a 1910 feel to it. \u00a0Very friendly waittresses !! \u00a0The only place I can think of that competes with it in terms of a Venue is a cafe near the old train station, but I think that closed 2 decades ago ...This is a popular late-night place to go after Contra Dancing in Crystal Lake Park, or even dancing at the Regent ballroom. \u00a0The food is priced very reasonably and this is one of the few places in CU that is a candidate as a great \"hangout\" ~ a place where you can come all the time, and get to know the staff.DO NOT MISS VISITING THE COURIER CAFE !!!", 
      "Hands down one of my favorite places in CU. \u00a0The prices are very fair, the food is good, they offer a nice variety and the atmosphere is fantastic. \u00a0The shakes are well worth every last one of the million or so calories they contain.Minus one star because they don't handle carry out very well. \u00a0I've never had an order get mixed up when eating in, but there's about a 30% chance of a screw-up when getting carry out. \u00a0To the credit of the manager, when I brought this to his attention he was really apologetic, personally verified that my order was correct, and gave me my next meal on the house. \u00a0So they get the star back =).", 
      "We had a great experience here. Very friendly, helpful staff; nice kids' menu, lots of flavorful vegetarian selections; and amazing ice cream! We will certainly be back often.", 
      "It's ALL about the peanut butter and chocolate milkshake.I usually get the reuben sandwich or an omelet, but it's really the milkshake that keeps me coming back.", 
      "Courier has been around a long time. I know them mostly for their sandwiches, shakes, and soups. They make some really good beef and chicken chili. Their sandwiches can be a little on the small side. In a recent trip back, I ordered a corn beef sandwich, and i thought it was a little light on the meat from what I remembered a few years ago when \u00a0I went to school at U of I. That being said, it did taste good. The meat was not dry and it had good flavor, but nothing spectacular. The waitress was courteous and attentive. Still a great place to grab a bite in downtown Urbana.", 
      "You here a lot of great things about this place and I think that was the issue for me, I had pretty high expectations. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, we liked our experience, the food was tasty and made to order, and the service was solid. We went for a late lunch, so the atmosphere was dead and seeing \u00a0the older restaurant left nothing to the imagination. But there was nothing GREAT about this place...in the same light, there was nothing bad either.It's worth to check it out and I will be back to give it another shot.", 
      "A star for the delcious salad bar.A star for the shakes and soda fountain.A star for the yummy veg options.and a star for huge delicious burgers.One of my favorite places to eat in CU! (If the service was better - I would've given the place 5 stars)", 
      "Great food!", 
      "Courier was one of my favorite spots for fooding back in the day. The quaint, rustic decor and simple menu definitely shouldn't deter anyone from trying this place out. The shakes are amazing (not too overwhelmingly sweet) and I love that they give you all of what they make - even the portion that doesn't fit in the cup. The burgers are classic - simple, no frills, good meat, fresh toppings, cooked to perfection. I'd also highly recommend the brunch menu here. Alas, it was a rare occasion that I would be awake for it but you can learn from my mistakes and get yourself some delicious brunch at Courier.For such a historic building, Courier Cafe has done a great job of preserving the past and giving people a taste of the olden times.", 
      "Tourists Treated Same As Home Folks. I used to be home folks, returned as a tourist, and it's true. This was always a place I brought visitors to show off midwestern charm. The food is comforting and good. It's not innovative fusion cuisine, it's darn good burgers and milkshakes in a cozy venue. Plus, old-fashioned soda fountain. Where else can you even get a phosphate anymore? And yes, the salad bar rules. When I lived near downtown Urbana I would sometimes come here for breakfast on a weekday. That was nice. Weekend breakfast is a zoo, WAY crowded, huge lines. There is a reason for that: it's THAT GOOD."

      "I come to Courier Cafe pretty regularly. \u00a0Their burger options are a good bargain. \u00a0I've always enjoyed their shakes- especially the strawberry or peanut butter. \u00a0I prefer to get the specials because I go there so often. \u00a0I had a delicious fish fillet sandwich with a HUGE fillet. \u00a0Then I got it again, and it was pretty small. \u00a0I noticed that sometimes the food isn't very consistent. \u00a0The one thing that might surprise you is that their salad bar is AMAZING. \u00a0I get a huge salad with everything on it. \u00a0Like a pound of salad for $5.00. \u00a0Leaves are pretty light, so a pound a salad is prettty huge.", 
      "Dessert. \u00a0Do it.I hear breakfast is pretty awesome as well. \u00a0Decor is cool, neat vibe, old historical building. \u00a0When I was a kid we had Farrell's (no longer) in the Bay Area for our sweet treats and for whatever reason the sundae I had reminded me of that. \u00a0Points for nostalgia!", 
      "Delicious amazing eclectic food choices. A favorite for me and my boyfriend (and a million other people because the place is always crowded, though there is never a long wait for a table).I wish more people went to this place because I think it really needs to be supported more by university kids.", 
      "I went here for breakfast, and we got seated for two right away. The waitress was super nice. The food- I have to say was just average. Maybe I had talked it up in my head too much. I had been craving french toast all week, and this Sunday breakfast was supposed to satisfy that craving- and it did not do it. I ordered the almond french toast with cinnamon raisin bread as suggested from our waitress. I had a side of the sweet maple links (eh) and hash browns. And it was just, average. I could have been eating at Denny's or any other diner. The ambiance is TOTALLY cute though. I would definitely be willing to try breakfast here again- maybe the pancakes are better?", 
      "This is one of the best hidden gems in Urbana! Located in downtown Urbana, Courier Cafe has an old classical cafe feel and decoration. I don't know to describe to be Old Victorian but it is old school for sure. The seats are all wood, wooden floors, dim lighting, classic wooden benches, and there is even an old school cash register. Definitely a blast in the past to the early 20th century. Very classy and clean place that had a warm, home feeling.The food? What can I say. AMAZING. It is just simple, American, home-cooking! I have had just about everything from the awesome burgers (which come in a ton of different ways), steak sandwich, soups, deep fried shrimp, most of the pies, and the sundaes. Best of all, it's all fairly cheap!The service was also awesome! I went here with a large party of nearly 20 people and I went here with just 3. Both times the service was amazing. There is this elderly guy there with glasses and he is just very nice, funny, and personable to us every time.I have made this a regular place for me to go when I am in the Urbana-Champaign area.", 
      "Some things never change. The Courier Cafe is one of them. I lived down here in C-U about 6 years ago and just moved back down here about a month ago. One of my friends suggested that we get a bite to eat here before checking out a play at the Station Theatre. I said sure, why not , haven't been there in ages. Anyway, the service was great. The pay as you go salad bar was reasonably priced and well stocked. I ordered a quesadilla which was good but not great and my friend had a buffalo chicken wrap that was also good but not great.There was nothing wrong with the food or service but besides the cute ambience there's nothing special about this place. I hear the milkshakes are amazing though.", 
      "Came here for a late lunch and was pretty disappointed by the service. \u00a0Our waiter took our order promptly enough and we received our food. \u00a0The sandwich I ordered was on the wrong bread and I spent what seemed like forever waiting for the waiter to come back around. \u00a0In the meantime I discovered that there was also a hair in the sandwich. \u00a0I eventually managed to flag him down and asked about the bread. \u00a0He took it back to the kitchen and when he came back, told me that they were out of the bread I ordered. \u00a0Ok...so why didn't someone come out and ask me what I wanted instead, rather than just making it with something else and hoping I wouldn't notice? \u00a0Seems pretty straightforward. \u00a0I got a new sandwich and by that time my boyfriend was almost done eating.After that, our waiter never bothered even stopping by our table again to check in, other than walking by to drop off the check.Sandwich was good (...the second one, sans hair) although the \"special sauce\" appeared to just be a mustard...maybe they were out of that too.", 
      "I love this place's decor, sometimes I just go for the atmosphere. \u00a0I used to get the burgers here, they're ok, better than any others I can find in Urbana. \u00a0I think the star of the show is the milkshakes though.Pretty cheap considering how much better it is than Green St options, so if you have a car I would check it out.", 
      "We went to get lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. Waited for about 15-20 minutes for a table. VERY cramped waiting area. Menu had a lot of options. I went with the \"Monkey Stuff\" sandwich - this sweet, delectable sandwich of tasty sugary goodness. This sandwich would have been way better had the bread been toasted. By the end I just felt like I was eating a mush of sugar. To counteract this sugar, I also ordered from the salad bar. I liked the layout of the Salad Bar - you pay $0.38 per oz of salad you get, so I had a filling salad to go with my sweet sandwich for only $2.50! Not a very diverse salad bar, but I was fairly pleased.The other members of my party enjoyed their meal just fine, but we didn't feel this was anything special. The decor of the restaurant is very vintage, so it ;s kind of dark and has a different feel to it. After reading the reviews, I'm bummed I didn't order a milkshake! I don't know that we'd necessarily make a special trip to come back here.", 
      "Courier Cafe is one of my favorite places in Urbana!They have the best ice cream sundae in town.. THE MISPRINT..Its small and the perfect size for desert--(And its under $4) I feel this is a great date place or conversation place because you could just order shakes and nothing else and stay for hours without being rushed out by wait staff. \u00a0They also have incredible shakes, and rueben sandwiches.", 
      "I've been in town for a year and I can't believe that I have never 1) been here before; and 2) heard of this place before. \u00a0In the past year I have eaten at most non-chain restaurants in town (no exaggeration) and every restaurant that gets rave reviews. \u00a0I was looking for a different place to try and of course turned to Yelp. \u00a0After searching around I decided to drive over to Urbana and try the Courier Cafe.I'm not one judges a place on decor. \u00a0I rate solely on food and service. \u00a0I'm not a snob and would rather eat great food at a hole in the wall than eat sub-par food at a place with extravagant and/or trendy decor. \u00a0I only mention this, because some reviewers mentioned the decor as part of the reason they gave this place low ratings. \u00a0It is obvious when you walk in that they want the decor to fit the age of the building. \u00a0It was lowly lit and had decor that matched their intent. \u00a0Again, none of that mattered to me.On to the food and service. \u00a0I ordered the pork tenderloin with a pineapple bourbon glaze. \u00a0It came with a salad bar, potato, and a roll. \u00a0I started with the salad bar. \u00a0It was a well maintained and stocked salad bar. \u00a0The girl behind the salad bar was constantly keeping it clean and filling it. \u00a0The item I enjoyed the most from the salad bar was the raspberry vinaigrette. \u00a0It is likely that it comes from a jar, but if they made it kudos to them. \u00a0I had a sweet potato and it was like any other sweet potato. \u00a0The entree, the pork tenderloin with the pineapple bourbon glaze was absolutely amazing. \u00a0The tenderloin was actually two whole pieces of tenderloin that were perfectly charred. \u00a0The glaze was a perfect sweet that balanced well with the tenderloin. \u00a0I only ate one of the tenderloins, because I wanted to save room for a milkshake. \u00a0I ordered the hot fudge milkshake. \u00a0As others have already noted they do make the best milkshake in town and they rival the best milkshake you've had anywhere. \u00a0We move onto the service. \u00a0My waitress was absolutely amazing. \u00a0She was spot on with the recommendations she gave me. \u00a0She was quick and attentive when it came to filling my water. \u00a0To top it all off she gave me the excess milkshake, which amounted to 2/3 of an additional shake. \u00a0Of course she was tipped well for her service. \u00a0Finally, the value. \u00a0This place is an absolute value. \u00a0My meal with the shake came out to $17. \u00a0The burgers and sandwiches are priced from $4.25-$7.50 and the entrees are priced from around $10-$16 and come with plenty of food. \u00a0You'd pay 30-50 percent more for similar items in town. \u00a0They really could raise their food prices and would certainly be within reason in doing so.Where does this place rank in regards to the best places in Champaign/Urbana? \u00a0I would put it up there with my favorite place Black Dog. \u00a0It is obviously different food and a different overall experience so it would be unfair to say that it is better or worse than Black Dog, but I can say that it is comparable in regards to having good food and good service.", 
      "I have to agree that the milkshakes are wonderful. I love a mocha one. The 8 after 8 is a great deal.But....I have been with a group of people and met with an unfriendly reception when we wanted to eat at the Courier. The manager (I assume) acted as though he couldn't care less if he got our business or not. So...we went to a place nearby - and enjoyed ourselves.The wait staff is friendly, however.", 
      "I love this place! I have been here for only three times during the past two years of my stay at Urbana but all being in just past two months and I totally repent for not exploring this place earlier! I now even have a buddy who loves this place as much as I do and I am sure we are gonna visit more often here!This time we ordered veggie burgers (the garden salad and the black bean each) and a side order of Veggie dippers. The veggie dippers were amazing! I really like the sweet potato fries here and when combined with other veggies, it truely adds to the taste!I heard their milk shakes are awesome.. something to look forward to for the next visit!", 
      "Ate lunch at Courier Cafe today. I had not been here for quite some time.We had a short wait to get seated, which was understandable since we came just after noon. \u00a0I would probably prefer to come for breakfast, but that wasn't in the cards today.The service was very good. Our waitress was polite, food came in a reasonable time, and drinks were refilled regularly. We were also brought our check in a speedy manner, which I always like.Food: I had a buffalo chicken wrap, my wife had a hamburger and my son had a reuben sandwich and fries. All the food was very good.The only negative is the scrum at the front door/register when you are on the waiting list or paying your bill. Of course, part of the charm of Courier is the old time feeling the place gives, and a large waiting room would probably detract from that.Next trip: breakfast!", 
      "Having been here on several occasions, I would definitely recommend Courier Cafe. If wanting to try it, go for breakfast. They have a good selection, and I personally recommend one of the omelets. To finish, you must try one of the delicious milkshakes that they have. You will not be disappointed. I have also heard that their fountain sodas are excellent.In terms of service I have had my ups and downs, but mostly good. At times I have had to wait to checkout (at the front counter) which has been an annoyance.The location is nicely located near downtown Urbana, away from campus. The ambiance is nice, and there always seems to be a diverse customer base.Compared to other breakfast options in Champaign-Urbana, this would have to be one of my favorites - far superior to many of the other chain and diners.", 
      "I lived in Champaign twice within a decade for graduate school at UIUC. Without a doubt, I considered the Courier a go-to spot. It was great for weekend meals in an unstuffy environment with friends as well as for family gettogethers. Thanks for the memories, Courier. If you're looking for a good salad bar, this is the spot.", 
      "Adorable place! Historic building oozing with charm. Food was good and service was great! Full menu including vegan options. Win!", 
      "Had the Bayou burger, it was awesome!", 
      "The key word here is: inconsistent. There have been times when the food has been quite tasty, and at times just dreadful. Most of the time, I've been dissapointed. Once I got the wrong sandwich. But it was similar enough to the one that I ordered that the waitress didn't believe me. The pancakes are risky... Mostly undercooked or burnt, sometimes plates and silverware not washed well.The last time I went, my friend found a dead fly in her salad. Yuck! I told her to complain to the waiter, but she was too nice and didn't say anything. Needless to say, I'm pretty hesistant to go back. The ruben sandwiches are good. At least the times I've had them. But the cookies look very stale. This place is a real hit-or-miss, but the food is certainly not remarkable.", 
      "This is the best place for milkshakes in the area. If you're lucky they will give you your glass plus the extra.If you are getting an appetizer, get the skinny dippers (loaded potatoes).I've tried several sandwiches and wraps and I've always left satisfied.", 
      "Best breakfast in CU. \u00a0The Courier breakfast is fantastic, especially with the sausage links, which are essentially English bangers. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0When anyone visits town, I make a point to take them to Courier because it is such a good representation of what CU has to offer.The coffee selection is almost always great, and service is typically delightful.", 
      "First class breakfast served in an interesting and inviting atmosphere. \u00a0Ensconsed in an old building in downtown Urbana, Courrier Cafe is definitely a cut above the typical restaurants in U of I's hometown. \u00a0We were pleasantly surprised. \u00a0My wife had the 'Ham and Scram' and a side of pumpkin pancakes that were on special. \u00a0The eggs were well cooked and the ham was really tasty. \u00a0It had the right hint of smokines which I thought was particularly pleasant. \u00a0I had the Spanish omlette which, as usually happens in gringo joints, was billed as 'hot' by our waitress. \u00a0It was merely low-medium. \u00a0Generous shots of hot sauce kicked my dish up to the real heat level for me. \u00a0Delicious coffee and really nice bread that made excellent toast was also provided. \u00a0Attentive service (but the restaurant only had ten patrons when we were there - right at opening) so it may not be representative.Not worth a special trip to Champaign-Urbana, but if you are in town or even passing by, a slight detour to patronize it is worth it.", 
      "We came here while on vacation and the food and service is top notch. We got the Ruben sandwich and the chicken pitas. One with the fries and the other with sweet potato chips. All the items tasted fresh and were cooked perfectly. Also the quantity was more than we expected for the price, the corned beef was piled high and it was really filling. Our server was very nice and quick to help us out. The experience made our trip to Champaign much more enjoyable overall.", 
      "After reading all the reviews on Yelp, I had fairly expectations when I went to Courier Cafe. I went for dinner on a week night, and the place was almost completely empty. The food is American: sandwiches, burgers, soups, salads, and also more serious entrees. I was going to go for the salmon, but my waitress talked me out of it, so I ended up getting the pork chops, which came with soup. The soup was black bean soup: it was actually quite tasty, and the portion was huge (I expected just a small bowl, since it was supposed to be a side). I was almost full after finishing the soup and when the pork chops arrived, and that was a good thing because I was not too impressed by them... grilled pork chops lathered in bbq sauce, really nothing too exceptional, and the little side of salad that came with it didn't even have any dressing. So... the portion were huge, it was pretty cheap (I think I ended up paying under $15 including a soda), but the food did not impress me much. The service however was pretty friendly. I tried going again for brunch on a Sunday morning, but gave up when I saw the line... I guess it gets quite crowded on the weekend, which is generally a good sign, so I'll have to give it another try for brunch.", 
      "Dear Courier Cafe,I know you're a fabulous place -- cozy, sweet, with your antique accents, old-timey cash register and high, wooden booths. \u00a0I know you have friendly and skilled servers that have been happily working there for years who ask if you want separate checks before you even order. \u00a0I know your food is delicious and eclectic with your amazing, packed salad bar and uniquely named menu items like the Monkey Stuff sandwich with bananas, peanut butter, shredded coconut and honey; or your Rancheros Rarebit, the over-stuffed breakfast burrito doused in red sauce; or even simply, the Paperboy, Courier or Morning Edition breakfasts of eggs, toast, hash browns and choices of meats and fixin's. \u00a0 You carry baked goods like powdered-sugar-topped brownies, gigantic cookies and breads such as the \"Bubby Bun\" -- I know this. \u00a0I know that you can make me a super sundae loaded with nuts and fruity goodies, or a Green River Phosphate with whipped cream foaming over the side of my frosty mug. \u00a0I know that you have a different flavored coffee offered every day of the week in addition to your regular and decaf, and I know that you sell bags of each flavor so that we may enjoy them at home any time we want.I know all of these things....So, why is it that every time I think of you and your wonderful establishment (you won't be leaving us any time soon, I am sure), the one thing that comes to mind again and again......is your hand-dipped, peanut butter shake. \u00a0Sometimes I wonder if I should have malt or chocolate added to compliment the peanut butter, but I always go back to just plain peanut butter. \u00a0I don't even care if you forget the whipped cream (although, you never do). \u00a0Just give me the peanut butter blended smoothly into the vanilla ice cream, in a frosty mug or a foam to-go cup and I am elated. \u00a0I will wait and wait how ever long it takes (because I know people line up to partake of your fabulous fare) just to take that first, satisfying sipand slip into a frosty bit of heaven. \u00a0And thank you, thank you for always making a little too much so that you have to bring out the metal shaker with the extra shake bits for sharing with my friends. \u00a0Because you know it's very difficult to want to share this with anyone.There is one more thing I know. \u00a0I will always be back to visit you every time I'm in town. \u00a0Because I do. \u00a0Thank you, Courier Cafe.Love,Clarissa J.", 
      "a c-u tradidtion since 1980....housed in the now defunct urbana courier newspaper building, the courier cafe is a unique experience, if you've never been there....quaint brick building with a corner entrance - less than a mile from the U of I in downtown urbana.check out things like their awesome salad bar, green river phosphate (other flavors, too!), char-broiled burgers, or breakfast items like almond french toast. great, thick slices of bacon. good coffee. the dagwood sandwich - or the veggie dagwood if you prefer...for brunch today, i had their basic breakfast plus oj & coffee...and nicked a piece of almond french toast off the plate next to mine...ha-ha! (thanks, jane!)5 of us met there. we all used to work together - 4 RN's & 1 activity therapist. had a blast reminiscing about the old Mercy Hospital where we all worked - now Provena. (progress in motion....???)whatever...the courier rocks!", 
      "I sincerely believe that Courier Cafe can only do sandwiches and shakes well. A few weeks ago, I went to Courier Cafe and ordered fish. What I got in return was the bland little sad looking piece of fish about the size of a playing card. It was cod. It was flavorless. It was served with thin slices of lemon on top of it. It served no purposes other than to falsely suggest there would be some lemon-y taste. Also on the plate were three slices of cucumber and a slice of tomato. Not sure why. Perhaps it was there so that I could rate which item was the most bland on the plate.I have been to courier cafe a few times, and I've always ordered some sort of burger or sandwich. They always came out as expected for a sandwich. It tasted good and it was filling. This on the other hand, left me disappointed as I compared the value and price of my meal against my friend who ordered a sandwich that costed less. I left the restaurant hungry and actually went to another nearby restaurant to eat again.", 
      "If Ii were to get one chance at ordering a coffee or a chocolate milkshake, I would order it from Courier Cafe. Even though it's an old fashioned kind of spot; as in, old carpet, old(er) waitresses who may or may not be friendly, and old silverware. But there's nothing like a good old fashioned milkshake that's too think to get through a straw, and comes with the overflow in the metal mixing cup. Even on a cold winter day, I'll make my way over to the Courier Cafe. Any self-respecting milkshake connoisseur might do the same.", 
      "Came to Courier Cafe for brunch with some friends; this is a great place for small group of people to have a lazy weekend meal. Fortunately, we arrived early enough not to have to wait for a table, because this place got crowded really quickly. (For good reason!) I had a courier burger (burger with bacon) with fries and coleslaw. I really appreciate how they put the burger toppings on the side of the plate, because it lets you assemble the burger however you want to, and makes the dish more presentable. The burger came out very neat and clean; I didn't have to deal with a sauce-filled, drippy mess, like some other places. It was all very appetizing, though nothing to write home about. I would avoid the coleslaw, however, which was disastrously drenched in mayonnaise, and after a few bites, I just set it to the side untouched. I totally dig the antique-style decor in this restaurant. This is one of Urbana's landmark establishments; if you're looking for a place to enjoy a cozy meal with friends, definitely make a trip over here.", 
      "This place is an old standby, esp. with alums and old-timers. \u00a0Once upon a time, say around 20 years ago, there really weren't many places in town to eat that weren't fast food and weren't high end. \u00a0Courier bridged this gap, in a nice space. \u00a0In the meantime, MANY fine restaurants at all price points of come along, and the Courier has more or less stayed the same. \u00a0That is to say, good, but not great food, spotty service sometimes depending on the crowds, and often long waits.", 
      "This place had great phosphates. I had the green value one which is roughly lime and lemon soda with some creme. It was roughly 3.00 bucks. We both had the coulter breakfast with bacon and sausage, eggs, hash browns and toast. I would have given this a four or five but the host skipped my name and made us wait instead of 30 minutes about 50 minutes. \u00a0My name was never scribbed off the list so I was a bit upset with the unprofessionalism of that incident.", 
      "A unique place to eat. \u00a0I dig the atmosphere. \u00a0Food is always good. \u00a0But nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, compares with their shakes. \u00a0I miss them now that I've moved away. \u00a0There's nothing more to say. \u00a0Shakes. \u00a0Get one. \u00a0Get two. \u00a0They are that good.", 
      "Ok, the food's better than edible. \u00a0It's good, mostly.The service, though, has always been indifferent...if not leaning to rude.However, I'll probably go back again when I'm in Urbana and hungry. \u00a0But I've lowered my expectations!", 
      "Lots of comfort food at this local favorite. \u00a0The food, unfortunately, is not as good as it used to be and they crowd a few too many tables in the dining room. \u00a0It's almost a three-star, but since they've taken such good care of me all these years, and the service is good, it's still a winner in my book. \u00a0Shakes, burgers, and sandwiches, and a nice little salad bar. \u00a0The breakfast, however, is the reason to come. \u00a0It used to be the Courier newspaper, so there are historic artifacts from the old days.", 
      "The building has a long history and lots of character. It's plenty crowded at Saturday breakfast, a good sign that the locals like it. I enjoyed my whole wheat french toast, and thought the coffee was good. There's a metered parking lot just across the street east, free nights and weekends.", 
      "The Courier has been our go-to place for a quick \u00a0breakfast, lunch, dinner, or just for phosphates and ice cream in Downtown Urbana. I love the decor and the quiet, subdued atmosphere. The staff is generally great and accommodating.", 
      "My friend and I, being the old grammas we are, decided to have dinner at 4:50 pm....because we had been studying for a while and had super-munchies.I think one of the most appealing aspects of this restaurant is its warm inviting feel; it brings to mind a quaint country hotel. I like the dim lights, I like the booth-ed seats, and I like the salad bar set-up. The normal tables with pull-out seats however, were awkwardly arranged- the tables are kind of haphazardly mushed closed together. \u00a0Even the waitresses had trouble getting around the seats, I was asked about 3 times to move so the waitress could squeeze her way behind my seat to get to a big table of 5. I ended up ordering the Banker's Burger @ about $ 5.00(1/3 patty, swiss, mushroom, tomato on a toasty bun)and sweet potato fries for additional dollar. \u00a0Thank goodness the burger was delicious, because despite my friend and I getting there so early, it took almost a half hour for our food to come. The patty was done just perfectly, \u00a0and sat happily in my tummy. The sweet potato fries I wasn't too fond of though; they were more chips than fries. \u00a0Some of them were rather brown and burnt- the more orange coloured ones were really good, the crispier burnt ones left a very strong taste of charcoal in my mouth. \u00a0But overall, I would come again. The servers were slow, but very friendly. \u00a0And really, the price I paid for a whole VERY filling meal (about $7.50) was extraordinarily within my budget. =]", 
      "Great salad bar and service, but everything else is terrible. \u00a0Do not waste your money!!!", 
      "Like nifty c., I just do not understand the love. I've perhaps gone once for breakfast, and then two years later, once for lunch, and absolutely nothing I ate inspired me to return. In fact, I can't even remember what I've had there, it was so unmemorable. I'm guessing that I had at least the hash browns, because I am always in search of perfect hash browns, but I can make much better from freshly grated potatoes at home without the sinking feeling of disappointment to accompany them.", 
      "We hopped on over to the Courier Cafe on a Saturday night to get some ice cream sundae and more. The building is authentically old and the decor is pretty much 100 yrs old but very clean and interesting. The service was ok, the waiter forgot to get my drink. But thats ok, they were kind of busy I guess.The food was totally different scale ... I ordered the skinny dippers following recommendation of another yelper. The skinny dippers are just potato peals (dont mistake them for potato skins, the meatier kind) deep fried and topped with some veggies, cream etc. Its like a heart attack on a plate and the taste wasnt worth the extra grease on the plate.The sundae was blah, nothing to talk about. Very mediocre.Over all, if you are a drunk grad looking for a bite late night, this is the place for you."

      "As an Urbana native I grew up going to this place. I have always been satisfied and often recommend this to anyone new to the area. I really suggest going here and getting any number of the dishes as they are all great. The salad bar has a wide range of options which makes it one of the best in town. Leave room for dessert! The Misprint is definitely worth it.", 
      "Courier Cafe is a long time favorite place of mine to go in the Champaign-Urbana area. \u00a0The atmosphere can't be beat, the hometown old-fashioned feel is very warm and welcoming. \u00a0I love the look of it from the street with the lights framing the windows.The food has always been decent. \u00a0The Dagwood is especially good and the milkshakes are yummy. \u00a0The salad bar offers a nice selection as well.Definitely beats all the \"chain\" restaurants in town.", 
      "I would give this place a 3.5 stars. Their pastrami sandwich was good and the bread was very fresh but price was a little steep compared to their burgers. Their hand-dipped shake was awesome, so much better than Steak & Shake. They even gave us the extras in another cup. Great service too!", 
      "This is such a great place to go when you are sick of all of the places to eat on campus. \u00a0I think I loved this place from the moment I walked in and saw that they use the same chairs that my parent's have around their kitchen table. \u00a0The atmosphere is very homey. \u00a0So the food... \u00a0Obviously the shakes are amazing, but so are their sandwiches. \u00a0My favorite is the grilled swiss and pesto on sour dough with sweet potato fries. \u00a0They also have a big salad bar in the back and you pay for your salad by weight. \u00a0They have pretty interesting combinations and the price is just right.", 
      "i've had decidedly mixed experiences at courier. \u00a0my first time included being too loud and being rudely, but passive aggressively kicked out. \u00a0its a complication situation to get into, but i believe my good friend t.j. explains it all in his first review. \u00a0in any case, courier is a good place to go if you want to feel like your in a neighborhood place that is so established that sometimes the service might suck. and sometimes the food might suck. even the coffee might suck. \u00a0to couriers credit, when the food and drink doesnt suck its delicious. \u00a0but they have KILLER thick lovely milkshakes, and absolutely delicious chorizo topped potato skins always. \u00a0everything else is a hit or miss, but doesn't that just make the dining experience so much more fun? ok, i might be stretching it a little but i do love courier because i think at this point, i could not live without a little chocolate malt goodness in my life every once in a while. \u00a0what can i say? i'm hooked.", 
      "I went to Courier Cafe today with Mr. Boyfriend and two of our friends. Overall, we had a good experience.Pros:-Service: The cafe was fairly busy, but we were seated right away, and we all had water glasses within a couple minutes. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and very patient. If I could rate service separately, it would be a 5-star rating.-Decor: I like it! The theme seems to be old-timey newspaper, which is pretty cool. -Milkshake. Mr. Boyfriend and I got a peanut butter to split, and our friends got butterscotch. Awesome.-The \"Skinny Dippers,\" crispy, fried potato skins covered with cheese, bacon, sour cream and chives. These will make a person anything but skinny. We got a half-order to split, and ended up with approximately a bazillion potato skins. Wow.-Food in general: pretty good! -Menu: Quaintly themed, with desserts named after newspaper stuff (\"Headliner,\" \"Misprint,\" \"Cub Reporter,\" etc...). Standard American fare, sandwiches, burgers, etc.Cons, Almost-Cons, Slight Issues:-Price: It wasn't terribly overpriced for being right in downtown Urbana. I'm willing to pay $5.75 for a BLT. I just want the BLT to be a great BLT. The BLT was a good BLT, but it was a $4 BLT. Tiny slice of tomato, lots of lettuce, some decent bacon, on basic slices of wheat bread. The skins were $4.95, and these are SO worth it to split with a group, because of how good they are and how many we received. Milkshake was $3.75, I believe. Altogether, Mr. Boyfriend spent around $30 before tip for the two of us. -Timing: We arrived at 12:10, ordered by 12:15, and were served at 12:45. I had to be back at work by 1, so I had hoped the food would come out more quickly. This isn't a terrible wait, and like I said, the restaurant was doing good business. Still, I had ten minutes to eat, but 30 to talk. I would rather have 30 minutes to savor those potato skins, and ten minutes to talk to the jerks I call friends, but you can't always get what you want.", 
      "if you're a vegetarian, this place is super friendly. \u00a0breakfast offers tofu scramble instead of eggs, and vegetarian breakfast \"sausage\". \u00a0it's nice to have options instead of just having pancakes... again. \u00a0there is a nice salad bar, but to be honest, the quality of that is hit or miss. \u00a0sometimes it's really fresh and all the salads look like they have just been prepped, but sometimes, and it seems like it's been more often, the salad bar looks sad. \u00a0i actually got a scoop of slimy carrots the last time. \u00a0it was way gross, and it wasn't something i noticed until i had plopped the big scoop on my plate, thus ruining the rest of my salad. \u00a0they allowed me to take a new plate, and start again, but it was pretty gross. \u00a0if you like alternative proteins like beans and tofu, there is plenty on the bar. \u00a0however, the beans are just dumped from can to salad bar, and are full of that gelatinous goo that the beans float around in in the can. (you know... the stuff you usually rinse off thoroughly.)the service is generally fantastic. \u00a0a lot of their wait staff is attentive and friendly, especially in the morning. \u00a0there are some night staff that seem to forget you exist, but for the most part, it's decent service. \u00a0all in all, if your vegetarian or vegan, there are options, which is difficult to find for a sit down meal in this town and don't feel like having sushi or lo mein. \u00a0i would give it 4/5 but just because the quality of some things ... like service and salad bar... is hit or miss.", 
      "I came here yesterday for lunch with my brother. He got coffee and I got hot chocolate. Both came out quickly and tasted good. I got the turkey club sandwich and I added sprouts (which was an additional 75 cents? I thought that was just a tad too much) and the subtotal for my sandwich was then $8. I can't complain though because I saved the other half of the sandwich for dinner since the portions were pretty big. My brother went to the salad bar and it's only 32 cents per ounce, so his whole plate was less than $5! That was pretty awesome.", 
      "Good breakfast joint right in downtown Urbana.", 
      "Great atmosphere and great food! Love this place, always a favorite experience when visiting the area. I understand they close every year for 1 week for deep cleaning and general sprucing up (I make sure I don't visit the week after Christmas as to miss eating there.) Every restaurant should do this. I would always recommend The Courier Cafe!", 
      "Service: 5Food: 3Price: 1I decided to eat breakfast at Courier Cafe last week after reading all the good reviews. I ordered two eggs, sausage, potatoes, small fruit bowl and coffee. The waitress did an excellent job, looking over me just enough without being intrusive. The eggs, over easy, were too easy. The yolk was properly runny, but unfortunately so was the white. Sausages were tasty, but not seasoned enough. The hash browns were good, but could have been crisper. The English muffin that came with the meal was toasted well, but buttered too heavily. The total bill was $11.13, so plus the tip, my breakfast cost over $13.00. Next time I'll check the prices on the menu, I just assumed that they were in line with other breakfast eateries. I would give this place two stars if the service had not been excellent.", 
      "An absolutely wonderful experience. The atmosphere is quiet but bustling, with friendly staff and enthusiastic customers. Service was prompt, but not pushy. Their almond french toast is pure heaven. I will definitely be returning next time I am in town.", 
      "To be blunt, I'm baffled at the amount of love the burgers here received on Yelp. \u00a0Really just not that good. \u00a0The meat was dry and overcooked, the toppings were boring and it was pretty small. \u00a0The only reason this place received 3 stars from me was the OUTSTANDING soup! \u00a0The roasted corn and poblano chowder was absolutely delicious. \u00a0I wanted to stop by the nearest U of I frat house and borrow a beer bong to take down a vat of this soup--yea, it was that good! \u00a0Overall, the Courier Cafe just feels kind of old (kind of like the burgers taste), but, do yourself a favor and order a giant bowl of that soup!", 
      "I'd really been looking forward to going here. I'd passed it several times and was just looking for an occasion. Sunday morning brunch after V-day with the boy seemed like a good option. It was pretty hoppin and the inside was just what I expected it to be: very cute and eclectic, smattered with antiques (but not in the Cracker Barrel way.. in the authentic way), and cozy. Because the menus on the website don't say when breakfast ends and lunch begins, we weren't sure if we would have the option of choosing from either menu. We got there at around 11:35, and the hostess gave us menus with just breakfast. The menus are large, so if you take a while to decide (especially during brunch time...) be careful. Our waitress stopped by once immediately after we were seated to get our drink orders, and once about five minutes later. We told her we needed a few minutes. She came back shortly after and snapped at us, saying that they were only serving breakfast for 5 more minutes so we needed to order then. This was at around 11:45. I understand wanting to expedite things, but if the switch was happening at 11:50 shortly after we arrived, I think we should have been told by the waitress or the hostess that lunch was about to start (after we had been seated I saw people ahead of us getting salads and soups, but no lunch option was given to us). Anyway, he got the breakfast burrito and I got the breakfast sandwich. His was very good and enormous! The salsa verde was perfect.. I didn't even know I liked salsa on eggs. I think I just misordered in my haste. The croissant was not from their bakery.. it had the \"I came out of a cellophane wrapped plastic container from Sam's\" taste, but it was large.. just not a real croissant. The eggs were another problem: they were a consistent yellow color and had rounded borders. Not real scrambled eggs.. or maybe real but reconstituted. The bacon was tasty, the hashbrowns mushy. Not worth $7. He gave me half of his burrito in exchange for half of mine. I greatly benefited from the unfair trade! I really want to like this place, so I'll try it again in the next few weeks! Hopefully I'll get a smiley waitress. FYI: prices are a little higher than those listed on the online menu (but only about 50-60 cents).", 
      "The food is alright. Everything I've had has been decent, and they have a pretty good variety of sandwiches.What I really don't like, is that after waiting half an hour in the weekend-breakfast-rush, you finally get seated and are and offered two types of coffee: 'regular' coffee so weak and watery that you could reproduce it by pouring hot water into a coffee-stained pitcher, or hazelnut-vanilla-strawberry-mint-kiwi flavored 'coffee'. And they act so genuinely proud of themselves as they offer it to you. Its a marvel of human nature.", 
      "Always good for breakfast lunch or dinner. \u00a0Excellent salad bar.", 
      "I've never had anything really unique at the Courier Cafe, but everything I've eaten has been solid, steady, and delicious. \u00a0I just love getting off-campus for brunch, and indulging in food that tastes like it was made by someone's grandma. \u00a0When I visited campus last weekend, I went back for Sunday morning brunch, and enjoyed the Courier Breakfast - 2 eggs, 4 half-slices of toast, potatoes, and bacon. \u00a0Eggs were cooked perfectly, toast was brown and buttery, potatoes were addicting, and bacon was crisp. \u00a0Problem with that? \u00a0No. \u00a0It's nothing immensely creative or surprising, but I got exactly what I wanted and I enjoyed the atmosphere at the same time. \u00a0I'd always come back here for brunch.", 
      "Hands down the best milkshakes in Chambana. I love that they still have phosphates, and that they will mix milkshake flavors to your liking. This restaurant has been a go-to for me for the last four years in this town. All their burgers are a sure fire thing. Make sure you get em with a side of sweet potato chips. The service here has always been superb, and if you make it early enough for the breakfast menu, lucky you it's phenomenal.", 
      "Love this place, super delicious breakfast after an all nighter. Had the feta cheese omelette with wheat toast and the apple french toast (something like that). So good, mouth-wateringly good. Only reason I take off a star is because the server was a bit frantic and rude at first, but was relatively decent after our drinks. There was also an annoying group of high-schoolers there who reserved 30 spots...yeah....Nice atmosphere. Very antique/ vintage feel. Drinks are old-timey as well. They offer phosphates. Friend got a German chocolate cake coffee. Smelled exactly like it. Recommend this as an Urbana-must.", 
      "Courier is solid. \u00a0Come for the breakfast food, and if you're in need of a reliable lunch you should go to Courier as well. \u00a0It's nothing adventurous - eggs and bacon, pancakes, and tuna salad on white bread. \u00a0But it's tasty, reasonably priced, and friendly. It gets busy on weekends.", 
      "I've been here twice for breakfast and both times I've had a wonderful experience. The wait is never long and the waitresses are always very friendly. The coffee is a bit watered down but there's free refills so it is what it is. I personally really like the courier water (it's basically soda water) I've gotten the steak and eggs, pancakes and eggs, potato pancakes, and Corned beef before. Out of the 4 dishes, I would recommend the corned beef the most because it was something I've never tried and it was a good discovery. I like the potato pancakes at the original pancakes a little bit better. The parking lot provided by the restaurant was full the first time we came so we had to part across the street at the meters so that was a little bummer. Overall the food is okay but i really like the environment and the water. They have this really cool gum ball machine but it's kinda broken so you would have to ask the hostess for a gum ball. I know they have a salad bar that u pay by weight but I've never been here for lunch or dinner yet. I've seen people come here for desserts and shakes but perhaps another time", 
      "If you are in Champaign or Urbana, go to the Courier Cafe for breakfast/brunch. It was delicious and delightful. Their homemade breads were so satisfying. All of the breakfast dishes were standard but just had that home cooked feeling. I would eat their regularly if I lived there. Try the biscuits and gravy and try the sourdough bread.", 
      "YUM, we would trek it off campus to go here, it's the best place off campus for burgers and shakes. \u00a0The shakes are huge and they give you the silver cup too so it's like 2 shakes for the price of one! \u00a0Service was always really good, un-pretentious atmosphere.", 
      "I was really not that impressed with the food. I had a burger and it was ok. I ordered the sweet potatoe fries thinking they were fries but they are actually chips. I don't think I would go there again for the food.", 
      "This place is very good. \u00a0I like going for breakfast and lunch. \u00a0The best thing is their potato skins, which arent all that good for you, but the taste makes up for that really fast.", 
      "One of my favorite places to take guests from out-of-town. They make a mean milkshake for starters. Their burgers are great and they always taste great with their sweet potato fries (which I got serendipitously and have liked them eversince). I enjoy the decor and all of the fascinating objects in the building and I like how they provide a description of each memorable item on the back of the menu. The service is always been great and they always provide an excellent experience. The parking (east of the cafe) never is a problem so that is indeed another plus.", 
      "Corned Beef Hash and Eggs is the house specialty I'm told and it didn't disappoint. Also friendly house staff, you will always feel like family in this place. Just a quaint respite from the days travels ahead.", 
      "The Dagwood & mocha milkshakes are a couple of our favorites at Courier. Be forewarned, the Dagwood is huge (we split it)! They'll split your milkshake, too & its still a big portion. They're open late, so its a nice dessert spot.", 
      "Excellent food at lunch, good prices, \u00a0quick service, nice atmosphere. I'll be going back often.", 
      "Great place. \u00a0I breakfast here several times a week. \u00a0Staff is friendly and efficient. \u00a0My favorite waitress takes good care of me and took the time to get to know me and what I order. \u00a0The flavored coffee of the day is always quite good. \u00a0I tend to have the same thing each time because I like it but I have tried just about everything on the menu and it is always good. \u00a0The menu is not as large as some breakfast spots but there is enough variety for everyone to find something. \u00a0The corned beef breakfast, the cakes and eggs with buckwheats, and the Spanish omelet are particular favorites.", 
      "I love Courier Cafe's salad bar-it has absolutely everything you could ever put on a salad. \u00a0Salad bars aren't as popular or common as they were 30 years ago, but I am still a fan. \u00a0I've tried other things on their menu and enjoyed them-the desserts are excellent. \u00a0I like the Victorian decor, too.", 
      "Great almond french toast, decent coffee, but the place could use some sprucing up.", 
      "tried breakfast, and it gets an extra star. It's worth the wait for breakfast - pancakes are good.", 
      "Loved this place. \u00a0Flavored coffee, almond French toast and biscuits and gravy are all winners.", 
      "So far my lady and I have only been here for Ice Cream, but we will be returning for other meals. \u00a0As far as the Ice Cream goes, the best I've had in years! \u00a0The closest thing to a \"proper\" Ice Cream Parlor that I know of in the area.", 
      "The Courier mystifies me. \u00a0It's always packed. People say they love the food. They think the building is charming. But the decor seems more tired and limp than it does charming and authentic, and the place is very loud, and kind of dirty. \u00a0The menu looks like it has appetizing, if plain, selections, but the food doesn't taste like anything and there's so much of it on the plate that after a while you begin to feel as though you are in a fight to the death with it. \u00a0I've heard people say that it's diner food, but it tastes more like reheated frozen dinners. It looks like food, and sometimes it smells like food, but inexplicably, it doesn't taste like food. The service is serviceable. The bathrooms are appalling. \u00a0The salad bar is puzzling. \u00a0The four times I've been there, I've found it rather difficult to get cashed out. \u00a0After which, I've been surprised at how much cash I've just spent.", 
      "Love the atmosphere. An awesome place for getting into a great conversation with someone. The shake is very customizable, u can mix different flavors, you will find your favorite after some good digging and experimentation.", 
      "Best milkshakes in CU! They also have delicious lunches and dinners at affordable prices. However, besides the milkshakes, the Courier is best for breakfast, might I recommend the outmeal with fruit.", 
      "Second visit. \u00a0Is enjoyable I think due to the unique menu and the ambiance of the old newspaper office. Rueben and onion rings are good. Wife had the turkey club and both shared the potato skins appetizer. \u00a0All good and will go back as there appears many more items to try!!", 
      "Corn Beef & Pastrami with fries were gooooood good.They serve Green River soda. This place knows what's up.I'm not much of a deserts guy, but you have to get their banana split. Huge serving. Great vanilla taste."

      "Fucking fantastic. But I can't justify paying $5 bucks for a slice. Also everything tastes like it was loved with butter. Kinda gross. But also kinda delicious.", 
      "For our weekly pizza delivery, we decided to try something new and got Manolo's.We opted for the largest size thin crust with half pepperoni and half sausage. We also got 3 empanadas for $6 to go with it, delivery time was about an hour, which is to be expected on a weekend. This amount of food was just enough for our group of 3 in terms of portions.The pizza was decent, definitely better than a Papa John's or similar chain. I didn't think it was anything spectacular though. If you like thin crust, this might be for you. It reminded me of Sbarro, except a little better. My issue with this pizza, and perhaps all thin crust/New York style is the lack of sauce. The sauce is so key to the flavor that often times without it your just eating a cheesy breadstick. I might have liked it more if there was a bit more sauce. The pepperoni wasn't that good, however, the sausage was unusually good, it tasted fresh and wasn't just a mushy piece of nothing, great flavor! I think I will get sausage if I order again. The crust was good, crispy bottom but edible edges.Feedback on the empanadas was a unanimous OK. I can only personally speak for the cheesecake empanada. The filling didn't resemble something you could get at The Cheesecake Factory, but it also wasn't just dried goop. Not too bad! I think the empanadas might be a really good bargain if you got a lot of them and the price was around $1 each.I have not tried any of the specialty pizzas and I may have to do that and then update my review. I will also have to try The Empanadas House for a fair comparison.Overall we thought Manolo's was just OK, we thought it might have been just a little pricey, but we were not disappointed with our food.I'll be back!", 
      "Excellent Pizza, especially the spotted goat but all of them are good. Being Argentinian, however, I cannot approve of their empanadas. It's conveniently located next to the Music Library.", 
      "Great pizza, always consistent, a little too expensive in my opinion but I understand they use quality ingredients and you get what you pay for.", 
      "I've been going to Monolo's for a while now, and they're usually very consistent. Pizza by the slice is excellent and fairly portioned. The crust has a slight sourdough taste to it and the sauce and cheese is nicely balanced. As far as specialty slices go, BBQ Meats and Cuban Chicken are my favorites. Otherwise, plain cheese is good enough.I've had the empanadas, and they're also pretty good. Problem is, they're too expensive for what you get. More than $7 for three measly little pockets of meat/cheese/veggies is a bit much. I suppose the San Termo style empanadas warrant a try, but for the more standard varieties, I wouldn't bother. The specialty pizza slices are a bit pricey too.", 
      "I stopped here after a stats exam to eat my feelings in empanadas and pizza. I recommend the Spotted Goat pizza, it's crispy and delicious after being reheated to perfection. The empanadas are very mediocre. They are tiny, but have a very thick crust (0.5 to 0.7 cm). I prefer the empanadas from a new food truck called Empanada house, where the crust is about 2 mm thick and the filling isn't dry. I had to dock it 2 stars through because the price is just too damn high ($10+ for a slice of pizza and 2 empanadas). I suggest going to Canopy Club Monday night when they sell Manolo's slices for $1. Sure it's been out the whole day, but you can drown that remorse in $1 PBRs and the sweet sounds of amateur house music.", 
      "Second best pizza place in town. Its the only place that serves slices that's worth going to. Because its cheap and tasty, when we're stuck on campus, thats usually where we end up. I recommend the spotted goat pizza. We also get empanadas but those can get pricey if you order a lot. I was a little unimpressed with the dessert empanadas but the other flavors are good too!", 
      "Empanadas are pretty easy to make. You have your filling - usually some kind of meat, some spices, onions, make it the night before, stick it in the fridge - and you have your shells - usually made out of masa harina. When you're ready to serve them you plop a spoonful onto the shell, roll it up, squeeze the edges and drop them into the fryer.It's not haute cuisine. Every culture has some kind of dough-and-filling staple whether it be Polish pierogis or Chinese dumplings. It's so basic it's hard to believe anyone could fuck it up.Unfortunately, someone has. These are, by far, the worst dough-and-filling creations I've ever had. The dough was soggy, the filling was dry, it was paradoxically bland and salty. The mushrooms in the mushroom and cheese empanada tasted like they were on the verge of going bad. Also, they should be fried. Not baked. Granted, I ate the empanadas during Thanksgiving break when not many students are on campus so maybe the management didn't really think it'd be worth it to make fresh empanadas. Then again, empanadas should never be made hours beforehand to sit under a heat lamp. You want to save money? Close up shop instead of serving an inferior product.Finally, it was overpriced (3 little empanadas for 6 bucks) and the service was lousy. The place felt kind of disorganized and grimy, the employees were lackadaisical. I don't expect the corporate shine and whitewash of a Jimmy John's. A little dirt can be ok, I appreciate texture, but I also like a little bit more professionalism. If the owner wants to make some real money I'd say get rid of the pizza, get rid of all the empanda options except for maybe the top two flavors (a spicy ground pork one Colombian style and maybe a vegetarian option), reduce your staff, get an industrial deep fryer, drop the price of each empanada to $2, make it three for $5, offer free salsa to top on the empanadas and stay open really late on the weekends. Let the smell of the fried goodness waft over the street and watch people line up outside of your door. Empanadas are blue-collared, street food in Latin America. They're also great when you're drunk or high and got the munchies. This place should be so much better.", 
      "So you're sitting at the Canopy Club, maybe you're drinking a beer and watching the band and/or gawking at the scenery why not have a slice of pizza as well? The super slices are $1.75 for cheese, $2.20 for 1-topping and $2.75ish for specialty. The slices are a double slice, but they are thin, which is great if you like thin crust. They are excellent!", 
      "This is my favorite pizza place on campus, and my favorite specialty pizza to get anywhere ever. Every single time I order, I get a small Modena Chicken (chicken, onion, spinach, mozzarella, goat cheese, and a balsamic roasted garlic cream sauce) and finish it in one sitting. I'm always WAY too full after... but it's the kind of way too full that makes you want to lounge around and watch The Office instead of die/explode.For some reason, every time I describe that pizza to someone, the response is always \"Ewww, that sounds weird/gross,\" but I know someday I'll find someone that thinks it sounds as good as I do, and then we can order one to enjoy together... then get married. (Okay, maybe not get married, but we could hang out. And order more pizza.)Assuming you didn't eat a whole pizza and still have room for the dessert, the raspberry cheesecake empanada is a lovely finish.", 
      "Was all willing to give your over-priced super salty empanadas another shot at glory, man.But when called recently, over an HOUR past your stated open, no one picked up. \u00a0I've worked pizza and deli places; know how it can be. \u00a0Tried four more times to get through.Screw you, Manolos, we are so over. \u00a0Don't come crawling back next week with your lame excuses.", 
      "Best choice of ingredients and selection of toppings I've seen in a pizza joint. Spotted goat is great but what's really great about this place is a vegan actually has options on this menu.", 
      "An east coast transplant to the midwest has trouble adjusting in the realm of pizza. \u00a0Deep dish is its own animal, so I won't diss it because I enjoy it. \u00a0Then there are your chain restaurants that produce a very doughy pizza that I'm okay with, but it's not what I love. \u00a0Some places around here claim they do \"thin crust\". \u00a0Rosati's, Monical's, even Dominoes has attempted the \"thin crust\", but they basically make pizza cracker. But then there's Manolo's! \u00a0Their pizza is reminiscent of what I remember as thin crust. \u00a0If you're from New England, I guess you would understand if I said their pizza reminded me of Papa Gino's. \u00a0A little greasy, but overall a delicious slice. \u00a0Their specialty pizzas are also very good. \u00a0Got the Spotted Goat (spinach, mushroom, mozzerella, gorgonzola, goat cheese, roasted garlic alfredo sauce and red sauce). \u00a0Fantastic. \u00a0If you're looking for a \"NY/Boston\" style thin crust pizza... you'll appreciate Manolo's. \u00a0It's not home for sure, but it does the trick.", 
      "It is a rare day when I actually have BAD pizza. \u00a0I've had mediocre, I've had unexciting, but the other night I actually got a BAD pizza delivered. \u00a0In addition, this was a late night after-drinks affair, so I really wasn't picky. \u00a0The crust was so rubbery, I had trouble biting through it. \u00a0This was a plain cheese pizza. \u00a0I was very hungry, but I couldn't get through more than one piece. \u00a0Not only that, but it came to like $18 for it. \u00a0There were cheaper options, but I figured I'd try something new. \u00a0I know better now.", 
      "Really good, floppy pizza.. Massive slices, freshly heated, and lots of specialty varieties with tons of imaginative toppings (goat cheese is my hero!) \u00a0The bottom is crispy without being crunchy, and everything tastes great.I tried both the vegetarian pizza and the Modena veggie (the one with mushrooms and goat cheese)... The Modena was definitely the standout, but again, I would trust goat cheese with my firstborn. And all of my offspring after that.I also tried one of their empanadas, which I can't really review because I wanted the vegetarian version of their Argentinian spiced one, but I may have accidentally had a meaty one. \u00a0My mom ordered their spinach and ricotta empanada, but when she bit into hers, it looked like it had some kind of soy meat or real meat. Hard to tell, and I don't want to think about it too much! All I know is they definitely gave us one meaty empanada when we ordered two vegetarian ones-- major problem!!They also had a lot of problems charging our credit card. They tried three times, and we got all these fraud alerts afterward.BUT they were running a deal where you got a free medium cheese pizza when you spent $10... And they gave us two! (We did spend over $40).My brother was really excited to share this place with us, and he doesn't get excited about too much food-wise, so that of course made the whole experience a full star better!", 
      "I actually really enjoy the food here, but the service is hit or miss. Usually, the owner is very respectful and quick to serve his customers. However, upon going to the restaurant with a friend last year, there was no one at the register but several workers loitering around in the back. Starving, I started to glare at them, getting impatient for proper service. When they caught my incredulous stare, they instead interpreted my anger as attraction. Seriously. One let out a guffaw and snorted, \"Look, [person B], that Korean girl is checking you out. Hahahaha...\" First of all, I'm Chinese American. If you're going to judge my ethnicity, at least get it right. Second of all, who treats a paying customer like a gawking idiot like they did? I almost wanted to throw the empanadas I bought back in the cashier's face. But I like the empanadas, and it would be such a waste left on such horrible cashiers.Basically, be careful when ordering if you happen to be an Asian American female. Some of the ridiculous workers will interpret your glare as flattery to their already blown up egos.", 
      "Isn't it nice when a place redeems themselves?After walking in to grab a slice, Manolo's has been a much better food/service experience.The pizzas by the slice are on display, and you should always ask what's in the oven to round out your choices. I don't think there's too much of a difference of a pizza coming out fresh or them putting one of the slices on display back in the pizza oven to re-crisp/melt when you order.Only issue I have with Manolo's is that recently they have been underestimating the amount and types of pizzas they have on display. If you are in the area, try their new goat cheese pizza or any of the full loaded \"supreme\" type options.I don't think the empanadas are worth it still.. little bastards are too expensive to justify stuffing my face with.", 
      "Two pizza places arrived in this area of Urbana recently- Rosati's and Manolo's. While I haven't eaten through the amazing range of items Manolo's offers, I am confident Manolo's is the best of the two.Pizza places are ubiquitous on college campuses, so I'm never too excited when one springs up. Manolos sets itself apart by having empandas, which are an excellent alternative to pizza. They have several types ranging from the more authentic spicy San Telmo Carne to flaming potato. The three types I tried were tasty and the pastry was puffy and soft. They are perfect for an on-the-go snack since they can easily be eaten while walking.As for the pizza? The cheese pizza I tried was good and had a nice crust. \u00a0Hands down the best pizza there (and the reason for the recently added extra star) is the fresh basil and mozzarella. I had it with some friends and we all agreed it was top-notch. It's fragrant from the very fresh basil and the cheese stands out as being so much better than regular pizza cheese. Specialty pizzas are a little bizarre. The one I tried, creamy chicken gorgonzola, was sans red sauce. It wasn't bad, but it was like some cheese, chicken, spinach, and (good) portabellas on dough. More like upscale breadsticks than pizza. Make sure the description says it has red sauce if you are looking for something traditional. Ditto the other reviewer- They make their food! Surprisingly enough, this is actually unusual. Many restaurants buy pre-made items from big companies, but here at Manolos you can see them rolling the dough for all the pizza and empanadas.Delivery is slow and expensive. Pick up is the better option.", 
      "I've only had the empanadas. \u00a02/3 of them were good. \u00a01/3 was terrible.I have to admit I think their pricing for empanadas is surprisingly overpriced. \u00a0I had them while visiting a friend at the University who just moved there from New York. \u00a0In New York he practically lived on empanadas, which were delicious, easy to find and cheap. \u00a02 out of three of the varieties I had at Manolo's could survive in New York based on flavor, but none of them would survive at the prices Manolo's charges. \u00a0When you're in the middle of corn country and you're outpricing New York, something's gone horribly wrong.", 
      "I love the idea pizza and empanadas, two of the best foods ever. However, the empanadas weren't so good. In one word; soggy. I like my empanadas freshly fried, little bundles of goodness wrapped in a crispy shell of deliciousness. I should have known when the nadas were sitting in a display case under a heat lamp.You get 2 instead of 1, because the guys working there were nice. If I get hungry I might try the pizza and reevaluate.", 
      "Depending on what time you get there (or whether you get it delivered), the empanadas can sometimes be dry or soggy. \u00a0The fillings are usually really good, and creative, but the shell is usually kind of disappointing.I tried the pizza once, and wasn't impressed. \u00a0It was just kind of thin and ominous. \u00a0It sat under a heat lamp with the empanadas.A teensy bit pricey, as well.", 
      "I had the San Telmo pollo, potato cheddar, and chocolate brownie empanadas. They were good, but very small and a little expensive for what they are. Maybe next time I'll try the pizza.", 
      "I am across the country and cannot believe how much I miss Manolo's Pizza and Empanadas!Empanadas:So many choices and vegetarian friendly! My favorites are the pepperoni pizza and bean and cheese. Stay away from the mushroom and thyme, I thought it was awful. I haven't tried their dessert empanadas: brownie and cheesecake. The san telmo anything is okay if you want more of \"meat and veggie\" taste.Pizza:The BBQ Meats pizza is why I can never become vegetarian! Imagine a super thin pizza crust where BBQ sauce substitutes marinara sauce. Then add chicken, bacon, ground beef, pepperoni and sausage. Mmmmmm....You had me at bacon.I've also enjoyed their other specialty slices.I also have to give credit to Manolo's for having great pizza crust. The thinness of it toasts so well in the pizza oven that you have to hold yourself back from inhaling the entire slice in five minutes.Ambiance:Limited indoor seating and a few outdoor seats when the weather is nice. I suggest taking your food and sitting in the Krannert outdoor theater.", 
      "Ah, Manolo's. My office used to be some 500 feet from this little place, and I ate lunch there literally every day. I've never had the empanadas because I've never seen the need. The pepperoni pizza is fantastic, the cheese is pretty good and the specialty slices are great- I recommend the apple butter and bacon.The staff is also wonderful- though coming in every day for a year probably helped- and I really should go more often now that I've moved. Pizza is really cheap- at $4 for a specialty slice, you can really save money on lunch costs (not as much as bringing it from home, but I'm lazy).", 
      "Love to get their pizza by the slice at Canopy Club. It is in the style of New York pizza (but I am not saying its New York pizza, so settle down, Mario). They take a slice from the carousel on the bar and stick it in the oven for a minute or so. Take a look at what is on the carousel before you order to make sure it looks good and not all orange/cancer bubbly or burnt. They also have parm cheese, red pepper, and hot sauce. I guess it is probably not 4 stars good, but there really is nothing like booze and pizza in a music venue that often smells rather strongly of *ahem* the perennial accoutrement of musicians. Kind of like how a nice afternoon at Wrigley makes Old Style taste like truffle butter infused ambrosia.", 
      "of all the empanadas i tried (i got the after 10pm 6 for $9 deal), the only one that really didn't work for me was the pizza pepperoni one. \u00a0Pepperoni is meant to be eaten as garnish, not as a main ingredient.And yes, i ate all 6 in one sitting -- partly because i hadn't eaten all day and because my hotel room didn't have a microwave.", 
      "Edited after getting a whole pizza for take-out. \u00a0It was the Chicken Carbonara and it \u00a0was magical. \u00a0The veggies tasted fresh sliced, the bacon was crispy, and there were big chunks of chicken. \u00a0It was one of the best pizzas I've had. \u00a0Not super cheap for a pizza at about $18 but so, so good.So some of the best pizzas are the specialty ones on the menu, and not just the ready-made ones under the heat lamps. \u00a0So now I say: 5 stars for the pizza, 3 for the empanadas.The pizza is - for my money - the best of its kind on campus, and certainly the best within an easy walk from the quad. \u00a0The prices per slice seemed a little high until I went to Sbarro and got a much more disappointing slice for more money. \u00a0I won't do that again.Here they usually have the traditional pizzas - cheese, sausage, pepperoni - but the standouts are their more unusual toppings. \u00a0My other favorite is the hungry goat, which has tomato, basil, mushrooms, and goat cheese. \u00a0A little bit of hot sauce from the counter and you have the perfect greasy mid-day snack. \u00a0There are other interesting options that seem to rotate - a potato pizza, a mushroom pizza, a Mexican themed pizza, and the supreme are the ones I remember from last time. \u00a0I've also seen apple butter pizza and the barbecue meats, which is good stuff.The pizza slices are about 10 inches long and 4.5 wide. \u00a0It's a more floppy, chewy pizza. \u00a0The cheeses and toppings vary, and it's usually a little greasy - though of course, it depends on what type you get. \u00a0When you order it goes in the oven to warm up.The empanadas are okay but leave me more hungry than the pizza. \u00a0I am not that great a fan of empanadas, though. \u00a0I didn't notice a huge difference between the different fillings. \u00a0I haven't tried the dessert ones, but I am told they are good.Convenient and consistently pretty good.", 
      "Best pizza in Champaign-Urbana in my opinion. The unique flavor mashups are some you won't find anywhere, and they work to perfection. Also, the empanadas are out of this world. Also with flavor variations you don't get that frequently. I wish this place was more sit-down at times, but that could take away from its main focus: the food. The only drawback I have is that the delivery takes a long time.", 
      "This is a tough review to write because I absolutely LOVE their BBQ meats pizza slices, but every other slice of pizza I've ever had there was an absolute waste of money, and considering the fact you'll spend over $4/slice it's definitely not worth getting anything other than the BBQ meats pizza. Some of the empanadas are pretty nice but also vastly overpriced. I go there every now-and-again for the BBQ meats pizza but refuse to spend my hard-earned money on anything else!", 
      "Pretty wonderful, actually. I'm not and have never been the biggest fan of pizza, but when I'm in this area of town Manolo's is the place I like to go. They have good, huge slices (the Spotted Goat is about the best thing ever) and tasty empanadas (I like the chicken + jalapeno, with sour cream for dippin'). The place is tiny, with four or five stools at a counter and a couple of spots outside. This being campus there is almost always someone extremely irritating in line with you, but whatever. If you're coming here you're just looking for good food on the cheap, not a fine dining experience.", 
      "Best pizza in the area. \u00a0Not quite as good as what I grew up on, but really close. \u00a0The empanadas are pretty good too!I only wish their delivery area was a little wider, I live just outside of it.", 
      "Pretty good place to grab a quick bite to eat between classes. Liked their pizza and was inexpensive. \u00a0The staff seemed sincere and nice asking twice if I wanted a box for my pizza or a plate this is unusual in champaign and I appreciated their general interest in my eating preferences.", 
      "To be fair, I do know the folks that run this place. \u00a0BUT -- I would love Manolo's anyway. \u00a0I think they have a creative menu -- not standard ingredients in their empanadas and pizza. \u00a0Very large pizza slices, and they always make it fresh. \u00a0You can buy their stuff when you are in the Canopy Club, too. \u00a0I've turned several people on to this place and I truly miss it now that I'm gone. \u00a0I think it is really affordable and a nice change to the usual pizza and campus food scene.", 
      "Wow, arguably the WORST pizza I've ever had and they completely screwed up our order. \u00a0NO THANKS.", 
      "When this place started, it seemed overpriced but the food was OK, especially the empanadas, which could be nice. Nowadays it is just inedible. Low quality ingredients, a TON of salt (not just salty, insanely salty, are they actually trying to put people in the hospital?). A certain empanada with herbs (thyme and such) had ingredients which were actually evidently expired and tasted so bad that I had to spit my food out. Pizza tastes much better even at a place like Papa John, not exactly gourmet food. Overpriced garbage. Never again.", 
      "Great pizza by the slice, and a bargain too. \u00a0All of them are in the $2-3 range, and are large. \u00a0Carry-out only, though there are some tables outside. \u00a0I really like the crust, and the sauce/cheese combination is to my liking. \u00a0I much prefer it to Rosati's around the corner, which costs at least twice as much and takes more than twice as long to prepare! \u00a0Have eaten here too much, esp. since I am in the School of Music!", 
      "Now that we have Manolo's in addition to Drew's and other pizza joints, the pizza market in C-U is getting a little saturated. Meaning, the food scene in Champaign is getting a little boring. But what sets Manolo's apart is actually their empanadas. You should feel happy because these people actually make empanadas from scratch instead of getting them from vendors. The crust is always flaky and consistent. I highly recommend their carne and mushroom empanadas. I think their empanadas are a little pricey for the size but it's worth paying for their extra effort of making food from scratch.", 
      "Hands down one of my favorite pizza places in C-U. Love the specialty pies and their occasional \"slice du jour\" (had a thanksgiving dinner one once! SO GOOD). Never have ordered a whole pizza, as their prices are a lot higher than most places, but their slices are definitely worth $4. Absolute favorite? Apple Butter Bacon! You pretty much can't go wrong, as they list all of the ingredients next to the pizzas they have made. Empanadas are also delicious, but the slices are where it's at for me. \u00a0Should definitely stop here if you're visiting town and try a slice.", 
      "The closest thing you'll get to New York style pizza in the area. \u00a0 I've lived in NY my whole life and was really missing NY pizza out here in the midwest (tons of places advertise NY pizza but it's all wrong).Their desert empanadas are great too", 
      "I eat here at least once a week and have for the past two years. \u00a0I have always found the empanadas moist and good, if a tad salty. \u00a0Pizza is the most gourmet to be found in Champaign OR Urbana. \u00a0Far and away the best food option in the Nevada Street part of campus. \u00a0If I didn't feel the need to consume vegetables now and again I would eat there even more often."

      "Really nice place. A real hidden gem. We decided to go out for some wine last night, and chose this place because it was so close to our home. We were pleasantly surprised! The atmosphere is great and the staff are very knowledgable and nice. I didn't eat, but plan on going back for the food!", 
      "I would say this is an okay liquor store. They seem to have a variety of wines & beer on hand. However, they lack a decent variety of hard liquor. Also, I find them to be quite expensive. I prefer Binnys.", 
      "Phenomenal food, service, and atmosphere. The blackened chicken sandwich and baked potato salad was ridiculously good. \u00a0Can't wait to go back.", 
      "Great place for wine and cheese! Friendly people, delicious assortment of cheeses, deli food and wines. The atmosphere is very casual as it is set in the center of a strip mall. \u00a0This is a mix of wine/beer store and deli. \u00a0There are several tables and a bar inside as well as tables out front on the patio. \u00a0The menu is very extensive with a variety of wines, beers and spirits to choose from as well as soups, salads and sandwiches. \u00a0The food was very good, presented well and reasonably priced. In the store area you will find a nice variety of wines and beers to take home with you.", 
      "I've been here several times and keep coming back for the delicious menu and wine selections. \u00a0After tonight, I won't be returning. \u00a0The service was awful. \u00a0When I inquired about ordering dessert, the staff in the deli department rudely informed me that I can get a menu from my server. \u00a0 A full hour before closing, the staff began mopping the floors, throwing garbage around, and making a lot of noise. \u00a0We got the message loud and clear and won't be back.", 
      "I could write a long review, but it's not necessary. This place is simply the best.", 
      "Wow!! \u00a0There are a lot of good reviews for this place. \u00a0Maybe I am missing something. \u00a0Went here for lunch today and ordered the special which was a caprese sandwich & broccoli cheese soup. \u00a0They both tasted just fine. \u00a0In fact I thought the sandwich was quite tasty. \u00a0But I left hungry. \u00a0That was the smallest sandwich I think I have ever had. \u00a0It was about the size of one of those little finger sandwiches you get served on a platter by someone walking by at a party. \u00a02 or 3 bites and it's over.The soup was good but again very small portion. \u00a0The real kicker was the bill. \u00a0$11.00 for a couple of bites. \u00a0Friar Tuck has \u00a0a better wine selection too.Not sure if I would go back for a second try.", 
      "So happy I finally tried this place! I have to agree that the almond crusted goat cheese salad was delicious! I had it with the chicken tortilla soup, also very tasty, paired with the Kris Pinot Grigio. Pleasant, friendly, and knowledgeable staff. It was my first visit and I will definitely be back.", 
      "Always a win! \u00a0Love the vibe, selection and attitude! \u00a0 Champaign's gem of a hangout. \u00a0Love Mark and Jackie!", 
      "This is a great place for lunch.. Great wine and the sandwiches are fantastic. This place is also a good place to shop for wine and kitchen accessories.Thanks.", 
      "Wow.Sunsinger was a very pleasant surprise. \u00a0I wasn't expecting much from a sandwich cafe in a wine store, but the food here was absolutely fabulous. \u00a0The cheese experience was wonderfully presented and a great way to start off the evening. \u00a0We had the two cheese plate and it was a perfect appetizer; four and it would've been a lovely meal.My husband raved about the beef and mushroom sandwich he ordered, and I couldn't have been happier with my gourmet grilled cheese. \u00a0I adore sweet/savoy dishes, and the rich buttery challa, creamy melted cheeses, sweet fig jam and tangy apple slices were really a winning combination.We ordered the chocolate love cake for dessert, and it was a bit much for us. \u00a0The cake was so rich that even splitting it, we were definitely pushing the envelope to finish it off. \u00a0It was, however, delicious and a very small piece would have been perfect.The service was friendly and attentive and the cafe area had a very nice cozy feeling. \u00a0We wandered around the store checking out the wine selection and cheese counter after our meal. \u00a0Had I not just consumed enough cheese to sink a ship, I would have done some serious damage to my grocery budget! \u00a0Dinner itself wasn't cheap considering it was sandwiches, but it was clear that the ingredients were top quality and well worth the price.", 
      "Sunsinger is definitely one of the treats of the CU area. It has a great atmosphere, delicious food and, overall, a friendly staff. I've been there many times since a friend turned me onto it and the food has always been delicious. The almond-crusted goat cheese salad is one of my favorite menu items. It has one of the best balsamic dressings I've ever tasted and the combination of almonds, warm goat cheese, dressing and the crunchy salad is perfect. Also try the grilled cheese with apple slices and fig jam inside. You'll be glad you did.I've had a few cheese plates and their selection of cheese spreads and have been impressed every time. When they have special selections of cheeses they are always well-selected and make for a fun lunch or dinner as they usually range from the more mild to the more adventurously pungent.If I have one complaint, it's that the service is slow. There is a very relaxed atmosphere in general there and as long as you leave yourself plenty of time you'll have an enjoyable time. I would not recommend going there if you're in a hurry though. They're staff seems fairly small no matter how busy they are and everything comes to your table at a leisurely pace. If you have an hour for lunch or are not on your way to a movie after dinner though, you should be fine.After you're done, be sure to check out the wine selection. The staff is incredibly helpful in selecting a good wine and will not judge you if you don't know a great deal about wines in general. I've went with a staff member's recommendation on a couple occasions and have yet to be disappointed.", 
      "Sun Singer is definitely a rare find in the area, especially when you're tired of the campus restaurants on Green St. \u00a0I came here for to celebrate my friend's graduation and this place was divine. \u00a0The layout is not exactly fitting for large groups and our party had to push several tables together, but the staff was very accommodating and the ambiance is great for conversation.The restaurant/cafe is inside a winery and is perfect for a casual lunch. \u00a0They have a deli section with fine cheese and meats. \u00a0I felt like I was transported to Europe and wish I could take a 3 hour lunch-break just to enjoy it all.... The first thing people told me to get was the LOBSTER BISQUE. \u00a0And believe me, this is the best! \u00a0It was so creamy, thick, and full of lobster flavor and goes well with any of their sandwiches. \u00a0I got their grilled cheese supreme with 2 amazing cheeses (Danish Fontina & Fiscalini Cheddar), granny smith apples and fig jam on challah bread. \u00a0You'd never think jam would ever go so well in a cheese sandwich, but it does! \u00a0A half sandwich and cup of soup is $9.75.Their sandwiches some with some olives, fried vegetable crisps and mini pickles. \u00a0I have yet to try the rest of their extensive menu but their food is well worth the price.", 
      "Sun Singer just warms my heart.Some people seem to balk at the idea of a fantastic eatery existing inside a wine shop, but it's really ideal--you should have no qualms about having wine with your early lunch, trying a few glasses, and walking out with your favorite bottle! \u00a0The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the food is fantastic. \u00a0It's the perfect place to grab a classy lunch.", 
      "I had heard that this place serves gourmet food. \u00a0Unfortunately, it is in no ways trendy. \u00a0It just seems like a cute place to have brunch.. and the crowd is a bit older. \u00a0It's not really expensive.. but it's a little pricey for sandwiches. \u00a0It's a little ways of a drive from campus or downtown.. but the food is good. \u00a0Service is a little lacking. \u00a0You have to flag down the waiter for menus, more water, etc.I tried their lobster bisque and thought it was pretty good. \u00a0I also liked the smoked salmon-goat cheese sandwich. \u00a0I tried my friend's reuben and thought it was AWESOME.It also seemed to have a good selection of international wines and other products (sodas, etc.). \u00a0I personally think that Friar Tuck's is better though for buying alcohol.", 
      "I was pleasantly surprised when my friends brought me to this cute little place. \u00a0Who'd have thought this cool, tiny wine bar and store would exist in a strip mall in Champaign, IL?Healthy pours from the bartender. \u00a0And the menu, while limited, is perfect for nibbling, chatting and wine sipping. \u00a0We split a couple of appetizers, with the cheese platter filled with our wonderfully stinky choices, the star.Nice selection of wines to purchase also.", 
      "Best top shelf liquor selection I think in champaign, with a nice variety of wine bottles and many, many shelves of imports and microbrews. \u00a0The deli is great if you need a simple brie or some salmon spread, but doesn't have the selection that ye olde time meat and deli shoppe does for meats, or EuroMart for cheeses. \u00a0Plan ahead if you need to visit the deli at the last minute for cheese for a party, it is sloooowwwwwwww and invariably takes longer than I think it's going to, causing me to be late.", 
      "I had no idea this place existed until very recently, and now I can't wait to come back to try all their different wines and menu items.True, the location leaves something to be desired, but I think it's worth the trip. \u00a0Here, they have a wide variety of wines (so much so, that even my wine-savvy friend hadn't heard of several of their selections), and a surprisingly extensive menu for a deli-esque kitchen.We split a cheese plate and a hummus plate. \u00a0The cheese plate was okay... the cheeses weren't overly exotic or special, but the black-bean hummus they had was really really good. \u00a0The taste of it lingered in my mouth for quite some time afterwards.Our total bill came out to around $60, but that also included.... let's seee...... 6 glasses of wine?Not somewhere I would come everyday, but a nice treat every once in awhile. \u00a0They have outdoor seating as well.The other half of Sunsinger was basically a cellar where they carried a wide variety of wines, liquors, etc. \u00a0For the most part, I think these wines were priced a little higher than one would typically find elsewhere, but I'm not wine connoisseur, so don't quote me on that.If you have the opportunity, give Sunsinger a try.", 
      "Hands down favorite place for a casual dinner and drinks in Champaign.It's laid back and casual (but still cool!). \u00a0It's a wine bar, so of course I love it. \u00a0But they also have really good sandwiches, cheese platters, and appetizers.Relatively inexpensive as well.", 
      "I want to give you 4 stars, sun singer... But the service is painfully slow, especially with so many waiters standing around idly (why are you texting at work?). Fix that and I'll give the 4th star back. Nonetheless, my greek salad today was wonderful. The greens were perfect, the onions were sliced ever-so-thinly and the dressing was atypical in a good way for a greek salad (kind of pesto reminiscent.) They could have done a little better at designing the place into a dual-purpose venue. It looks too much like we're eating in a grocery store.", 
      "As you walk in, all the wine and spirits are displayed in front of you. As you turn to the left you will see a nice little bar with some tables and the deli behind that. The beer selection is towards the back of the wine. \u00a0The bar/cafe area is really nice and welcoming. \u00a0They have a good selection of all things. \u00a0Extensive wine selection and a very good rotating beer selection. \u00a0Good micro options like Bells, or some imports as well. \u00a0You can sample wine, or pick a beer and they will chill that so you can enjoy for your meal. \u00a0The food is really good. \u00a0Lots of sandwiches, soups, salads, meat and cheese plates, as well as a few small plates. \u00a0A good Reuben, Roast Beef, and any other sandwich that happens to be available. \u00a0Sauteed mushrooms as a side is great. \u00a0You can also get beer, wine, and any other deli options to go. \u00a0I really like the place.", 
      "Really great food, and a nice (though pricey) alcohol selection. \u00a0The encrusted goat cheese salad is delicious, and the mushroom soup on Tuesdays is TDF. \u00a0Diet blasphemy, but TDF.", 
      "Disappointed with our (1st) experience tonight. Came in to have a few drinks and maybe dinner. Wanted to sit at the bar, got the last two seats. The young man behind the bar was busy talking to a young woman, when finished he didn't welcome us, threw two menus down and walked away. He seemed very uninterested in waiting on us. I noticed everyone around us had nice full glasses of wine, ours were tiny. We got the hint, we left and don't plan on returning. I guess we didn't look like the regulars but were ready to spend a nice night and plenty of money.", 
      "What a nice surprise!We went last night because it was warm and we wanted to sit outside and have a drink and some dinner. I got the 1/2 Bavarian Pretzel sandwich with ham and swiss with chicken enchilada soup and my husband got the Smoked Salmon Club (he called it a salmon BLT) with a side of beets. I was really happy with my choice. He REALLY liked his, too. We browsed in the store and they have such a wide selection! Their deli cheeses look amazing. The choices of beer is practically endless and they have some FINE liquors. I had a lot of fun browsing. The only downside to Sun Singer is that it is a bit pricey, but the quality is worth it.", 
      "Very tasty! \u00a0I love this place and I don't even drink wine! \u00a0I concur, order the gourmet grilled cheese! \u00a0For standard lunch fare (Sandwiches, soups and salads), the prices are a little high. \u00a0My husband's half Hot Dutch was TINY, dwarfed by his half Caesar salad. \u00a0My half gourmet grilled cheese was a little on the small side but nearly as small and my cup of dill cucumber soup was just enough-and so refreshing! \u00a0Our started of pretzel sticks seemed like they were frozen and reheated in the oven, not exactly homemade, but the dip that came with them was tasty. \u00a0 Service was very good, attentive servers and friendly manager. I also love their deli counter, they make a mean cheese spread!", 
      "I got the grilled cheese w/ apple and figs that other reviewers raved about and the lobster bisque. The sweet and salty flavor of the sandwich was unique and definitely delicious! The bisque was very flavorful too. But I was definitely not pleased with the price or the portion size. I really want to give this place just 3 stars because they are so overpriced but then again so is everything else in C-U. People that live around here must be used to over paying on food to think these prices are reasonable.So I will give back one star because the service was pretty attentive (before it got busier in there) and the place was clean, cozy, and charming. I'd go back only because the food is good and because I'm starting to get used to the fact that restaurants in C-U really are more over-priced than anywhere else I've eaten in the world.", 
      "This is the deli that isn't.The food and wine are good, as described by other reviewers but the take-out food ordering system is among the most bizarre I've ever experienced. Apparently the restaurant and retail foods systems run on different computer systems, so to order prepared food to take out....you have to order in the restaurant or at the front counter, then go back to get your food and the \"deli\" staff (who speak poor English) have no idea about your order until it surfaces on their paper printout. \u00a0I've been in restaurants, takeouts and delis everywhere and have never seen such poor coordination, even when orders are simply shouted.In a city that is overrun with restaurants and takeout places, you'd think that the owners could somehow get past this and create a real working deli - something the immediate area needs badly (the other sandwich shop in the mall is pretty poor). \u00a0The lunch rush could be huge for the place, but apparently they're not interested in more business in a brutally competitive restaurant market.My two stars worth.", 
      "Very cool lunch place. I had the half sandwich and salad combo. I had the portobello mushroom sandwich and the goat cheese salad and they were very good. There were also cheese plate options that I would love to go back and try. This is also a good spot for gifts for wine lovers/people that entertain. There was outside seating and seating at the bar. My only gripe was that the service was a tad bit slow but it may have been because I was sitting at the bar. I can see how people may say the food is pricey but it is worth it for the better quality. The portobello sandwich was a good vegetarian option, and the grilled cheese sandwich also looks like a great option, I want to go back and try that also!", 
      "Normally a good place to go, however when I wait at a table for over five minutes and there are four waiters wondering around and not acknowledging me, I walk out. Shameful service", 
      "This review is late in coming. \u00a0I went to Sun Singer not long after it opened. \u00a0I ordered a platter of food that was supposed to feed four. \u00a0There was barely enough to feed two. \u00a0Then I ordered a bottle of wine off their menu. \u00a0OFF THEIR MENU!! \u00a0I did not bring my own and did not buy a special bottle off their shelf, but bought one off their menu and was charged a corkage fee. \u00a0WHAT?!?! \u00a0I \"discussed\" this with the manager and was told this was the policy. \u00a0He was dismissive and arrogant about it, talking as if I knew nothing about the concept of a corkage fee. \u00a0That was the first, last, and only time I ever set foot in that place.", 
      "This is my new favorite place. \u00a0The wait staff (as well as wine clerks) are knowledgable and friendly. \u00a0I was visiting the cafe this time and was pleasantly surprised at the reasonable prices. \u00a0I ordered a \"sunsinger cheese experience\" for $7.99 (or maybe it was $6.99, I can't remember) which included 2 wonderful chunks of cheese (and a little knife to slice them), delicious fresh sliced bread, lots of fresh fruit including grapes, apples, dried cranberries and sugared, dried mango all beautifully presented on a big plate. \u00a0 It was so lovely. \u00a0And I ordered a nice glass of wine for $5.50. \u00a0It was great and the waitress was \"johnny on the spot\" refilling my friends' water glasses and getting their orders. \u00a0A great experience.", 
      "Sun Singer has the best wine selection when you don't want to buy at a warehouse and you want expert recommendations. I can go there when I'm about to entertain my \"wine friends\" and get great wine that won't break the bank or I can ask for two buck chuck that won't embarrass me for my \"I know nothing about wine\" friends. The staff is really friendly and it's a good place to sit outside in jeans and a t-shirt without dealing with a downtown scene.", 
      "I found this place while searching for an alternative to all the chain restaurants in town (my mom was visiting and hates eating somewhere she can go to in Chicago). \u00a0This is a unique-to-Champaign place for sure, so it seemed promising. \u00a0In concept, the place is great. \u00a0Cute little cafe/ wine bar in conjunction with a wine and cheese and specialty food shop. \u00a0They need to do a better job in the cafe area, in my opinion. \u00a0The menu was interesting, but the prices were a little high. \u00a0 When our food arrived, we noticed right away how small the portion sizes were. \u00a0I actually appreciate when restaurants have reasonable portion sizes, but these were on the small side of reasonable. \u00a0Neither of us felt full at the end of the meal, and for the price of the meal, we felt a little ripped off. \u00a0 The food was good, we had the chicken salad sandwich and the gourmet grilled cheese.", 
      "Since I'm 14 days too young to drink, I can't comment on the wine, but the sandwiches here are wonderful. This seems to be the place for the countryclub set to lunch, so they are expensive, but if you are going to pay for a gourmet sandwich, this place is 1000 times better than the competition. The Grilled Cheese Supreme on crisp buttery challah bread is sublime and the Roasted Turkey & Bacon is accented by rosemary aioli and crisp greens. Top notch ingredients!", 
      "Nice choice in SW Champaign. \u00a0Part wine store, part deli, part cafe, kind of tries to be all things. \u00a0That's where I ding it a star. \u00a0The food has always been good, and they have lots of choices of salads, sandwiches, and even dessert - maybe too many. \u00a0I like going to the deli and having them create me a plate of cheeses and meats to sample. \u00a0The ambiance is pleasant and somewhat upscale. \u00a0This is in an affluent residential part of town, and the clientele mostly reflects that. \u00a0I think the mark-up on their retail wines is high - I would go to Corkscrew or Friar Tuck instead. \u00a0Nice place to unwind though, with outdoor seating too, and I never felt pushed to leave.", 
      "This is my new favorite spot to go without the kids. The cater to a more mature crowd, which I enjoy. The food is amazing. The prices seem a little high, but the quality is also much higher than you would expect to get from a chain. Their pretzel bread is to die for! \u00a0They have wine tastings every Saturday that are fun and informative. The owner is very friendly and personally greets us every time we stop in.", 
      "One of my favorite places to go for lunch with my friends. \u00a0Always busy, so get there early. A nice place to start with a glass of wine then have soup and sandwich or soup and salad.", 
      "This is a cool place for lunch and sipping wine outside in the non-winter months. \u00a0I wish they'd move to downtown Champaign, the location sucks! \u00a0Oh and they have a great selection of wines in the store too.", 
      "Everything was Delicious!I never write reviews, but this place is worth writing about. This was our first time going there, and it definitely won't be our last. We both ordered the half Soup & Sandwich. My fiance got the Club Paradiso and Corn&Potato Shrimp Chowder. I got the BBQ Pulled Pork and the same soup. Now the BBQ Pulled Pork was AMAZING!!! I couldn't not get enough of it, so I ended up ordering another half of a sandwich. :)) Also, the service was wonderful, despite a few mistakes. The man that was making our food behind the cheese display was so kind and attentive to everything we needed.", 
      "Went here looking for some food to warm up with after spending a chilly afternoon outside - was not disappointed!! My sister and I split the black bean burger sandwich and the lemon twist sandwich. Both were amazingly delicious! The lemon twist was different from anything I've had before; the goat cheese, spinach and beets were a surprisingly perfect combo!their beer and wine selection is also fantastic - the man who was providing samples was very knowledgeable and explained each wine and beer we tasted thoroughly.I would most definitely recommend this place for their food, and drink selection!"

      "I surprised my girlfriend (from northern Italy) on her birthday with dinner at Bacaro. The atmosphere is very nice and sophisticated. We were promptly seated (we had reservations) at a beautifully set table right by the window. For starters I ordered a negroni and she had a glass of white wine. We then ordered our meal: pizzetta with zucchini and burrata as our antipasto, bucatini and fusili as our primi, and salmon and scallops as our secondi. The appetizer was a little underwhelming, not enough burrata in my opinion. The first plates were very, very good and reminded us both of Italy. There was however, one issue: my girlfriend's plate of fusili came with a hair on it. We told the waitress and she immediately took care of it and was extremely apologetic - very professionally handled. \u00a0Our second plates were even better than the first. The salmon and scallops were cooked to perfection and left us both wanting more.We finished the night with a caff\u00e8 corretto (on the house). They also gave my girlfriend a birthday present of chocolate dipped biscotti which was very thoughtful and a nice finishing touch to a wonderful night.The unfortunate fact that we got a hair on one of our plates and I am still leaving a 5 star review should speak volumes about this restaurant's quality of food and service.", 
      "This review is extra late. I came here with my friend when he was visiting from San Francisco. We came the Monday before Thanksgiving and had a reservation, although they were not busy. We had their Market Monday menu since it was Monday. It had a very Thanksgiving theme to it, but my favorite was the beet salad. We also had wine pairings with each course and they were all pretty good, except for perhaps one of the wines. I don't remember which wine it was since this was so long ago. Overall, a nice, quiet dining experience.", 
      "This restaurant is sort of hit and miss. I have had some really spectacular pasta with sea urchin. And some fairly mediocre short ribs. This is one of the best restaurants in the area but it wouldn't hold up too much competition elsewhere", 
      "Full confession. I have never been here for dinner, which is the main draw if this restaurant. I went on a Friday afternoon, when they simply have one item for a little lunch special. Well, sweet Jesus it was awesome! This particular day was the Ciabatta bread sandwich with fresh mozzarella, real garden tomatoes, pesto, and cucumber salad for side. $12 including a drink. So good! Get over there and give it a try.", 
      "yeah... so what, I have only eaten here twice. Like there could be a bad meal from this spot. Staff is awesome, all of them. Front of house, back of house, big props. I have had food that I had never had (black truffle risotto) , and I have had things I have had before (grilled octopus and pork cheeks!) presentation, quantity, ambiance, vibe, wine, champagne. This is a comfortable yummy spot. When I get my duck in order, I will eat out a bit more often, and well... I can't wait.done shun", 
      "Been here many times before and so had certain expectations. Food, service, and ambience always excellent. Well tonight things went quite differently. It was looking like a total disaster. Issues with food service reservations etc. Then Rose (asst mgr) came to the rescue. Within a few minutes everything was made right. Loved Bacaro before, love them even more now. Definitely will be back. Rose was simply amazing!", 
      "Wonderful combinations of local ingredients; menu evolves with availability. Quiet, stylish, atmopshere. Sunday \u00a01/2 price wine by the glass is a great deal. You won't regret going to Bacaro. This place would do well in Chicago or any other \"foodie\" city.", 
      "Great atmosphere. Very well prepared food. Exceptional service. The roasted cauliflower is super delicious; my husband doesn't really like cauliflower but loved it. He had the scallops which were perfectly cooked; they came with \"scalloped\" potatoes (mashed potatoes formed into sea scallop shapes) that were nicely crisped on the outside. I had the duck but I can't remember the sides, so maybe it wasn't so memorable.They also make their ice creams in-house (as any restaurant of this caliber should).Highly recommend Bacarro for a nice evening out or when you have guests used to finer dining.", 
      "1st time here...for an appetizer we had the Burrata - roasted beets, chive, pistachio, beet green pesto, chili oil was. We also had the Peas and Carrots. \u00a0Very light and extremely tasty! For the main course, the Smoked Potato Gnocchi was AMAZING and the Wild Striped Bass was very flavorful! The wife enjoyed the bass thoroughly, \u00a0but we both agree the smoked potato gnocchi was the winner! Nice atmosphere and friendly staff! \u00a0We will definitely come back!!!", 
      "Our favorite restaurant in Champaign. \u00a0Service is great and very friendly (apart from one server we had last fall who has, thankfully, seemed to have left). \u00a0Food ranges from very good to amazing. \u00a0We've never had a bad meal at bacaro.You can throw down a lot of money here, but you don't need to. \u00a0The bar is great, they have reasonable and interesting wines by the glass, and you can have a few appetizers or smaller courses and leave without spending too much and but still feeling like you had a special night out.Highly recommended.", 
      "Tasting menu sucks. \u00a0Totally overpriced. \u00a0Tried several things:- \u00a0Cauliflower soup: \u00a0It was okay.. very creamy and not too much cauliflower taste.--------------------------------------Two stars. \u00a0How did I never know anything about this place when I went to school here forever? \u00a0Maybe I came here once for a drink.. I can't remember anymore.What a delightful spot with outdoor seating so you can enjoy the summer nights.First.. Sunday is half priced wine days... yum! \u00a0The Pinot Noir was the favorite amongst the Syrah and Malbec.Second.. the cheese plate was heaven. \u00a0How delicious! \u00a0You have to try their jam and the bread is pretty good.We also tried a few things for dinner.. the risotto and pig cheek pasta dish. \u00a0The risotto was decent but the pig cheek dish was good with a hint of chili.For dessert we tried the ice cream cake which was yummy but quite small. \u00a0I heard the panna cotte is heaven but they do not serve it anymore because it's been on the menu for a while.. WHAT?!! \u00a0I know...Overall lovely experience.. I hope they put the pana cotte back on the menu. \u00a0This is definitely fine dining in downtown Champaign... it's growing up slowly but surely.", 
      "Second trip to Bacaro.Prix fixe dinner for two with the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu.$145We left hungry, and shaking our heads.Walked across the street to Esquire and had dinner again.When McDonalds could have profitably sold me 145 hot hamburgers, don't let me actually leave hungry.", 
      "First, I love the extensive wine selection! Their bottle selection is really impressive. We had the pizzetta for an appetizer which has a great combination of flavors! I also loved the risotto, it was amazing! The overall ambiance is beautiful, altho it was a tad bit loud. The service was excellent. The prices seemed relatively fair, but on the more expensive side for restaurants in Champaign. Overall, definitely recommend it for a romantic date night.", 
      "I really liked Phils dish better than my own but the ambiance and the service was excellent, now off to The Molly!!! :)", 
      "The best restaurant in Champaign-Urbana if you don't mind the price.Sometimes the dishes \"try too hard\" to be unique and modern; I'm all for molecular gastronomy and modern cuisine (even tried some in my kitchen) but the combination has to work. Chocolate cake and bacon? Not as good as chocolate cake without bacon.", 
      "Who would have thought that I'd pick a place in Champaign for my 600th review!... Well, Bacaro certainly deserves it: I finally went there for dinner last night (after wanting to go for several months), and I was wowed. I'm still salivating thinking about it.I went there with pretty high expectations (I'd heard great things about it from several friends and coworkers): that's usually not a good thing as it makes it easier to be disappointed, but Bacaro did not disappoint. In fact, I'm happy to say that my dinner there was on a par with my best dining experiences in NYC.First and foremost: the food. My boyfriend and I decided to share a bunch of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, as well as the roasted suckling pig with homemade sauerkraut: they were both absolutely delicious (don't miss the suckling pig!). We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding. That was some seriously great food!!As Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty good. Not to forget the 10yo port we got with our dessert (very generous pour...), which was good also.Service was great, ambiance was great (although it's a shame that the place was so empty)... it was really a great dinner (sure, it was not cheap, but entirely worth it!). By far the restaurant in Champaign, in my opinion. I'll definitely be back.", 
      "This place was a bit of a disappointment for me. \u00a0I was really excited to try it since I heard the chef was an apprentice of Iron Chef Mario Batali (yes, I love the Food network).The service wasn't great, and even though it seemed fancy, the decor wasn't all that great either.The food is expensive (which I was expecting), but the pasta that I got was pretty bad and for some reason tasted a lot like bacon (which I wasn't expecting). \u00a0Don't get me wrong, I love bacon, but not when it doesn't have bacon in it and isn't supposed to taste like that at all..I definitely wouldn't go back here, but it was an interesting experience.", 
      "What one would consider fine dining - especially considering the fact we're talking about Champaign - Bacaro's boasts of an extensive wine selection and the best of traditional Italian cuisine. \u00a0We ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, and, because I wasn't feeling very adventurous, chose the oven roasted chicken as my entre. \u00a0Overall, I found both these dishes a little too salty (maybe the chef was just having an off night?). \u00a0The portions are modest, but you would probably expect a little more for the price you're paying. \u00a0They did have a decent cheesecake and the check came out with a couple yummy chocolate chip meringues, but overall I guess I was a little disappointed.In consensus with what many others have said, service was very attentive, but I felt it was almost to the point of pretentiousness. \u00a0Based on this experience alone, I would most likely not recommend Bacaro's nor dine here again, but I really don't want to dislike this establishment and would like to come back again sometime in the future and give it another chance. \u00a0Until then, I say stick with Radio Maria.", 
      "A wonderful place to take a date. Romantic, quiet, and a wonderful wine selection. Over the weekend I took a date here for dinner. We both had the filet. It was wonderful! \u00a0Cooked to perfection, and melted in our mouths. Not to mention, we washed it down with a great Cabernet. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys an upscale experience.", 
      "My date secured us a reservation here for Valentines Day.Pretentious. Server was snooty, bar man was snooty. The patrons also the same. Crammed seating.It was crazy expensive, I understand local farm products, different menus, blah blah blah..but in Central Illinois? Seriously, $28 for a chicken leg? No thank you. The prices were a turnoff and the food was OK, maybe we picked the wrong dishes. The whole time my date and I were staring at this couple that did the at the time $98/person tasting menu...one YOUNG lady and a very old man... and they were a riot so I guess we had fun watching them. Other then that, Meh.", 
      "I have NEVER ever had a bad dish here. The service was always so spot on, but then again that might just be because they know me.I am always impressed with the ideas Thad's crew thinks of...and I am such a fan of ANYTHING the dessert Chef Allison makes, that girl is incredible!Sure it is pricey, but it is mostly local products, which makes me more than happy to fork over more. They seem to be particular to detail, which is a plus to me!The wine is top notch too.Honestly, anyone who finds Bacaro pretentious must be insecure, or needs to be more social. Good Lord, fine dining people!! You pay for what you get.ALSO!! Thad has also mentioned to me how he likes his business to have less seating so its about quality, and not quantity. RESPECT that!!I think I need to save to go there again, so worth it!!", 
      "Haha, came to review this place and realized I reviewed it four years ago, when I ate the admittedly boring student prix-fixe. Hopefully they don't do that anymore. Since then I move to Stockholm and then New York City. I was back in the area for a few days and decided to try Bacaro again. It was really very good. Yes, despite the fact that there is a lot of mediocre food in the area, it's not the area's fault. Champaign-Urbana has fantastic terroir. There are many producers nearby making food that is world-class and Bacaro uses these ingredients to great effect. I LOVED the goat cheese salad and my rich creamy risotto. Fried sweetbreads were luscious. My boyfriend's chicken with chicken liver was delicious. I guess the only complaint is that the prices here are the same as in NYC...", 
      "I've had my second experience at this C-U gem and so far we are 2 for 2. Another comfortable street side table was provided for my daughter and I. A terrific wine by the glass accompanied our appetizer of flat bread with chorizo and cheese. She had a medallion if beef and I had scallops, cockles and", 
      "Pretty good food but a bit pricey for what you get. Compared to higher end restaurants in Chicago the food here isn't really that expensive and the quality is generally very good. However, there are many places in Champaign which both cook well and charge lower prices as well (usually ethnic food though).Seating is limited and parking can be difficult to find but there's really no doubt that the food served here is the best in Champaign.", 
      "I wish I could give Bacaro five stars. To be fair, there's a lot to like about it. The quality of the ingredients is high. The ambience is great too. The servers are among the most professional in the C-U area. The food is genuinely sophisticated. However Bacaro's commitment to local, seasonal ingredients, while being one of its strengths, is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The menu at Bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock. This tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing. Of three visits I've eaten some bad, ok and great meals.Visit 1:Had halibut with some kind of crust in a mint-gazpacho. The fish was fresh and of excellent quality. This was frustrating however because the fish was coated in a greasy crust that became soggy from the fish sitting in the mint gazpacho. The gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty. What could have been a complex, herbaceous broth, wound up tasting like greasy mouthwash. Fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep.Visit 2:Valentine's Day prix-fixe. Three courses all of which were delicious. The appetizer was some kind mediterranean type salad if I recall with olives and I think preserved lemon. Delicious and fresh! My main was halibut again, with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey. My girlfriend got the steak and it was of great quality with a strong preparation to match. The dessert was a chocolate torte with blood orange sorbet- good flavors that were well-executed.Visit 3:Pork loin with mustard spaetzle. The spaetzle were delicious! I could eat that spaetzle every day. The pork however was DRY. Really, really dry. I was trying to conserve the mustard sauce on the plate in order to make sure there was enough to get on each slice of pork. It was that dry. So in closing out of three, expensive visits, the food has been good maybe 1.5 times- with me being able to say I enjoyed one complete meal (valentine's day) and the side of one of my mains (the spaetzle). If the food was consistent, Bacaro would be an easy 5-stars. Hopefully they can strike a balance moving forward between rotating fresh, seasonal ingredients and maintaining a consistently-executed menu.", 
      "I always love Bacaro! \u00a0This was actually my second time here and it was such a nice evening in Champaign, that our party of 4 asked to sit outside even though our original reservation was for the inside and the staff was very accommodating.The wine is half price on Sundays so I had 3 glasses. The Pinot Noir was delightful and the Cab Sauv was decent as well.With wine, we had a cheese plate with 5 cheeses and plenty of bread.For dinner, the risotto with rabbit was tasty.Dessert was a red velvet ice cream cake. \u00a0It was okay. \u00a0Bacaro used to have a panna cotta that was memorable to the point where, it was the one item I truly wanted to have again when returning to this spot. \u00a0Oh well, maybe next time.Overall, a great spot for good food and drink.", 
      "Tranquil, calm and romanticWine bar is pretty decent and deserts taste good.", 
      "I rather enjoyed Bacaro. \u00a0It had a really nice atmosphere, quality food, and good wine.I was impressed that time was taken to talk to my wife and I to find a wine to pair with both of our meals. \u00a0The pairing was correct and the wine went well with our meals. \u00a0It was somewhat amazing also the fact that it wasn't a very expensive wine that was suggested.This is a very good place to eat in the Champaign area. \u00a0The reason I gave it 5/5 (instead of 4/5) is because even though the food is a little over priced in my mind, the service, atmosphere, and location lend to it receiving a 5/5.", 
      "This is the perfect place to stop in after a longday of visiting family and friends. Not too noisy, good food, and any beverage you like. We didn't order entrees just appetizers and salad. Theystill sent out an Amuse-Bouche and sliced baguette with olive oil. Nice. We wish we would have been hungry enough for a full dinner but we had been eating all day long. Next time I think I will budget my stomach space and leave some room for Bacaro. You should too.", 
      "Very expensive and not particularly large dishes.If you're okay with this first statement, this place is a great place. \u00a0The food is really good and the interior is very stylish. \u00a0Also, the service is great. \u00a0This is a very professional place that you wouldn't expect to see in Champaign.", 
      "Decent food, but not spectacular. The grilled watermelon salad sounded better than it actually was -- it was drenched with vinaigrette... \u00a0Anyway, I had the scallop dish, which was cooked nicely... but slightly bland.  I think the wine here is better. had a really awesome special pinot grigio with literally peaches floating around!!! It was so great. I have to come back here \u00a0to try more of their wines. I think it's probably better to come here just for wine than for dinnerAnd like what everyone else said, the service was great!", 
      "My only complaint was the waitress was a complete moron. I am very forgiving of servers too, being a former one myself. She had no idea what was good on the menu and just kept saying \"Im a vegetarian.\" With that being said, in Champaign, I haven't had a better meal. I had the veal and it was wonderful. I can't recall much else but in a town without much choices other than the usual college fare, this ranks up there.", 
      "If you want to be treated like garbage at a pretentious overpriced \"whatever\" of a restaurant then go. \u00a0My recommendation is avoid because there is way too much attitude here. \u00a0We were greeted rudely when they learned we did not have a reservation.... On a freaking Thursday.... In a college town! \u00a0We walked out, so thankfully they did not get our money and we had a wonderful meal just two doors away.", 
      "Flavors were generally ok, but the pork and rabbit were overcooked and the scallops weren't seared properly. \u00a0Also, the portion sizes were a bit large: we'd have preferred more quality and less quantity for the price.Update: we returned a second time to a much better meal. \u00a0The lack of consistency should be a big concern for the owner, though.", 
      "Food was excellent but did not have a great experience with waitress. Table of 8, we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings. \u00a0Wine came out about 10 min after our food on a few courses which left us unable to experience the \"pairing\" as you should. We politely and discreetly asked her to bring wine out with or right before food and I think that ticked her off. After that, she was aloof, barely explained the wine or the dishes we were being served. Water was slow to be refilled. The real kicker was the 20% automatic gratuity she added after tax on our bill! When we asked to speak to the manager, she told us \" he's busy dining with a client\". Say what??? I believe your customers are your priority! We asked a different waiter to see if he could find the manager and low and behold, out he came! \u00a0Tainted our experience and maybe our waitress was just having a bad day but when you are dropping that kind of money on dinner- you had better train your wait staff on how to properly serve and deal with customers. \u00a0It was a shame because from the chef end- he did a great job of making delicious and interesting food- it's just too bad no one explained it well or delivered it professionally.Just wanted to post an update. We received a very kind letter from owner/ manager apologizing for our experience and gave us a generous gift certificate to try them again. \u00a0We definitely will give them another chance. Again- the food is amazing and we want to see them succeed.", 
      "I am a huge fan of high end restaurants and since discovering my addiction I've been trying all of them within reasonable driving distance of my home. Bacaro is one of the most upper-endish restaurants around, so I had to give it a try.I liked the atmosphere, very modern and mood-setting, and the staff was nice. The food however was just a bit too out of the ordinary for me. I prefer classic dishes done to a high standard over the creative and stronger-flavored inventions they had here. I found the food more interesting than delicious, which in the end left me a little disappointed.If your palette is bored, adventurous, and experienced you might like Bacaro, I'm not quite there yet.", 
      "FANTASTIC!I've been wanting to go to Bacaro for awhile, but my husband and I have been too busy. \u00a0We finally made time last night.Atmosphere: 5 stars. \u00a0Great atmosphere, dimly lit, very nice.Service: 5 stars... we found the service to be extremely high caliber without being snooty. \u00a0We ate at NOMI in Chicago a few weeks ago and the service was comparable. \u00a0Quality and Kind... just the kind of service we adore.Food: PERFECT. \u00a0I'm not a \"foody\" but I adore good food. \u00a0The octopus was the best I've ever had. \u00a0The gnocchi was incredibly savory. \u00a0My husband tried the steak and I had the lamb special. \u00a0Both were FANTASTIC. \u00a0Wine suggestion: 4.5 Stars. \u00a0Wine was good, not great. \u00a0I'm not sure if we failed to describe what we wanted. \u00a0Would be nice to have some descriptions in the wine menu. \u00a0We've been to several nice restaurants in Chicago that provided descriptions of at least a subset of wine choices. \u00a0This is such a minor point though.We did not eat dessert as we were stuffed.I can't say enough good things about this very very special restaurant. \u00a0I'm just disappointed we took so long to finally get around to eating there. \u00a0We will be back... this is now my favorite restaurant in Champaign Urbana!!", 
      "I was very pleasantly surprised. Great service, great atmosphere and amazing food! There were some trepidations from my party, as ingredients found at Bacaro were uncommon, but with the server's help we all were very pleased with our orders! Also a great wine selection topped off the evening- also ordered with the staff's assistance. Awesome place!", 
      "I enjoyed my meal at Bacaro, but I have a hard time justifying the price. \u00a0On the whole, the food was very good, but the overall experience fell short of my expectations for other dinners of similar quality that I have had elsewhere. \u00a0 First, the atmosphere of the restaurant, while nice, did not strike me as anything special. \u00a0That said, this could be a product of where I sat. \u00a0 Even though I placed a reservation close to a week in advance, I found myself sitting at the table nearest to the kitchen with my date. \u00a0While she had a view of downtown Champaign and the restaurant's interior, my own view was of a row of temperature controlled wine racks and a junky-looking electrical socket near the kitchen's entrance. \u00a0 \u00a0 For the appetizer, we had the pizzetta, which didn't strike me as anything special: \u00a0just bread, cheese, grape tomatoes, onion, and bacon. \u00a0 Our entrees-- the braised rabbit and the grouper-- were better, but as others have mentioned, the portions were quite small, even for a restaurant focused on contemporary fine-dining. \u00a0Thanks to a bottle of wine and a second helping of bread, nobody left hungry, but with the final bill clocking in at close to $120, it was hard not to walk away with a sense that some of that money could be better spent elsewhere. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ultimately, in giving Bacaro three stars, I am rating it in the context of other \"fine-dining\" establishments. \u00a0The restaurant's chefs clearly know how to cook, and their wait staff is very well trained, but I don't think that either the food nor the space warrants the price that they have set on it.", 
      "Nice, elegant, cozy place to dine.Nice menu with a good mix of local farm products (veggies) and very fresh menu.The food was a little salty but very original and tasty. Service was a tad slow and not timed well but it was very busy.Service is the only reason it was rated a 3 but the food is a 4."

      "I had the 6 course tasting flight tonight at Bacaro and it was incredible. \u00a0My friend and I ate and drank wine for 3 hours, and I felt completely taken care of but not intruded upon by our totally awesome, knowledgeable, helpful waiter the entire time. \u00a0100 thousand props to said waiter, who didn't give the check to my male dining companion just because there were two of us and my male dining companion was male.I can't agree with the other reviewers about the portions; I was FULL by the end of the third course and still had half a meal to go. \u00a0I think if I had even just ordered the linguini that was our 3rd course I still would have been full.This is definitely a special occasion kind of restaurant, but I will certainly go back if I ever have a special enough occasion again.", 
      "Hmmm, what to say, what to say. \u00a0I came here for dinner the other Sunday night, place was quiet but very nice in terms ambiance. \u00a0The menu was very nice. \u00a0The service was excellent. \u00a0The food would have been good, even excellent except the chef was very heavy with the salt, every dish was salty, excessively so. \u00a0Not enough to send it back but one more grain of salt and I would have refused to eat it. \u00a0My companion suffered the same fate. \u00a0The wine list was either very expensive, they did not have it or Slovenian, not sure what's up with that. \u00a0We ended up drinking beer because we could not find anything we liked. \u00a0I'd give the place one more try just to see if perhaps this was an off night.To the other raves comparing this place to the top restaurants in NY or Chicago I would say \"oh please\"! \u00a0It was good, showed promise of things possibly greater but comparing it to a dozen places I could name off the top of my head in either city Bacaro was good but at these prices it should have been better.", 
      "We had an absolutely great meal at Bacaros! We went all vegetarian but the mushrooms, beets, and prizetta were awesome!", 
      "Bacaro (pronounced bah-kah-roh') is a trendy little ultra-modern wine bar. \u00a0The food is largely excellent, though portions are modest. \u00a0Bartenders and waiters are generally quite knowledgable about the huge selection of wines they have, which is a great plus. \u00a0And prices are rather reasonable, though not great.Perching yourself at the bar for half-off wine and some dessert on Sunday night is a great way to enjoy the ambiance of this hip little place.", 
      "Went here for dinner in February 2011. \u00a0Extensive wine list, great service. \u00a0Food was not so great. \u00a0I had the duck dish for app and monkfish for my entree. \u00a0both were too salty. Maybe it was just that day? Also kids who wail/scream should not come to wine lounges! (the rest of the crowd was fine, just these two kids who sat at the table next to us...)I would probably go back here but just to try the other wines...and sit at the bar.", 
      "There are not a lot of really nice dinning restaurants in Champaign. \u00a0The menu is seasonal and changes at least 4 times per year. \u00a0All made fresh, nothing frozen. \u00a0I would like to see more variety.", 
      "Bacaro serves refined, restrained, beautiful, absolutely delicious food. If you are looking for fine dining in Champaign, this is the place to go. I've never eaten anything there I didn't love, the servers are friendly and knowledgeable, and something about the atmosphere is soothing.Thad Morrow is an asset to Champaign and this is a restaurant to be appreciated. I love the way they use their produce here and tend to gravitate toward the vegetable dishes. The staff definitely makes the effort to work with local, quality and seasonal ingredients when possible, and it pays off. The flavors are bright and fresh, and Bacaro completely honors the quality ingredients it sources. What more can you ask for in a restaurant? The prix fixe Market Monday menus are always a treat. And when I can't splurge on a full dinner, I enjoy popping in to sit at the bar with a glass of wine and a small plate. I can't even name the Bacaro dishes I have enjoyed the most--everything I have eaten here, from the soups to the salads to the pastas to the entrees, has been a pure pleasure. The kind of food that makes you say \"ohhhh god\" after every bite. For Central Illinois it may be a splurge, but I'm telling you, eating here is worth 100 meals at Destihl or Radio Maria or Seven Saints or Guido's or any of those other totally mediocre downtown restaurants.Bacaro also seems unpretentious. It's definitely upscale, but I feel completely comfortable going in there in jeans and moccasins and unbrushed hair. (...Or maybe I'm just an oblivious slob.) Oh, and maybe this is irrelevant for a restaurant review, but I have to mention that once I was there the night a guy proposed to his girlfriend, and the restaurant sent out glasses of champagne to every customer in there. You also get amuse bouches before dinner and little homemade dessert bites with your check. I love touches like that.My one complaint is that it's harder than it used to be to get a good boozy cocktail here. There used to be some talented cocktail guys behind the bar. Recently I went in and ordered a Manhattan, \u00a0a totally standard cocktail, and the bartender had to look up the recipe in a book. So I stick to wine and resign myself to the fact that you really can't get a great whiskey cocktail anywhere in Champaign-Urbana.For me the ultimate test is: If this restaurant were in Chicago, a city full of fine dining spots, how would I rate it? Without hesitation, Bacaro would get five stars.", 
      "I had a lovely anniversary dinner here a few years back. I remember the pumpkin ravioli being delicious and the waiter service being great. Portions are relatively small, though. \u00a0I love that they use local ingredients and keep their menu small and creative. They are very active on FB as well, so follow them if you are interested in seeing their weekly specials in photo form. Because of the prices, we didn't go back, but if we made more money, we'd definitely have gone back at least a few more times!", 
      "Used Yelp to find this place and was not disappointed. Very good food and service meant for a great time. Will definitely go back when in Champaign again.", 
      "Wine list was very good. Food was excellent. Service was great. Atmosphere was great. \u00a0Will go again. I wold recommend this to anyone.", 
      "I went for the first time on a Wednesday. I agree with the previous review that this is the place to go for fine dining in Champaign. The wine list was excellent and extensive, probably has the best wine selection in Champaign. Dinner was all-around great, as was the service. The food was fresh. Yes it may be a splurge for the area, but coming from Chicago, it was nice a very nice find.", 
      "I can't help but feel this Restaurant has fooled many. While I've read the food described as \"Authentic Italian,\" I felt it was anything but. \u00a0I've been to Italy, and this ISN'T Italian...I suppose the entire visit was lackluster. The decor had a lot to be desired, but the wait staff were great. However, once we ordered wine (and, by the old menu at least, were supposed to receive the standard 4oz glass) things went downhill. While we were savoring the tiny portion in our glasses, the bartender was doing his best to overfill the glasses of the pretty girls at the bar. When questioned, we were told \"they asked for doubles.\" Who orders a double Merlot? We chose what appeared to be a special at the time: a smoked duck panini. What arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. No, I'm not complaining about the sandwich itself, but they had substituted ham instead of smoked duck, then claimed that I wouldn't know the difference. I'm not sure if it was just this visit or the one that followed that biased me, but I'll never return.", 
      "I'll confess that after nine years I never took the time to sit down in Bacaro for a meal before last night. \u00a0I always preferred Radio Maria, Escobar or some other place for a nice meal. So before we set out on a Friday night for Bacaro, I decided to Yelp it and I was (and still am) very suspicious of a few of the reviews. Here was a place with lots of 1 & 2 star reviews and yet a couple of 5 star reviews, written in great length and gushing detail by Yelpers for whom this was their only review. \u00a0So who writes their first and only review in great length and never mentions anything they ordered, just summarizing it as an excellent restaurant, then never subsequently reviews any other restaurant? \u00a0I may be a cynic, but it raises red flags....So, we set off to do our own independent research: \u00a0Three people on a Friday night. \u00a0The place is full, we get one of a couple of available tables, with no reservations. \u00a0The waitress was wonderful. \u00a0My first requirement to enjoy a restaurant experience is good service, and she was great. \u00a0She knew the menu, she was unequivocal when we asked her what she liked. \u00a0She kept her distance and watched us for cues, never interrupting a conversation and never rushing us nor ever making us wait.The wine list is huge, the drink list is equally huge, but both are very pricey by Champaign standards. My wife's martini was a very full glass, all the way up to the \"c\" section as we Assembly Hall fans would say.We had a risotto special with fish \"for the table\", one mixed green salad, and one fried pork belly starter. \u00a0The pork belly was $10 and was the size of a large marshmallow in the center of a 12 inch plate, humorous by its dinkyness. But good, like a chunk of fried bacon fat.Then we had three entrees, all were very good. \u00a0Mine was the grouper ($28) and frankly I don't recall my companion's meals because we also knocked down one martini and two bottles of Cote D' Rhone between the three of us. \u00a0The Cote D' Rhone was $28/bottle and the lowest price wine on the list. \u00a0Several other wines could be had in the high $30's, and then the rest of the list was north of $40.One apple pie ala mode later and the three of us were out of there for $192 before tip; and she was worth the $40 tip we left, so by the end of the day it approached $77 per person.So if you start a Yelp review at a three, this place gets one more star for having a great server, one star for being in DT Champaign and being beautiful inside & out, including cloth hand towels in the loo. \u00a0Then I'll knock one star off for being too pricey for the market, but if Yelp allowed half-stars I'd give Bacaro 4.5.", 
      "Bacaro has been through some subtle but incredibly effective changes. I am happy to say it has taken back it's rightful spot as both my favorite and simply the best restaurant in town... and one of the my favorite spots anywhere. As I mentioned previously the decor and staff are superb, but Chef Thad Morrow is now to be seen frequently in the dining room, and is doing a much better job of maintaining food standards than than the previous Maitre D'. Food is now flawless, and portion sizes have increased somewhat too, which for most was a welcome change. There is also a new Bar snack menu, which combines comfort-food with nouveau twists, like spicy homemade pork crackling! Bacaro could compete on a world stage, and do very well.", 
      "I can't complain about the prices. \u00a0The food was expensive; the food was good. \u00a0There was presentation to the entire experience, which is something I've found a little lacking since moving to Champaign.I wouldn't want to eat in the bar area on a Saturday night, and if the hostess hadn't been able to move us into the other room we would have had to leave. \u00a0My dad can't hear very well and his hearing is better than my lip reading. \u00a0The bar area is really nice and I'd love to eat there on a Tuesday, which I have.The good: \u00a0The food. \u00a0Three people, three different dishes, and everybody liked theirs. \u00a0I had the halibut and mom had the rabbit, and if you're going in there soon, I'd recommend either, and even more I'd recommend the vichyssoise with crab and asparagus. \u00a0If you're hardline vegetarian (I eat fish) then you'll have problems with the menu, but I believe the waitress at least implied that the chef would make allowances/prepare something else? \u00a0Either way you should call ahead and see. \u00a0I have no complaints about oversalting like other reviewers, perhaps they listened? \u00a0The malbec we drank with dinner was a nice random choice.The bad: \u00a0Our waitress was new. \u00a0At least I hope she was new. \u00a0The service was great but she wasn't as familiar with the menu or wine list as someone working at that caliber of restaurant should be.The manhattans were terrible. \u00a0I suspect Bacaro of being yet another restaurant who thinks they should have their own special manhattan, with exotic bitters and cherry juice and... do you think you're going to save me from scurvy or something? \u00a0I want bourbon, bitters, and sweet vermouth, and go easy on everything but the bourbon. \u00a0This is no time for creativity.The dessert menu is stupid. \u00a0Who follows octopus and rabbit with banana bread and ice cream? \u00a0Hire a dessert chef.I would totally recommend Bacaro if you need \"fancy dinner out.\" Sometimes I do. \u00a0Sometimes I have parents who need impressing.", 
      "This is our favorite restaurant in Champaign, hands down the best food. \u00a0We ordered the tasting menu and were not disappointed. \u00a0Seven courses and all were expertly prepared. \u00a0Staff was friendly and courteous.... \u00a0we'll definitely be back.", 
      "I liked the experience at Bacaro. \u00a0The menu featured interesting foods and preparations, the service was excellent, and the wine list was good. \u00a0Coming from Chicago, I'm spoiled with the level of cuisine we can experience on a regular basis. \u00a0Although this restaurant wasn't quite on the level of Chicago, it was very, very good!", 
      "Bacaro is often spectacular. Outside of Daniel, in New York City, I don't think I've had food this subtle, refined and exquisite anywhere else - something I don't say lightly, as I am well aware I'm talking about a restaurant in Champaign, Illinois. Yet, we have such a restaurant and it's a shame we don't trumpet it more.The pros:The service. The staff is exceptionally well-trained, smooth, and (almost) flawless.The dishes. Creative, never boring, always executed well. And also always worth it. The attitude. Everyone at Bacaro takes operating a restaurant seriously. Bacaro is professional to the core, and proud of it. So, seats aren't ripped, napkins aren't fraying at the edges (even slightly), dirt hasn't built up in corners, the decor isn't allowed to grow stale, the food never leaves the kitchen unless it's up to very high standard.The Chef buys locally - and has for a long time.The decor. Modern, it's visually interesting without feeling \"cold.\" Love the bathrooms and the cloth towels.Location. Downtown Champaign is always fun.Their tasting menus. Spring for it and try one. They can be food revelations.The cons:A lot of people in C-U are unnerved by Bacaro. I've had friends and co-workers describe it as \"too fancy,\" \"too elite,\" \"too cool\" for them (I disagree, but what can you do with someone's insecurities?) That dismissal shows up in other reviews here, too. The dishes. Sometimes all that creativity is just too much. Even though they're really, really good, it's sometimes hard to get geared up for appetizers like \"fried watermelon\" and \"popcorn with truffle oil.\"", 
      "Ridiculous.Beautiful ambience, beautiful waitress, beautiful food. Perfect amounts. Attentive. Just perfect.", 
      "My daughter took me here for Mother's weekend and it was an amazing experience. \u00a0I consider this restaurant to be the best of the Champaign area and want to go back the next time I visit U of I. \u00a0The service was attentive and the recommended Pinot Noir was perfect,. \u00a0We completely indulged in the delicious food offerings and got take home for my daughter who has to endure school food on a regular basis. \u00a0Be sure to check this restaurant out!", 
      "I was so incredibly disappointed. \u00a0I love gourmet food, and I thought I was going to get some pretty good, gourmet italian. \u00a0I had to wait over an hour for my reservation, our water was never refilled, and the food was very over-priced. \u00a0I paid almost $30 for the ribeye steak which was the worst ribeye I have ever had. \u00a0If you want ribeye, go to Jim Gould's. \u00a0Their mashed potatoes were very much like the kind you make from a box. \u00a0After I ate there, I went to kofusion for dessert.. it was THAT bad. \u00a0It is also so small. \u00a0There are not even 10 tables in that restaurant, and I can not even believe they are still in business. \u00a0I was so pissed after eating here, that this restaurant is the reason I made an account on yelp.. to tell you all that it sucked.", 
      "I felt decidedly underwhelmed and overcharged.The chocolate cake was the only item that I consumed that lived up to the expectation or the quality implied by the pricing. \u00a0The soup was merely OK and the spaghetti completely underwhelming (bland, in a runny sauce) and a huge disappointment. \u00a0I also felt that I was missing a spoon to easier roll the spaghetti in, and I don't really see the point of being given a knife instead. \u00a0Finally the Malbec I ordered (by the glass) simply shouldn't be on the menu in a fine dining restaurant.To complete my negative experience, everything on the menu was 2 to 4 dollars more expensive than the already high prices posted on their \"sample menu\" online. \u00a0 To be fair, the service was fine (although not extraordinary) but obviously couldn't compensate for the rest.", 
      "Have eaten here MANY times over the years, from when it was just a panini joint to just the other day. \u00a0I think this place's most inventive time was its best time, about 3 years ago, maybe a little more. \u00a0Food items are less adventurous and price point has increased with time. \u00a0That said, the desserts under their pastry chef of the last year or two have been TOPS. \u00a0Service I have always found to be very good and knowledgeable, esp. about wine. \u00a0I am curious to see how the metamorphosis of the former Persimmon Grocery into a mozzarella bar (is CU ready?)/wine lounge/private dining salon will go.", 
      "Awesome. I went here with my boyfriend on our 2 year anniversary and we totally spoiled ourselves. The food was interesting, nicely presented, perfectly portioned and delicious! We had the chef's tasting menu and I'm so happy we did. There were things that the waitress brought out that I would have never thought to order but ended up loving more than the others. I'd definitely recommend this place!", 
      "For the price that this Central Illinois establishment charges, one would expect basic restaurant treatment. \u00a0I waited for 15 minutes even though I had a reservation. \u00a0The host was a snooty, inconsiderate person to which I told him, \"relax, this is Central Illinois, there's nothing to be snooty about.\" And most importantly, the food was over priced, did not taste good and the portions were small. \u00a0All in all, not the greatest.", 
      "Best chef, wait staff and ambience in town, topped off by a menu with ample flexibility.", 
      "Expensive food but quite delicious and well presented. Portions are a bit small, but if you're going with appetizers and dessert the amount of food will leave you full and happy without being too stuffed to leave your chair. The waitress made a great wine selection to go with our food. The restaurant isn't very big, the decor is modern. A good place to go on a date if you're willing to spend the $.", 
      "I've been here three times now, and I have to say, it's gotten better in the year or two since it opened. Yes, they still pour meager glasses of wine, but the wine menu is great. And yes, the food isn't really *really* Italian, but it's pretty delicious, whatever you think it is. The first time I went, the risotto was mushy, too wet, and way to cheesy. But today, wow. Just ... wow. The ONLY place within 200 miles that serves burrata. Please order the burrata. What an outstanding cheese. My ribeye was also very good, seared and perfectly medium. Tender and fatty. Yum. My girlfriend's ravioli, topped with truffle, were also delicious.Give them a try. I think especially in a town with very few fancy food options, this is a real treat.", 
      "First off, the chef's mortadella and creme fraiche didn't amuse my bouche. Second, my gnocchi tasted like it came out of a Bertolli bag in the frozen section at a supermarket and the sauce was inundated with salt. After trying some parmesan, which was freshly grated (about the only positive), and pepper flakes, I realized that nothing could save the dish. If you want to pay Chicago prices to impress a date, you can try Bocaro, but don't expect more than oversalted Champaign food.", 
      "another great experience last night at Bacaro. Over the top with wine and interesting food. I did the chefs choice starting with an incredible assortment of meats everything from house cured proscuitto to blood sausage and veal sweetbreads. We moved on to a great salad of raddichio and goat cheese with hazelnuts, a few more really incredible plates-A great atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff", 
      "Simply put, this is, by far the best restaurant in town, and one of the top 5 in the state. \u00a0I eat out a lot, and I always look forward to eating here. \u00a0I actually had the single best dish I have ever had in my entire life here, and same goes for the best dessert I have ever had.I also like that the menu is never the same twice. \u00a0While I do have a favorite dish a some places, I always know that it is going t be an intelligent, pleasing, and not over sized meal. \u00a0This is a place that I go to before I go out, and I like that you can eat and function after. \u00a0I like the decor. \u00a0I have read a few reviews that did not like it, and I do understand them, but I love the Danish modern look. \u00a0It was done tastefully, and with some thought.If I have one complaint it would be that when I am there I can't decide what to get. \u00a0Small menu, but you end up wanting everything on it. \u00a0I lived in Chicago for many years so I had a LOT of great food around me, and I always made a point of going there.", 
      "I took my girlfriend here on our first date, and I could not have asked for a better experience. Food was excellent and the atmosphere was very warm and pleasant. Portions were reasonable, but not huge. Wine is half price on Sundays by the way! Definitely a great dinner date location.", 
      "I just went to Bacaro for my girlfriend's birthday and got some mixed feelings about it. Here's what we ordered:Grilled veal chop with red beets and pearl onionsGrilled sirloin with red cabbage, potatoes, and braised oxtail, in a red wine reductionApple cake with creme fraiche ice creamChocolate brownie with graham cracker ice cream and roasted marshmallowsPersimmon and pistachio bread puddingThe entree and wine were splendid, although a bit on the salty side for the sirloin. However, the dessert left a lot to be desired, in particular the persimmon and pistachio bread pudding. It was just plain soggy and tasteless. I recommend not ordering dessert here if you do plan on coming. In regards to the waitress and hostess, they were very helpful and courteous, in contrast to many of the other reviewers who saw them as \"snooty\" and pretentious. The atmosphere was pleasant and the ambient music was suitable for the occasion.", 
      "Bacaro is very \"hit or miss\" -- there have been times I have loved my food, and other times where the food has been average (but has been expensive!). \u00a0Overall, it is a consistently good restaurant in terms of service. \u00a0However, there are certain dishes that are more tasty than others. \u00a0I would definitely recommend trying Bacaro at least twice in an attempt to determine the types of dishes you like and don't like.", 
      "I am from Dallas and in Champaign for business. \u00a0I looked at Yelp for suggestions on good places to eat and Bacaro seemed to be the place to go. \u00a0I thought it was great. \u00a0Unique tasty dishes!", 
      "One of the few places in Champaign to test your palette. \u00a0next to cafe luna, \u00a0i would say this is the perfect place to escape for excellent wine, food, and dessert. \u00a0Thad is serious about his menu and you feel it when you experience his creations. \u00a0Libby always recommends the absolute perfect wine for every course...don't even bother trying to compete with her pairing knowledge. \u00a0The food is rather smart and inventive. \u00a0the interior is very reminiscent of blackbird in chicago.", 
      "This place is amazing. \u00a0I've only been their twice since each meal costs half a months rent. \u00a0It's totally worth it though. Also, the waiters are great with the wine parings, I've had some of the best wine experiences of my life here!", 
      "Celebrated early retirement with 7 of us and thoroughly enjoyed the tasting menu and Benjamin's service! \u00a0Would highly recommend! \u00a0Food, wine, presentation and service were exceptional! \u00a0Enjoy!", 
      "My boyfriend took me to Bacaro for an amazingly romantic dinner date. \u00a0I was impressed with the atmosphere, the knowledgable waitstaff, and flavorful. I would definitely return.", 
      "My partner and I went here for our anniversary and got the chef's tasting menu + wine pairings. It was probably the best meal I've ever had. Every dish was perfect, and every pairing was perfect. I've never been for a normal dinner off the menu, but I probably will eventually. I'm happy and impressed that a restaurant this nice exists in this little town.One complaint, and not really their fault: A few times now I've walked past to see people in bright orange Illini sweatshirts and other \"lay-on-the-couch\" attire eating dinner. I can't believe someone would go to such a nice place dressed like that! Put on a tie, son! Or at least a button up shirt. Maybe Bacaro should have a dress code."

      "Xinh Xinh Cafe is known as *the* place for pho in Champaign-Urbana, and that reputation is well deserved. We've visited several times over the last two years and had almost every menu item. Every pho we've tried is absolutely excellent. Indeed, it is still good after travel time if you choose carry-out. \u00a0But I recommend eating in. \u00a0The decor is modern, as others note. It is pleasant, with lots of stainless/aluminum. But is is not oppressive or alienating in any way. It is simple fare in a restaurant with a relatively simple decor. (Perhaps exotic to Americans, but pho is really a simple dish in Vietnam.) \u00a0They serve dishes other than pho. Our favorite are the bahn mi sandwiches. Serving sizes of the pho are large, sometimes more than we can eat depending upon how hungry we are. The bahn mi sandwiches, however, are small. When I was in Vietnam we became accustomed to them using a half baguette. These are about six inches long. BUT... bit but... flavor is the best I've had in many years. Every visit the service has been exceptional. They are attentive and take your order very quickly, and they keep your drinks, even water, filled all the time. They are quick to bring extra or different kinds of hot sauces, soy sauce, oyster sauce, etc. if you ask. They lack a web page, but do have a small \u00a0and not greatly informative facebook page. To me, that is not a substitute for a real web page, preferably one with a menu. \u00a0When you approach you feel a bit cheap going to a strip mall restaurant. But the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff quickly make up for that.", 
      "Mondays they have $5 vermicelli bowls IF you pay cash. I don't like places where you need to tip but they don't actually serve you. The guy who was working just brought us the food and that's it. I'd say take out if you can, it's cramped and air is blasting brr!Pho is aight, it used to be better a few years back but if you're not picky with pho then go for it. Bahn mi sandwiches are also just okay- I always get a tummy ache when I eat those, not sure why. I rec the deep fried spring rolls, those are my fave thing there (these also used to be better a few years back but still good!)", 
      "I had the worst of luck with Vietnamese food this past weekend, but I decided to give it another go since there was hardly anything opened on Memorial Day. I ordered the bun thit nuong cha gio and Kenny ordered bun nem nuong cha gio. We also ordered a watermelon bubble tea drink. The flavor of the bun dishes were on point, but I was slightly put off by the cube-shaped meat in my bun thit nuong. What the heck was that all about? I've never had it prepared that way, so in the end, I traded dishes with Kenny. The nem nuong flavor was on point as well, but the meat was cut way too thin that you could hardly taste the flavor at all. The cha gio were delicious, but I wish they were a bit more fried... The egg roll skin disintegrated too quickly during the meal, and that's not appealing at all. Then the worst offender of all: the watermelon bubble tea. We wanted real watermelon, damnit. It was a hot day and we wanted something refreshing. This watermelon-flavored tea drink with boba in it was disgusting as all hell. We couldn't take another sip after one or two. It was that bad. Kenny and I actually thought that we had ordered the watermelon slushie, so when we looked at the menu again, we found out that the slushie wouldn't have been that much better-- it would have been the same exact thing in icy form AND it was more expensive. What the hell? Eww, gross. Luckily, we came during their happy hour and so the price of our meal didn't cost as much as we thought it was going to cost us. Still, I was disappointed to have yet again wasted money on sub-par Vietnamese food.", 
      "My boyfriend and I got takeout for dinner one evening and were very happy with everything. We ordered online, and our order took roughly 15 minutes before pickup. I ordered pho and my boyfriend had a vermicelli bowl - both were very aesthetically pleasing and delicious. We also had the shrimp cake summer roll appetizer, which I would strongly recommend trying!Overall, great price, food, and service. Will be back for sure!", 
      "Kind of pricey for lunch, but I hear they have great diner deals. I'm not a big fan of the pho price, but the flavor is pretty spot on. I do wish they would put more meat into their stock given the big price and the big noodle bowl, but I'd take the authentic flavor over quantity. Toppings are usually lacking as well. They give one lime wedge, a few sprigs of basil and a good tablespoon full of bean sprouts. That's it.Outside of quantity, the flavor is decent and worth going out to eat for.", 
      "Great Pho and spring roles. Their pricing is great and if you go between 5-6 PM and pay cash you get a 50% discount on many items. The service is very friendly and efficient. I have been to Urbana on three occasions and have eaten here 4 times. Just love it.", 
      "Found this place via Yelp on our way to Marion IL. Easy to find, about 1 mile off the highway. Place is packed with students from the school around. Great selections of your typical Vietnamese restaurant. Pho tastes great and I ordered the rice plate which is not bad. Price is a bit on the high side and service is pretty good. Very friendly. We will be back if passing through again.", 
      "I absolutely love the pho! I come here about every Wednesday for $5 pho with my wife. Shred the basil leaves, add the sprouts, and toss in the jalepaneos for a savory broth. Add some sriracha and the hoisin sauce to the small dishes and dip away. Arrive around 5:30pm to beat the rush. Remember cash only for the special. Food arrives snappy, but service is limited. Don't expect water refills, take your cup to the counter and self serve if your thirsty. The broth should quench your thirst though.I've come for the Monday special and it was great, but the pho happy hour on Wednesday is what gets me back. The sandwiches have also been tasty, but pricier.", 
      "I have mixed feelings about this place. Service is always quick and kind, and the food is reasonable. However, the pho hasn't impressed me yet, and some of the dishes just weren't that tasty.. It's also somewhat expensive for lunch, which is always important for us graduate students.. Unless they wow me in the future, it's no more than 3 stars for me.", 
      "After Shai passed on operations to his parents some years ago, Xinh Xinh has recently changed ownership (and is, presumably, out of the family). In the last few years, I went to Xinh Xinh once every three or four months, or even more -- although it is always packed (especially the nights with the $5 specials), I found the quality of the food to have gone down, with lots of shortcuts (unremarked substitutions for the cha gio in the bun cha gio) and just plain missing or weird elements (why did the thit nuong in the banh mi begin to take the shape of nuggets?). I am not sure who is running this place now, or if they plan on making any changes--?", 
      "I was a bit disappointed after being a first timer here the other night. My roommate and I work at a Vietnamese eatery back in the city which made us grow a love for their food. Moving down here we were craving a Banh mi and a noodle salad. We were very excited to tryout this new place although we knew it wouldn't be the exact same we didn't expect this.We ordered a lemongrass chicken Noodle salad and it didn't even look like chicken! It had no type of lemongrass flavor in it as well and the noodles were too soggy. When I asked the server if she could please put all of the veggies on a side plate for me she insisted it was impossible and why would I want to do that. REALLY ? Knowing this is the only Vietnamese place around campus makes me upset about my visit here, sorry but won't be back.", 
      "Not sure what all the hype is here, I've been a couple times, the sandwiches werent that special, they were quite small, and just seemed mediocre. Pho was mediocre too, solid place, but definitely been to better. If you do come here, I definitely would get the sandwiches", 
      "Growing up fairly close to one of Brooklyn's Chinatowns I had easy access to authentic Vietnamese food whenever I wanted. I came into Xinh Xinh not knowing what to expect- how good would Vietnamese be in Central IL?Turns out, it's great! I had the dac biet (Go with this pho- you get beef slices along with all the other fun cow parts like tripe and tendon) and my girlfriend had a banh mi. My pho had flavorful broth (watery pho broth is the worst) and the garnishes were fresh and a good portion. I was really impressed at the quality of my girlfriend's banh mi's bread. Banh Mi is all about the bread- when you've had a good banh mi you know what I mean. We also shared an avocado shake, which we both really liked.My only real gripe, surprisingly enough, was the price. I guess it's hard for Xinh Xinh to get some of the ingredients they use down in Urbana but believe it or not I think the pho in NYC might actually be cheaper and a larger portion (eg, the dac biet here costs about \u00a0as much as xe lua in NYC [xe lua is like a giant portion of dac biet]). Nonetheless, I'll happily come back! Plus my price issues are really mitigated by the fact that they take 5% off if you pay in cash and they have pho happy hour on Wednesday.", 
      "After 7 years in Champaign, I finally tried this place out, and I wish I had tried it out sooner. \u00a0Overall, the food really hit the spot. \u00a0Every time I ate there, I would have a craving to go back the next day. \u00a0I always get the pan-fried garlic beef banh mi sandwich. \u00a0Everything about it is great. \u00a0The vegetables are fresh, the beef is surprisingly tender and non-gristly, and there is a TON of cilantro on top. \u00a0The bread is light and airy but has a slight crispy crunch. The avocado shake is also very flavorful and refreshing. \u00a0Who knew avocado in shake form could be so tasty? \u00a0Service was prompt...then again, I ate there during the summer months, so I can't vouch for the service during the school year when more students are around. Try this place out...you won't be sorry!", 
      "I woke up incredibly, incredibly sick yesterday, with a thudding headache, achy limbs, hacking cough, and sniffling nose.After dragging myself through a long day of class, I knew--KNEW--I needed a decent bowl of soup. \u00a0When I was living in San Diego, the best cure for my tiredness and illness was always a big bowl of pho. \u00a0And I'd just heard that Xinh Xinh Cafe had opened next to the Schnucks. \u00a0Thank God.The space is a bit small, and has a whole \"Chipotle-forced-industrial\" look to it, softened with Vietnamese hats and other cultural items. \u00a0I made a beeline for a nice big bowl of pho and was delighted by the flavorful bowl in front of me. \u00a0However, it could have used a little more beef.That said, I enjoyed myself very much, and the menu is extensive, and the staff is incredibly friendly. \u00a0They've only been open three weeks, so you should give them a shot, especially if you're sick and need a big steaming bowl of pho to feel better.Edit: Keep in mind, they don't take credit/debit cards yet. \u00a0So, just run into schnucks and use the ATM or get cash back.", 
      "Ok everyone will talk about pho because it is like the hamburger of Vietnam.So I'm gonna rave about all the other stuff.1: \u00a0Shai is hella awesome. He really takes pride in his work and you can tell because when he asks how everything was, he's really asking how everything was.2: Get the freaking Banh Mi. Get the banh mi. Get it. Now. I'm going to assume from the domination of pho reviews that a lot of people in CU haven't been converted yet to this most awesome ambrosia of Asia. It's basically a Vietnamese hoagie (I cringe too as I type that): the bastard child of the French occupation of Vietnam that grows up to be a beautiful, exotic Helen of Troy. A banh mi baguette is made with rice flour which gives a fragrant papery aroma (versus the yeasty aroma of French baguettes), a delicate crackly crust and a softly chewy interior. It's filled with any combination of ingredients that reflect the Vietnamese talent for marrying flavors (who else can make something taste hot, cool, spicy, succulent, crunchy and meaty at the same time?).Xinh Xinh's banh mi is effing great! It's not the behemoth banh mi of SF (which are the size of a Fat Sandwich sandwich) but it's the perfect size for a meal. I'll confess that when I go in, I order five sandwiches. Because this place brings out the glutton in me.Shai changes up the menu as well so there are daily specials and new sandwiches to put into my five-sandwich rotation.For starters, I'd go with the B1 (classic), the beef with papaya salad (different), the chicken (comforting) or... well, you see how this gets out of hand.Moving on before I drool more and short out my keyboard.3.) The appetizers are also awesome. Hands down the BEST spring rolls in town. Yes, beating out any of the Thai restaurants. I'm partial to the pork one that has some kind of wonderful crunchy stick. I also tend to add both kinds of spring rolls on top of those five sandwiches.4.) There is some really cool and unusual stuff on the menu for adventurous foodies. There's nothing more thrilling than finding someone in CU who know's what's up and would rather go balls-to-the-wall than play it safe. I'm talking about the egg soda. Not an egg creme soda. An egg soda. Bubble tea is all well and good but... EGG SODA!!This is the only restaurant that I will trek to Urbana to. On the days when I roll out of bed too late to make it there (they are open til ten pm Mon - Sat), I go hungry because I know anything else will be a disappointment. I love this place. If I could live there and eat their banh mi forever, I'd be a very happy girl.", 
      "When writing these reviews, I know that people can't help but compare our local Vietnamese restaurant to other Vietnamese restaurants in L.A., San Francisco, or another urban area with a greater concentration of ethnic cuisine. \u00a0Maybe Xinh Xinh doesn't live up to a well-traveled foodie's expectations in terms of \"authenticity\" or flavor or the size of their pho bowls, but the same criticism could be made about any restaurant in this town (i.e., our best restaurant can't compete with New York's best)...and quite frankly, I doubt many people could shell out $300+ and fly to L.A. just to try your favorite Vietnamese restaurant out there. \u00a0Ok, rant over.So in terms of restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area, how does Xinh Xinh stack up? \u00a0The menu might appear limited, given that most of the items are just variations of banh mi (sandwiches), pho (noodle soup), bun (cold noodle \"salad\"), and rice plates (usually accompanied by some kind of grilled meat). \u00a0However, there are usually 7 or more combinations of each dish, served with different meats, sauces, etc., so the menu is pretty extensive if you plan to sample it all. \u00a0While the restaurant didn't start with many vegetarian options, they've been consistently adding more over time, and the servers are usually helpful in pointing out vegetarian dishes on the menu. \u00a0You should also speak to the owner (Shai), who can tell you about upcoming dates when he plans to have vegetarian daily specials.For appetizers, I really recommend the glazed chicken wings or nantaing (spicy ground pork dipping sauce served with baguette slices and shrimp chips). \u00a0The chicken wings smell a little funky, but you'll overlook that once you get a taste of them. \u00a0I love the flavor of the nantaing, and I especially love the sound of crackling shrimp chips when they touch the sauce. \u00a0I usually order the pate ban mih, though many people complain about the strange \"metallic\" flavor that is often attributed to pate. \u00a0If you're feeling a little less adventurous, I'd recommend the grilled pork ban mih. \u00a0I am also really impressed with the bun (noodle \"salad\") that they serve. \u00a0Xinh Xinh's bun has generous portions of meat, bean sprouts, carrots, and lettuce (yum!), along with the usual rice noodles and spring roll.My only complaint is that the restaurant is pretty small, so it usually can't accommodate large parties unless you're one of the only patrons there. \u00a0With limited seating, Xinh Xinh also fills up rapidly on busy nights, especially for their Wednesday night pho happy hour. \u00a0I would suggest avoiding peak hours or getting your food to-go if you are impatient about waiting for a table.If you add Xinh Xinh as a friend on Facebook, you can get updates on their daily/weekly specials. \u00a0This is really helpful for vegetarians as some of the veg-friendly options (e.g., pho chay) are only offered on certain days.", 
      "Being essentially a Vietnamese food virgin, I was eager to try a big bowl of this pho stuff I've heard so much about. \u00a0I decided to dive in head-first and choose the weirdest option, the pho with tripe and tendon. \u00a0I mean, when else do you see tripe and tendon on a menu? \u00a0Might as well get it.I decided that I really like pho, but not tripe or tendon. \u00a0(Seemed kind of flavorless, and the tripe's appearance especially skeeved me out.) \u00a0The steak and Vietnamese meatballs were delicious, though, as were the noodles, sprouts, and everything else in that seemingly bottomless bowl! \u00a0I finished maybe less than half of the whole thing, and for $5 on Wednesday nights, that is a CRAZY good deal. \u00a0My boyfriend's garlic beef bahn mi was to die for: the beef was excellently flavored and the pickled daikon was crunchy and fresh-tasting. \u00a0I will certainly try one of these sandwiches next time I go back.We split an avocado shake for dessert, and all I can say is WHERE HAVE THESE BEEN ALL MY LIFE? \u00a0So smooth, sweet, and creamy, and still retaining the subtle flavor of avocado. \u00a0Cramazing. The guy ringing us up told us that he uses a whole avocado (!), half and half, sweetened condensed milk, and ice, all blended together. \u00a0He also said that a couple customers had been on him to figure out how many calories were in it, but I begged him not to. \u00a0Some things I'm happier not knowing.", 
      "I don't know why people don't like the wings here. I actually think they are outstanding. Maybe there's a different set of wings from the fried sweet and spicy honey wings. I don't often eat fried food, but these wings have a delicate crunch and they are covered with this great sauce. There's honey, of course, and hot pepper flakes, and possibly ginger...my friend and I are dying to try and replicate this taste.I went today and, since I had gotten my refund check, decided to splurge. I had the lime soda, which was delicious and refreshing and homemade, not too sweet. We split the aforementioned wings, which are moist and delicious, and spring rolls, which were crunchy and fresh and held together well.My friend and I also got banh mi, which I have never had before. I got mine with garlic beef and was rewarded with soft crunchy bread, a subtle bite of pickled veggies, and tender savory bits of beef. I thought it was really tasty! There was a lot of bread, though, and I'm not sure it was much different from a normal baguette I could buy. I understand that banh mi is supposed to be on bread with rice and wheat flour, so I expected it to be a little lighter. Everything was really good though. In fact, I know that in the warmer months they offer vermicelli bowls, and I can't wait to try that. I also want to come for $5 pho on Wednesday. Yum.One weird thing: I'd love it if we got some plates with our appetizers. I always end up making a mess!", 
      "Xinh Xinh is in my opinion one of the best restaurants in Champaign County. While I have tried many things on their menu, their stand-out dish is their Pho. The broth is super tasty, and they use excellent quality meat which sets them apart from the other places in town that serve Pho. When you are finished eating you are full and satisfied. They also have some great appetizers, especially their Nataing.I'm not entirely sure why some people here don't like their prices. They have $5 Pho dinner specials on certain days which is a phenomenal deal (I'm not sure you could buy their quality ingredients at that price at most grocery stores), and their normal prices are less than $10 for a huge portion. A dish is a meal, and you're not going to find much in town that's cheaper. Once you factor in the food quality, eating here is a great deal.", 
      "Good stuff. We went around 7pm Friday night; a 3-5 minute wait for a table. We ordered pho, a banh mi with pork roll and pate, spring rolls, a lime soda, and a vanilla boba tea.The pho was the lighter style; less salty, but also less rich. (I compare it to the Southern style you find in San Francisco.) The tripe was fresh and bouncy, the tendon a little soft, and the beef a little less flavorful than I like, but the noodles were excellent. The broth could be due to the fact we went late. (If they run out of broth during the day, they have to make more, and it can be a little thin.)The banh mi was great - the baguette was very fresh and light. Excellent balance of meat and carrot. The Mrs. thought the meat was too meaty, but this often happens - I tend to prefer my meat a little... gamier. I'm not the biggest fan of daikon, but this worked out. I would ask to hold the cilantro next time, but that's me, not them.The spring rolls - excellent. They include a small strip of what seems like either deep fried tofu skin or rice paper, and a strip of some kind of pork (it reminded me of the kind of maling meat-food-product that you get in spam musubi, but fried). Truly excellent balance of flavors.On a sad note, we never got our drinks (and on top of that, when we went to pay, they explained were out of boba (!), but the service was otherwise full of smiles, polite, reasonably fast (although not fast enough for a working lunch), while leaving us in peace to eat.The owner was ringing us up immediately recognized that we didn't get our drinks and apologized, explaining that they're still working out the kinks. I have no problem with that. They seem understaffed; it's always difficult running a new restaurant and the little extra effort makes me forgive forgetting the drinks.Verdict: Would pay about 2x as much.", 
      "Great food and people running it. \u00a0I highly recommend the vermicelli bowls as they are like nothing I've found elsewhere. Unfortunately I've moved from the area but whenever I'm back I always try to stop back. \u00a0Again: get a Vermicelli bowl.", 
      "I visited Xinh Xinh when it first opened. I had been going crazy over the fact that there were no restaurants in the area that served good tasting, authentic Vietnamese food. Then I found Xinh Xinh Cafe.Their banh mi is still the best tasting I have had to date. Fresh ingredients, great flavor, what more can you ask for? They also have a great variety of specialty drinks that I really enjoyed, including the avocado shake. Definitely expand your horizons. So worth it!The pho is dece - nothing extraordinary. The serving sizes aren't too large, but it does the job when you're hungry and just feenin for some hot noodle soup to warm your bones.Owner is nice and personable. He loves to talk to his customers and get to know them.Love this place!", 
      "It pains me to say it, but there's a reason I don't go here anymore. \u00a0Went there for the first time in months recently and was seriously disappointed. \u00a0My husband's fried fish banh mi had one seriously tiny piece of fish on it, and my nem nuong banh mi was similarly lacking in meat. \u00a0Their banh mi have never been especially generous in the meat department, but this time it was pretty sad. \u00a0It was mostly made of pickled veggies. \u00a0In comparison, Black Dog's sandwiches are about $8 ($3 more than most of the banh mi) and they're huge and come with a side. \u00a0I'd rather pay a bit more and get a better sandwich.Two stars because the banh mi my sister got (creamy pork) was better and the service is always good.", 
      "Judging by how packed the place was on Wed, word is getting out!A solid four stars after trying the 5 buck pho special on Wed nights. \u00a0Trying to be a more adventure-some eater, I chose the pho with all the meats, including tendon and tripe.Everything was wonderful. \u00a0Pho is served with tons of mix-ins to flavor it just to your taste. \u00a0Mung sprouts, jalapeno, cilantro, Thai basil, fish sauce, schriraca, soy sauce, hot cock (the super hot chili garlic sauce with rooster on bottle, geesh ya perv!) etc.I actually really enjoyed everything but the tendon. \u00a0Even though it melted in mouth like butter, just couldn't get over eating TENDON. \u00a0Tripe (stomach) was super chewy in a reminiscent of calamari way.Two other housemates with quite diverse taste were extremely pleased with their soups. \u00a0Others have said in reviews here that they were not full, perhaps portions have increased since then.Our bowls were huge, all 3 of us could only eat about half before full on stuffed. \u00a0Very worthwhile way to spend five bucks on dinner.We had fried spring rolls as an app, and all thought they were awesome. \u00a0Comes with cilantro, cuke, and lettuce to wrap with the fried roll and dip into yummy sweet n' sour type sauce.Looking at the place, you wouldn't probably want to bring a group of more than 6. \u00a0The tiny dining room is set up for 2-4 at a table.", 
      "Okay, so the sad strip-mall location leaves much to be desired, but this is a great little place.There were seven of us, and the owner (well, I'm maybe 90% sure he was the owner) nicely rearranged things in his tiny restaurant to make room for us, then offered tons of recommendations when he realized we were from out of town. \u00a0My lemongrass chicken was good (though I've had better). \u00a0The pho was awesome, and the vegetarians in our group really liked the tofu rice platter and tofu sandwich. \u00a0There are a bunch of different condiments on the table for customizing your food, too.They were completely sweet and patient about doing seven separate checks and letting us wait around for our cab, taking up space in their restaurant for a very, very long time.", 
      "My wife and I were among the first guests at this amazing store-front restaurant. If I recall correctly, we were there on the first night they were open. Since, we've been back a few times, always loving it. Unfortunately, most (all?) of our favorites depend in great measure on carbs, and my wife prefers to avoid the temptation. (When she reads this, I will be in such trouble!)Tonight, being the last night before my wife comes back from visiting family, etc., I went over and had a few of *my* favorites, kinda pigging out a bit.I had the Fried Spring Rolls appetizer, some of the best Vietnamese fried spring rolls I've ever had. They are served with lettuce leaves, cucumber strips, and cilantro sprigs. The intention is that you wrap a Spring Roll, some cilantro, and a cucumber strip in a leaf of lettuce, then dip that package into the lime fish sauce and enjoy. You get a lovely combination of fried, crispy, oily, hot, cool, and fresh.I also had the Nataing appetizer. This is a small bowl (I want a big bowl!) of meaty, spicy, oily, sweet yumminess, served with prawn chips for dipping, and a few pieces of good French bread. (When they first opened, they used a different prawn chip. I enjoyed them because they were different than I'd had anywhere else. The current chips probably are a bit better, though.) The French bread works really well for soaking up the sauce and becoming bites of pleasure.I finished with a Charbroiled Beef Skewer sandwich. Very flavorful beef with a spicy papaya and carrot salad and cilantro sprigs. I wound up removing the top of the (good French bread) loaf (which I took home to have for breakfast tomorrow) because I was running low on capacity. I had a couple cilantro sprigs left from the Spring rolls, which I added to the sandwich. This made a great sandwich. I think with the top bread in place, the bread to filling ratio is higher than I prefer (partly because the meat is so very good).As I was paying, I noticed a white board with a variety of vermicelli noodle bowl dishes. At other Vietnamese restaurants, these are among my favorites, and I will have to come back here soon to try their version.Almost forgot to talk about service. Very friendly and attentive, but between the kitchen and servers, they do not understand the concept of pacing. I got both appetizers and sandwich quickly, but within a span of about 3 minutes. I suggest that if you care about such things, you order the appetizer(s). Then, when you are nearly finished with them, order the main course(s).", 
      "I love this place. I can't tell you how much. The place is a bit small so if you have alot of people get take out. The food is amazing. I could honestly go on and on for hours. If you have never tried Pho get it you will be missing out if you do not. But they have lots of other good things here. I am a fan of the creamy pork vermicelli bowls can't get enough of it.", 
      "So I took the family last night and branched out from my beloved Banh Mi. \u00a0We had pho, a vermicelli bowl (chicken), and the beef spare rib rice platter. \u00a0Pho was amazing, and the noodle bowl looked beautiful, though I didn't get to try it. \u00a0The toddler launched handfuls of the beef spare rib and accompanying veggie egg roll into her mouth fistfuls at a time. \u00a0Preschooler seemed especially fond of the pickled veggies that came with the rice platter.Since this was also my first time dining in, I can confirm that Shai is as great as he seems in the other reviews. \u00a0The place was really busy, but he happily took the time to explain what the specials were, and gave instructions about how to prepare the pho with the herbs, veggies, and sauces.So now I am going to have a true dilemma each and every time I go to Xinh Xinh. \u00a0If everything is great, which one will I choose?", 
      "It's a bit past 9pm on a Saturday night and I call Xinh Xinh to see if they're still open. \u00a0I've never been, but I'd heard good things, and I had a hungry crew of people from out of state to take care of. \u00a0Closing at 9:30? \u00a0We can make it...Good thing I did call, because they were about to close up shop early for the night. \u00a0It's a small place owned and run daily by one guy (Shai), so it's a forgivable practice. \u00a0Just make sure you call ahead if it's near closing time.We felt a bit embarrassed coming in, but Shai made us feel completely welcome and we never felt rushed at any point in the night. \u00a0Since we were also the last patrons of the night, he took the time to make sure we were satisfied and chatted with some of my friends who from his home state of California.I've had a lot of pho in my time, but the broth here was much more flavorful than any other place I had been. \u00a0The meat balls weren't as dense as I'd have liked (that's what she said), but overall everyone was happy with their soup. \u00a0My one sick friend said she felt considerably better once she finished, so yay pho!Protip: they take credit cards and are open Sundays now. \u00a0Shai mentioned a Sunday special on Pho, though I don't know if it was just that Sunday or every Sunday.", 
      "I went here with my boyfriend and we loved it! We both had vermicelli bowls and it was DELICIOUS. I'm a huge noodle fan too, and this was probably one of my favorite noodle dishes I've ever had. It came with this delicious crispy eggroll and it all made for a perfect lunch.The only reason it hasn't received five stars from me is simply because that's all I've gotten at this place. I need to go back and try more, but the vermicelli is just so good!UPDATE: Just went back with the bf and sister this past week and officially added another star. The vermicelli bowls are just too good, especially for Champaign.", 
      "I'm guessing Champaign-Urbana doesn't have a very large Vietnamese population, since this is somehow considered a 4-star Vietnamese restaurant.First, it took forever for our orders to be taken, and a table that got seated 10 minutes after us had their orders taken & brought out first.Secondly, I thought the banh mi (dac biet), quite frankly, sucked. The pickled vegetables overpowered the flavor of the meats, they were too tart, and there was too much of them. Something tells me most of the people raving about them haven't had legitimate banh mi.On the plus side, the guy who was working the counter was very smiley & friendly to a table with a mom & two young kids. I thought that was very sweet.", 
      "What happened, Xinh Xinh? \u00a0We used to take out of town people here because we were so impressed with the place.Last time we got take-out. \u00a0Three banh mis and an order of wings. \u00a0Wings were pretty good and certainly well seasoned with fish sauce. \u00a0(If you are not used to the smell of fish sauce, this might not be too appealing.) \u00a0My wife's sister's banh mi seemed pretty good, but ours had very little meat on them. \u00a0They still had the jalapeno peppers and cilantro, but the mayonnaise seemed less, too. \u00a0I got the catfish banh mi and the fish was tiny - especially in comparison to previous trips. \u00a0We'd noticed a decline in the quality of the bubble teas, too. \u00a0Originally they were really strong and offered flavors that Cafe Evo didn't. \u00a0 But last time we got one (it was a while ago), it seemed like it was made with non-dairy creamer instead of milk.Disappointed. \u00a0Probably not going back - I guess I have an excuse to try making my own banh mi or pho instead.The service was still good, but the food is simply not as good as it was when they opened.", 
      "I have tried multiple things on their menu and have never been disappointed. The curried beef banh mi is my current go to. It is richly spiced and always great. The coffee is always good and the mung bean pudding is a great way to finish the meal. The service is phenomenal and the overall experience has always been good. Highly recommended.", 
      "They now accept credit cards, woot!!! \u00a0No more embarrassed scrounging for parking meter change when someone forgets the cash =POh, and $5 pho after 5 pm on Wednesdays, GO! =D", 
      "My friend ordered chicken wings, when they arrived, the smell which quickly took over our senses was that of eitherA) Fresh fecesB) Rotting dog carcass orC) Satan's nutsackWe sent the wings back and tried to enjoy our meals. The pork sandwich I ordered was below average, very fatty, spilling all over the place and overall lacking in robust taste.Another friend of mine ordered a noodle dish which was not too poor in quality but once again, average at best. I will not be returning to Xinh Xinh...ever...", 
      "The place is lovely with nice service. If you care about the sanitation, this place is better than mandarin wok or golden harbor for pho. I always ordered the dessert after each meal. Try the dessert, it only costs 1 dollar.", 
      "The Pho is tasty (particularly the brisket), but the highlight is definitely the banh mi sandwiches. \u00a0I typically come here with my husband, so we'll split a pho and sandwich, and it's hard to beat.The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because we have a lot of vegetarian friends who we like to dine out with, but I'm told Xinh Xinh only serves vegetarian broth for pho on certain days. \u00a0Would love it if they could figure out a way to have it on the menu full time.But the moral is, give it a try! Definitely the best pho in town.", 
      "Tried Pho for the first time here. \u00a0Excellent stuff. \u00a0It forced me to expand my taste palate a bit, as I don't usually have cinammon, star anise, etc., with beef, but it was very enjoyable. \u00a0Would love to have more jalepeno in the dish, but again, I think that's my palate trying to drag the flavor into something else. \u00a0Huge bowl of beef broth with meats and huge plate of mung bean sprouts, jalepenos, lime wedges, cilantro- excellent additions to the soup. \u00a0Of course I also grabbed my first Boba tea there, excellent. \u00a0The owner was super kind, had great suggestions, and is continually playing to hone his menu. \u00a0We'll have to go back to explore more yumminess.On The Wings:In talking to the owner, he ran down a good portion of his menu for us, and explained what he feels is good and others buy frequently. \u00a0In this discussion he mentioned the wings! \u00a0Guys- the reason it smells funny, as with all Vietnamese cuisine, is that fish-sauce is used instead of salt. \u00a0So... those chicken wings? \u00a0A special fish-sauce dressing! \u00a0If you weren't expecting the smell of fish, there's your issue right there. \u00a0That has got to be the issue with the other comments about the wings.We'll be back, and thanks to all the Yelper's comments on this place! \u00a0Excellent owner, clean, and enjoyable food!"

I would go back to try some of the other Vietnamese dishes.",

      "Not a huge fan. \u00a0I went mostly for the boba tea (eager to try something beyond Evo) but had to eat as well. \u00a0I knew there wouldn't be much for me as a non-beef eater (pho is out) but the shrimp spring rolls were pretty good. \u00a0Not so satisfied with the green tea boba I ordered. \u00a0It wasn't slushy (which is okay) but the flavor was not as bitter as I was expecting from green tea and I just didn't like it. \u00a0So I tried again and got an almond tea, which was more to my liking. \u00a0Flavors seemed a bit hit and miss (my friend's spiced chai was pretty good, but red bean, not so much) so I wouldn't really be willing to go and explore more flavors in case I get more misses. \u00a0On the plus side, the boba itself (the tapioca balls) were smaller, chewier, and overall much more pleasant to eat than the boba at evo. \u00a0The staff was also very nice and friendly -- so points to that.", 
      "Nice people, but when you leave you'll want to get a sandwich somewhere for some protein (or some root vegetables). \u00a0The Pho noodle soup is attractively presented, with a cup of rice noodles at the bottom of a 5 cup bowl of hot broth. \u00a0Then there are two wafer-thin slices of beef swimming in the hot broth, and a side plate of bean sprouts to add to the pho soup. \u00a0Not very fulfilling but it tastes authentic.", 
      "The food is delicious and fresh! I've tried all kinds of dishes on their menu. My favorites are the spring rolls with pork, any of their vermicelli bowls (absolutely amazing), and the lime soda. Not a big fan of the sandwiches, but I think that's more of a personal preference.", 
      "Although my Vietnamese friends told me that the food at X X is not real Vietnamese cuisine, the food there is not bad at for me. The service is friendly and quick. I usually order the #1 Pho which contains all kinds of meat or Vermicelli Bowl which is are dry noodles with grilled meat and vegetables. On Wednesdays, they have $5 plus tax special for all Pho. Great deal!", 
      "I love Vietnamese food. \u00a0I could eat it all day every day for god knows how long. \u00a0When I moved to Champaign a couple of years ago, I was extremely disappointed that there were no good Vietnamese places in Champaign-Urbana. \u00a0There's Saigon down in Savoy, but if you take the bus or bike everywhere (like I do) it's a little too far away.Which brings us to Xinh Xinh. \u00a0The menu is small, composed primarily of appetizers, banh mi (vietnamese sandwiches), and pho (beef broth soup); however, here it's all about the quality, not the quantity. \u00a0I've been to plenty of restaurants with bloated menus that only have one or two things I want to try. \u00a0I think I've tried most of the menu at Xinh Xinh, and I've enjoyed all of it.Also, the owner is very interested in his customers' opinions and will probably come ask you how things are going at some point during your meal. \u00a0He's extremely accommodating to various diets (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free), so if you have a specific need, just ask him, and he'll do his best to work it out for you.To break it down: the place has a nice, modern atmosphere; the owner is a great guy and comes out to get feedback from customers all the time; and the food is a delicious combination of traditional vietnamese flavors with some slight variations (i.e. the fried egg roll wrapper in the fresh spring rolls). \u00a0Just give it a try sometime, and I promise you'll want to go back for more.One quick note: Xinh Xinh is cash only, so save yourself some trouble and make sure you have cash on hand when you go. \u00a0Trust me - it seems like a very small inconvenience once you try the food.", 
      "Pho was average. Not that great.The broth lacked that warm richness found in most pho. I was in the mood for Pho and I was recommended by Yelp and Aardvark to try this \u00a0location. It was a little pricey for the quality and i expected more based on phenomenal reviews. I went with two other friends and one ordered the vegetarian Pho which was actually very good. I more than likely will not return to this restaurant but if I do I'll know to load up on the sriacaha and soy sauce.", 
      "I'm a vegetarian--let's just start there. \u00a0The only reason I ended up at Xinh Xinh was because I'd been told that it existed and because I work across the street. \u00a0I have enjoyed both the summer rolls and the spring rolls so far, and I must say they are delicious! \u00a0The summer rolls are particularly so; they have tofu and fresh veggies wrapped in rice paper. \u00a0The peanut sauce could be a bit less salty, but I can survive. \u00a0I've also had the fried spring rolls, but those weren't as good; they seemed not to have much in the way of veggies and the vegan sauce didn't have much flair. \u00a0They were deep fried a bit too much and I ended up with a stomachache. \u00a0The bubble tea is as good as any; plenty of bubbles but could be a bit stronger. \u00a0I had the papaya.All in all, certainly a place to try, but don't expect a full meal if you are a vegetarian! \u00a0Nowhere near as good as the Vietnamese food my friends have made me, but for Champaign-Urbana, it's probably among the best.Another note: \u00a0they aren't open very late, so keep this in mind!Update: \u00a0The tofu stir fry sandwich single handedly made me change this. \u00a0That, and the vegetarian pho that Shai has once a month! \u00a0Yummy!This has become one of my #1 places for food on-the-go.", 
      "mediocre at best.The pho was good enough but the portion size was wayy too small for $7. I left this place still hungry. I'm a huge fan of Vietnamese food and I really want to love this place, but I left disappointed the two times I went there.", 
      "This place is great! \u00a0Small interior, but beautifully decorated. \u00a0Food is great too - Pho, Banh Mi, etc.The only thing i wouldn't recommend is their banh mi sandwich that's coconut milk and ground beef. \u00a0Something about the flavors didn't settle right, but other than that, The Phnom Penh Pho was fantastic and any of the banh mi sandwiches with radish, carrot and cilantro is a winner!", 
      "I had a very enjoyable Pho soup. The service was friendly and it had a nice \u00a0atmosphere as well.", 
      "Honestly, I had better Vietnamese food in Orlando, Atlanta, L.A., and of course....my friends' parents cooking! !!!At my first visit, the grilled pork bahn mi was stuffed with lots of meat and veggies, but NO jalapeno slices and some weird fermented veggies.Also, during the second time I came here (and introduced my roommate to vietnamese cuisine), I was slightly disappointed in HER order of \u00a0BBQ pork bun (vermicilli rice noodle dish) due too the lack of meat and MOSTLY rice noodles (but good thing SHE enjoyed it!). \u00a0ALSO, when I ordered the grilled pork rice plate and requested not to have an eggroll, but a fried egg (which is more traditional Vietnamese)...the server said he (perhaps he was the owner) does not want to start providing that!?!??!Like I said, I have had better, more AUTHENTIC Vietnamese food elsewhere...but if you never had, this place should suffice!", 
      "Pho chay is great. So are vermicelli bowls. It's not just for vegetarians. The hours seem to be getting weird, but business says sharp. Good service. Good location.", 
      "I never have been a Pho person before...but the pho here is addictive. I would actually say this place is better than Saigon in Savoy. And the vanilla bubble tea is yum! (Xinh Xinh also offers a buy 9 get 1 free card on bubble tea too.)The owner, Shai, is very busy running practically the whole joint on his own...a very warm and welcoming owner, he definitely aims to please!....Urbana is kicking Champaign's butt in tasty food and dining experience!UPDATE: Shai has now included tofu as a substitute for meat in the soups. Of course, the soups are still made with beef broth, but the tofu is thick and killer.", 
      "Been going here more regularly now...and i love it !! What's awesome about this restaurant is that the menu is dynamic and they change things according to the season. Since it's winter they have a new dish called congee, which is a rice porridge that is made out of a veggie/chicken broth...delish...brings me back to my childhood. They also have a few new sandwiches.Don't forget to try out the new curry beef sandwich (which are still a great deal for the price) and the other sandwich with some kind of spicy coconut sauce in it... (watchout for the jalepenos...so fresh ...but spicy!!).Also, subscribe to their twitter/facebook!! They update regularly what's new on their menu...good eats!!", 
      "This is actually the second time I've been here. \u00a0It wasn't terrible, but it was rather underwhelming. \u00a0My girlfriend and I got banh mi sandwiches, since I had recently read about them online. \u00a0On mine, though, the BBQ pork wasn't very flavorful, and the bun was a bit stale. \u00a0This was on a $5 sandwich. \u00a0My girlfriend's was a bit better, because it had grease to soften the bun, but once again relatively underwhelming. \u00a0Also, I felt like we were a bit glossed over in favor of regulars. \u00a0A couple sat next to us, after we sat down, ordered after us, but received their food and drinks before us. \u00a0I'm a bit disappointed after seeing all the reviews and large crowd, but the people there were almost entirely aging hipsters, so I'm willing to accept that their judgment is a bit weak.It wasn't terrible, but I don't think I'll be going again.", 
      "Food is good:) The cook knows what he's doing in that blue apron!!!! =D", 
      "Been here a few times since Smile Politely mentioned they were opening up, and each time I have walked away impressed with the dishes that have been served up.Things can be a little squished due to the size of the place, but the food absolutely makes up for it, both in quality and price. My pho is piping hot with lots of great additions (I did the vegetarian chou pho offered last weekend), and the banh mis are crispy and savory.Best item however are the spring rolls! Perfectly fried and delicious, especially with the mushroom in them, mm-mmm! I would almost want to get several plates of those just for dinner!", 
      "I have only been once but I ate a full appetizer and pan fried garlic beef all by myself.Why? because I could not stop eating it. It was delicious enough I developed a temporary over eating disorder.I can't see the soup's being anything I'll ever try but I am not a fan of asian soups.He's putting on a new summer menu, check it out.", 
      "Let me start off with the good. I thought the cleanliness and decor of the restaurant was good. The tables were not sticky, the chairs were clean, and the floors were clean. I didn't mind that it was a small restaurant. I'm used to that from dining in San Diego. Our server was very nice, patient with us, and made sure our water glasses were filled. Now for the bad part. I did not like the food. Three of us ordered the bun (bun nem noung, bun thit cha gio, bun cha gio) and our fourth ordered the banh mi dac biet. The meat in the bun was extremely dried out, hard, overcooked, and tasteless. I thought that nem noung was suppose to be meatballs on skewers that were grilled or patties that were grilled. Instead we were served chopped up pieces of dried out pork. The grilled chicken bun was the same way. The food portions were fine. I would've preferred much more lettuce, bean sprouts, and herbs. I also would've liked peanuts and fried shallots on top of the bun. \u00a0I also didn't like the the sauce that came with it. It was lacking in flavor. It was neither salty, sweet, nor spicy. The banh mi was average. The pickled daikon and carrots and the cha lua were the best things about it. The pate was horrible. The bread was not the typical banh mi baguette. I've never seen a banh mi baguette that had corn meal on the bottom of it, thus I assumed it was regular American-made bread. It was too dense and hard. The egg rolls in the bun tasted okay. Our food was presented nicely. But the food tasted only so-so to almost bad. I almost wished one of us had tried the pho just so I could get a better idea of the food.I understand my review is somewhat harsh. Two of us are from San Diego, one is from Dallas, and the fourth is my mom. We are used to good Vietnamese food. Xinh Xinh did not deliver.", 
      "I'm no pho expert. \u00a0I've only had it a couple times in my life, but Xinh Xinh makes some pretty good pho in my opinion. \u00a0I had the combination pho which came with a variety of meats including some raw ribeye which cooked beautifully in the delicious hot broth. \u00a0The pho came with the standard pho accoutrements: basil, lime, and sprouts. \u00a0I also had the lime soda which was nice and refreshing, but I'd probably skip it the next time I visit. \u00a0Seems a bit overpriced for lime, sugar and club soda in a cup. \u00a0I've also had their banh mi. \u00a0The bread they use is great, crusty on the outside, soft and tender on the inside. \u00a0Their combination bahn mi is a little funky which I attribute to the headcheese and pate, but it's mighty tasty. \u00a0The pickled vegetables are great although I feel my sandwich had a bit too much and some bites were just bread and veggies while some were just meat and bread. \u00a0However, when you do find a balance between all of the components it makes for one delicious bite.Xinh Xinh will be my go to for Vietnamese food, although I don't believe there are many options for Vietnamese food in C-U anyways.", 
      "Xinh Xinh Cafe used to be a regular stop for me and my roommate on the weekends after running errands in the morning. We have had lunch here several times in the past year, usually to satisfy my craving for pho, which I have enjoyed immensely in Vietnamese restaurants in Chicago and Dallas-Ft.Worth. The last time I came here, I had fried spring rolls and pho with thin sliced beef. The noodles were great, meat was just right, and the bean sprouts and herbs were fresh (but could be fresher). I also had Vietnamese iced coffee (ca phe sua da, condensed milk with black coffee that slowly drips down into the cup as it sits on your table) that was as authentic as any Vietnamese coffee I have ever tasted. Service here has been great, as well. My main gripe with Xinh Xinh cafe is that their portions are incredibly tiny. When I spend $15 for a meal, including tip, I expect to leave satisfied, but the serving size just doesn't cut it for me. I can understand this price point because it's probably the only decent Vietnamese restaurant in Central Illinois, but still, I think they can do a lot better for the price.", 
      "I'm so happy that Xinh Xinh finally opened! I've gone twice now and both times I loved everything I tried. The pho is the best in C-U in my opinion 'cuz it tastes the way authentic pho should. The broth is very flavorful and tastes like time and care was put into it's preparation. The veggies that come with the pho looked nice and fresh. The plum soda tastes just like it does back home...salty and sweet just the way I like it. It's definitely an acquired taste though. The almond boba I tried was also delish and refreshing. The rice paper wrapped spring rolls (the fried version) were very tasty and I loved being able to wrap them in the lettuce and mint leaves. The rolls looked skinny but they were actually quite filling...you get 4. I also tried the fresh spring rolls (not fried) and those were huge! The fried wontons inside were a delightful surprise and the whole thing tasted so good! The meat is definitely flavored well. You get 2 in an order but one was already filling for me. I would definitely still try to eat both by myself though! And the sandwiches...also the best in C-U (although I think Xinh Xinh is the only place that actually has banh mi sandwiches). There's a variety to choose from but I tried the grilled pork sandwich. The size was just right. It had plenty of the delicious traditional fillings like pickled radish and carrots, jalapenos, cilantro, etc. The pork was super tasty and there was plenty of it. The prices were reasonable for this area -- about $2 for the drinks, $4 for appetizers and sandwiches, and $7 for the pho (all prices approximate). I also just noticed that Xinh Xinh has weekly specials for things not on the menu, like rice dishes. I'll have to try that next time. There's actually a lot of other things I want to try. Service is still pretty fast even though I only saw one waiter. For takeout, I would call ahead. Overall, I love this place and I will definitely be coming back as much as I can as long as the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff never changes. [Ok, this review got pretty long...but this place is great. Go try it now!!]", 
      "Food. Well done and flavorful. Don't get the drinks, especially the ones that have salt in them. Bubble tea here tastes weaker than elsewhere.Atmosphere.The interior looks nice overall - much better than you expect from asian restaurants in the same price range. Its a vast improvement over most places. The location next to Shnucks isn't that great either, but its convenient.", 
      "I had been meaning to eat here for a long time and finally did, nothing bad to say but no plans to go back either. Had banh mi which was just ok and chicken curry which was better than most average places but lacking in flavor compared to the top tier in C-U. Another plus they have taro milk tea.", 
      "I highly recommend checking this place out. The food is generally tasty and the staff friendly and attentive. Get a sandwich and a thai iced tea or an avocado milkshake. The pho, on the other hand, doesn't really compare to what I've enjoyed in restaurants on the west and east coasts. I personally think the pho broth here is a bit too sweet, but I know others who enjoy it a lot, so it's a matter of personal taste. If you want to try it, do so during their $5 pho happy hour on Wednesdays from 5pm until closing. Any pho on the menu is $5, which is an awesome bargain!", 
      "I didnt like this place. The vietnamese food was bland and the noddles tasted poorly. The service was slow despite being the fact that there was two tables. I ordered a rice plate and the girlfriend ordered a beef pho. I would recommend ordering from cravings or another vietnamesr place if your in the mood for good vietnamese food. Also the cost was about 20 bucks.", 
      "Pretty good little joint. It's definitely a change from the majority of other restaurants in the C-U area.As for the food, the banh mi is good. Fresh vegetables, tasty ingredients, a little small, but that's to be expected. The vermicelli is good too. Decent portions, delectable stuff!It seems like the rice dishes can be underwhelming (friends orders). Stick to your pho, banh mi, vermicelli.", 
      "My favorite restaurant in Champaign Urbana. The pho here is yummy, and everything served is always fresh, particularly important when it comes to vegetables and herbs. Nice, casual atmosphere with very friendly staff. My particular favorite dish is the ground beef curry banh mi with cilantro and green mango. It's especially delicious if you like some heat and get fresh jalapenos on it. Scrumptious! Also, I quite enjoy the tofu summer rolls.", 
      "I absolutely adore this place! You simply cannot beat $5 pho happy hour on Wednesdays. I go every week and I'm never disappointed. They have everything a solid pho joint needs - great chili sauces, fine grained pepper, lime wedges, jalapenos, sprouts, basil, etc;. Easily the best on campus. The staff is friendly, efficient, and attentive. Plus, they're signed up with Perk Pug so its easy to get deals if you're a frequent customer. Its clean, well-decorated, and rarely too crowded. I cannot recommend this place enough!", 
      "This is a very nice place to eat. \u00a0The Banh Mi sandwiches are delicious and well worth the price. Natang vermiceili bowls are yummy. \u00a0The Pho is good and the summer tofu cake rolls outstanding. \u00a0In CU, this is one of my favorite places to eat.", 
      "Today's lunch marked my third meal at Xinh Xinh since it opened last year. My husband wanted to try the bahn mi special with a beef teriyaki patty so I figured I would too. I think when it comes down to it, I just want the bahn mi without any protein filling. The dikon and sauce are so delicious with the french bread that adding a filling almost ruins it. That being said, perhaps I would feel differently if I chose something less heavy as the protein, like tofu or a thin piece of chicken. This was too meaty, but man oh man the bread, dikon, and sauce have been a hit three out of three times.", 
      "holy shit WORST BUBBLE TEA I'VE EVER HAD. i know a fair bit about bubble tea, and this must have been a sick joke. i thought Evo Cafe on campus had bad tasting bubble tea, but that was only slightly bad compared to what Xinh Xinh Cafe gave me. it was truly AWFUL. i have been to quite a few bubble tea establishments in my life, and never tasted tapioca this bad. \u00a0it's normally chewy, and some places make it firmer than others, which is fine, I personally like softer, but whatever they put in my drink was like... chalky. way to solid. it shouldn't even, be edible whatever it is. \u00a0maybe it had expired?? is that possible?this is the first & last time i go here for bubble tea. maybe their food is better, i didn't try it. also i got the green tea flavor, and they didn't ask me if i wanted milk in it. i feel like most places will ask you if you want green milk tea or not, or at least all the places ive been to in New York City would ask. so i basically was given sugar water with a bit of green tea flavor.aside from the awful drink, the employee was friendly enough, and i feel like for the size of the drink you're getting your money's worth, so that's good at least. but if you want good bubble tea, PLEASE go to Cocomero (on Wright st!) ...it's amazing.OH also, when we got home, we poured soy milk into it, which did make it taste a lot better.", 
      "When I normally go too a Vietnamese place back at home in California, I normally go to get some pho. \u00a0So I thought i'd try out Xinh Xinh Cafe's pho, since it's been weeks since I've gotten my Pho fix! I'm sorry to say, that I wasn't at all impressed with the pho they had at this restaurant. \u00a0It tasted bland. \u00a0You know pho is awesome when you don't have to add any siracha or hoisin sauce to it. \u00a0I definitely loaded my pho with siracha and hoisin. \u00a0But even then, it wasn't so appetizing.Other than this, I thought ALL of the spring rolls here were awesome! You must try the fried spring rools wrapped up in lettuce appetizers. \u00a0Also, one of my friends had an awesome rice place...not sure which one it was, but it was pretty yummy! I recommend ordering \u00a0a rice plate or vermicelli plate, instead of getting any of the pho.Lastly, I was surprised with there fried banana dessert! I normally have vanilla or coconut ice cream with fried banana, but instead, they drizzled this AMAZING chocolate sauce over it....AMAZING! YOU MUST TRY IT! :)", 
      "this spot is pretty chill. i like the whole set up, its nice and cozy. GREAT specials when the owner is in a good mood =P \u00a0the beef dishes can never go wrong. but if u know me im very particular with PHO. i didnt try the pho here but it looked really good. the springs rolls I mean summer rolls, were quite tasty. I like this spot because it's pretty authentic with a little twist... Check it out next time you're in Chicago!", 
      "So happy to find a pho place in CU! \u00a0Ordered some boba tea straight off, way better than what I've tried on green st so far. \u00a0Then ordered the ribeye pho. \u00a0Could not figure out what one of the herbs that we got on the 'toss this stuff in your pho' plate was, turns out they special order 'culantro', which is a more vietnamese type of cilantro... pretty cool. \u00a0Really nice staff/owner, I'll be dropping by again next time I need a big bowl of hot soup.", 
      "If you look at my other reviews I rarely give a restaurant less than 3 stars, but this one doesn't even deserve 1! I ordered chicken wings and a beef sandwich. The wings were rotten!!! Can you believe that?they smelled like garbage, we were completely disgusted by the smell!The beef sandwich was at least edible, but not that good either. My friend who ordered a pork sandwich couldn't finish his as well. I will NOT go back there!", 
      "Banh mi sandwiches and vermicelli bowls are GREAT. Specifically, the ground beef curry and charbroiled beef skewer sandwiches are excellent. Grilled pork is always a safe choice for banh mi and vermicelli bowls. 4 stars because their pho (the quintessential Vietnamese dish!) is only so-so.", 
      "So it was my first time to Champaign and obviously my first time to Xinh Xinh Cafe, I must say it was impressive. I had the garlic beef banh mi sandwich and it was love at first bite. It was full of flavor and very filling. I ended up coming in the next day for the pho and again was impressed with the dish. The owner, Shai, remembered me from the previous day too. That is points in my book. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place."

      "Absolutely tasty! \u00a0TONS of vegetarian options, including specials, the bahn mi is SO tasty, but so is the stir fry and the pho! \u00a0The vegan fish sauce it awesome, I always ask for a little cup to dip my sandwich in. \u00a0The puddings (only $1) are a tasty little treat to end the meal. \u00a0All around great place to get a bite!", 
      "Let me start out by saying, I started my Pho life at one of the best Pho restaurants in the nation, which makes me have really high standards. After moving to CU I need a pho fix and I thought Xinh xihn would do the trick but it left much to be desired. The Pho broth itself was weak and sweet. The condiments that are served with Pho (sawtooth herb, bean sprouts, lime, basil) were skimpy at best. The meat was tough and bland. The fish sauce they served was some of the worst fish sauce I've ever had and they had no clue what Chinese black vinegar was. The service was average as was the atmosphere. I will be looking else where for my pho fix.Didn't try the sandwiches, but not sure if I'm willing to go back and try them.", 
      "This place was absolutely horrible. We had the lemongrass chicken noodle salad and the chicken didn't even look like chicken. I was very disappointed. I can only imagine how the other food must have been.", 
      "Had some banh mi, and it was pretty yummy. \u00a0Not my concept of authentic, but quite good.", 
      "I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was on a recent trip here. Spring rolls were very nice and crispy, the mung bean pudding was rich and flavorful, Banh Mi had a good mix of flavors and textures with excellent bread, and the vermicelli bowls had fresh vegetables, perfectly cooked meat, and generous portions. I'll definitely be back since the prices are great as well.", 
      "Nice atmosphere, but the food is just ok. \u00a0Not exactly authentic Vietnamese. \u00a0We tried the pho and Thai fish cake sandwich. \u00a0We also had beef skewers - a Cambodian dish. \u00a0We didn't like the beef skewers at all, the marinade had a sour note. \u00a0The pho was salty but not really aromatic. \u00a0My sandwich had good bread and meat, but the condiments weren't right, especially the pickled vegetables. \u00a0They were too sweet and not traditional. \u00a0They also topped it off with a sweet and sour sauce, which was a bit odd. \u00a0For dessert, we shared the fried bananas. \u00a0I believe they used unripened bananas, so they were firm but not sweet at all.", 
      "This is a great spot for some delicious and affordable food. . I like the sandwiches and the pho. Also try the rice pudding!",

      "First, I have to say that before I came to this restaurant, I had already heard that it was a great place for authentic Vietnamese food. So, I am sure that this mindset affected this review. But regardless, carry on and read!I came here with one other friend on a weekday evening. The place was pretty hard to find even though we got directions and it turned out to be a small area right next to a big Schnuck's. The area made it seem like a small step above one of those 'hole-in-the-wall' restaurants, but when going inside it is actually very clean and cozy. My friend and I both had the pho that had bascially of the meats in it (which, you'll know when you read the descriptions on the menu, but I forget the name). It was really nice on a cold night and really filling for a good price! Overall, the experience was great. The food, atmosphere, and waiters were great. The only thing that would deter me from going again would be the location - it's too far away from campustown!!", 
      "Taste is good and service is nice. \u00a0Indigents not very fresh. \u00a0Too expensive for too little food though.", 
      "Absolutely something you cannot miss in Champaign-Urbana.", 
      "First visit to Xinh Xinh today for lunch. \u00a0I ordered the rice vermicelli with chicken and peanut and a spring roll. Food was delicious but the service left something to be desired. \u00a0We had to wait quite awhile for someone to take our order, and no one ever came to ask how everything was or to refill our drinks. \u00a0I wish I had ordered an appetizer or side dish because, while what I had was delicious, it was not quite filling. \u00a0I will be back again when I am in the mood for good Vietnamese food.", 
      "This is one of my favorite places to eat at in CU. Great, friendly service, excellent food, good prices. I usually get the tofu vermicelli, its awesome. I've also had the tofu bahn mi, and summer rolls, both really tasty! This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but its great!", 
      "Decent pho, although that relies on your personal ability to use the ingredients to season it properly. \u00a0I'd have liked a more well seasoned pho to start with.", 
      "Pho tai and spring roll were pretty good:)", 
      "After reading so many rave reviews this place, I was a bit skeptical on my first visit a couple of weeks ago. \u00a0I was also slightly intimidated, as I'd never had Vietnamese-American food before -- a glaring omission in my culinary education -- but the concepts of meat and veggies on a baguette and noodle soup are so deeply ingrained into my consciousness that I was excited to try a different cultural twist on the familiar. \u00a0I was absolutely not disappointed; I tried the banh mi (#2) and my dining companion had pho, and we were both incredibly happy eaters. \u00a0The owner was personable and very excited about his food -- his passion for what he does is obvious both in conversation and simply in dining. \u00a0The only negative part of the meal was our server, a surly woman who toed the line of outright rudeness throughout our visit. \u00a0Nonetheless, I intend to go back tonight, and often in the future. \u00a0Crappy service doesn't even begin to phase me with food this good.", 
      "I've eaten here a handful of times, but must say I have mixed feelings. The owner and employees are very friendly. But I was a bit dissapointed with the beef skewers and the sandwiches with the lemongrass beef. The problem was the beef itself. The chunks were very fatty and full of gristle. In some cases, I couldn't even eat certain sections, as they were just too fatty and gristly. I mentioned this to the owner and he said that they use \"marbled\" beef. In other words, fatty beef. Other than that, the things I had there were pretty decent. But it could definitely be better.", 
      "Xinh Xinh is where I go whenever I'm missing the amenities and diverse cuisine of home (L.A). Shai, who also hails from L.A., does a great job in bringing some good, cheap Vietnamese food to a town that has a limited selection of tasty and fairly authentic ethnic foods beyond the few Chinese gems I've found. Though its definitely not quite like going to Little Saigon in Santa Ana, Xinh Xinh offers some really tasty food. Their pho is really good, though definitely smaller than the ones I've had at home, and their Vermicelli bowls are also super tasty. I'm especially fond of the egg rolls that go into the Vermicelli bowls, which are really different from the ones I've had at home. I've also had some of their rice dishes which are excellent.One of my favorite things though on their menu is their Nataing, or ground pork(?) in coconut milk. It is really different and sooo yummy with the chips that they use which crackle when you put the Nataing over them.The service is always great, and Shai the owner is super-friendly and accommodating. I always go early on Wednesdays because it's a hole in the wall place and gets busy for Happy Hour Pho, but even without the Wednesday discount the food is always still well worth its price.", 
      "My boyfriend and I were looking forward to this restaurant since it received four out of five stars on yelp. We ordered vegetable egg rolls and two bowls of pho. 1) The vegetable egg rolls were overly oily and the owner gave us sweet and sour sauce instead of the usual fish sauce that we normally get at other Vietnamese restaurants. But that wasn't the real issue...the biggest issue came from...2) Pho: Out of all the authentic Vietnamese restaurants we have been to (several at Argyle in Chicago and other places outside of Chicago-NY, VA), this place was by far the worst. First, the soup was too bland that we had to put in a lot of sriracha and hoison sauce -- normally, at other places we've been to, the soup would not need any seasoning because of the already flavorful beef broth (in other words, it was optional to put in the sauce but in this case, even with the additional sauce, the soup was still bad). Noodles were not fully cooked and after a few bites, we gave up. 3) Price: For some odd reason, they charge fairly high for their dishes. You can have far better tasting pho at other places in Chicago for much cheaper price!All in all, we were very disappointed. Ever since the viet place on Savoy closed, we have been wanting to try other Viet places in Champaign/Urbana. The positive reviews here may have been for other dishes but it is still hard for me to believe that this place received four stars out of five. Usually I can depend on Yelp reviews and they have been fairly consistent with my personal experiences but this definitely was an exception.", 
      "Very, very good food for extremely low prices. The sticky rice pudding is exceptionally good for $1. I like the sandwiches a lot.", 
      "The Best Vietnamese Pho in town. Came here often because it was fast service. The bean sprouts and cilantro leaves was always fresh. Broth was clean and flavorful. Definitely a place to check out if you are into pho. The owner is from Cali so I knew at that point that he knows how good pho tastes.", 
      "This is one of my favorite Thai place on campus (after Golden wok) They have a special pho on wednesday for $5 but I haven't gone yet so i'm not quite sure how it is. But their regular pho is pretty good and the portion is pretty big. I really like their summer rolls (the meat is very good). Not a big fan of their bahmi sandwiches but I think i've been spoiled by the north side chicago bahmi sandwiches. Another dish that I really like is their tofu dish, it comes with a lot of things and soup and it's very cheap and affordable so definitely worth a try. I will definitely try going on wednesdays for the pho. Oh the actual restaurant is very small and since I came in with just one other people, they always make us sit in these tiny tables along the wall that barely fits all our dishes. Also, you have to bring the check up to pay so don't just wait there waiting for someone to take ur credit card", 
      "5 star for Chambana, maybe 4 star in general.You would be hard-pressed to find better banh mi in Chambana, though that wouldn't be the case up in Chicago.The pho is good, but a bit pricey for the portions. \u00a0I would recommend NOT getting the bubble tea, unless of course you're cool with powdery bubble tea rather than fresh.The reason this earns such a high rating from me is the banh mi sandwiches. \u00a0Relatively cheap and filling and delicious! \u00a0Not the absolute best, but still pretty damn good.", 
      "I love Xinh Xinh Cafe! The tofu banh mi is tasty with a bit of spice and the pho is great! Every weekend they have been serving vegetarian pho and let me tell you I like this even more than the beef pho! The owner is a great guy and a number of times he's come out to our table and asked us how the food was and talked to us. Definitely someone who wants his customers satisfied! Everyone I've taken to Xinh Xinh has really liked it! I recommend checking it out for sure!!!", 
      "Really good pho. Rich and flavorful! If you are on a high fat diet like I am then ask them for a cup of beef fat (they skim it from the beef broth) to add to your soup! Awesome way to keep warm on a winter day.", 
      "Don't really know much about Vietnamese food, but vegetarian Pho was delicious, with tofu,mushrooms, bamboo shoots, etc. So were summer rolls, which were tangier than I've had before, perhaps due to slightly pickled carrots inside. Service at 6 on a Friday evening was prompt and courteous, and everything, from table to floor to restrooms was clan and in good condition.", 
      "Urbana, IL has an embarrassment of good restaurants to choose from, and Xinh Xinh is high on the list. Both the hubster and I are quite fond of Vietnamese food and seek it our wherever we are, so we ate here twice during our 3 day stay. First, I really like the space, which, with its' corrugated metal walls and local art work, manages to be both urban and cozy at the same time. The guy at the counter waits tables, so he sat us, brought us water and served our food, all while taking care of other customers and running the counter very efficiently and with a smile. I had eaten a large lunch, so had the tofu summer rolls, which were great...very fresh veggies and marinated tofu, with a crunchy fried component in the center that added textural interest, served with a tasty hoisin-peanut sauce. When I looked around I noticed many other folks had ordered those tofu summer rolls, so they're very popular. I also ordered the chicken dumplings, which were excellent...tasty little fried morsels served with a sweet fish sauce dipping sauce. Doug had the bun (vermicelli rice noodle bowl) with chicken and an extra fried spring roll and said it was great...noodles a little thicker than the average that looked homemade and well marinated chicken, served with a sauce that he thought too sweet initially, but then warmed up to. Xinh Xinh has a wide range of beverages choices, from bubble teas to Vietnamese sodas, hot tea, an avocado shake, Thai iced tea, coconut juice, and that most delicious of beverages, Vietnamese drip coffee sweetened with condensed milk...rich and sweet yumminess. We had the banh mi on our second visit, which is the traditional Vietnamese baguette sandwich. We tried the roast pork pate combo and the pepper chicken, and they were both good, but not stellar. I admit to being a little spoiled by the banh mi at Dong Phuong in New Orleans, which have ruined the experience for me anywhere else. We didn't try the pho, as we don't eat beef and they don't offer the chicken variety, although they do have a vegetarian pho on the menu. I like the thought they put into everything here, from the fresh ingredients to the cute decor. They even have their own little hand drawn character...the Pho King Man...keep in mind that \"pho\" is pronounced \"fu\" and then say it out loud. You'll get it.", 
      "I love this place. The food seems very authentic. I dont know for sure because I'm not vietnamese. I loved it. Very natural and flavorful. Can't wait to go again.", 
      "I would give their special banh mi (with extra jalapenos) 5 stars. \u00a0I also like their vermicelli dishes. \u00a0But their pho? \u00a0Phoggedaboutit. \u00a0It's basically warm water that you season with hoisin sauce, sriracha sauce, and your own tears as you pine for the soul-warming bowl of pho that's not in front of you.", 
      "excellent pho and dumplings-we come at least 1-2 times a week for the pho. the bubble tea was fine but you have to tell them that you want milk in it or that you want it blended with ice. other than that its a cute place with super quick service and very friendly people.", 
      "I've generally had a great experience here, good pho, spring rolls, and vermicelli. The specialty drinks are hit and miss depending on the day. \u00a0The chicken wings are something to pass up though. I was served undercooked wings, one of which was the joint between the throwaway wing tip and flat part of the wing. The individual working there at the time was quite rude when I complained, raising her voice and complaining about how much makes and the economy. \u00a0This experience ruined my overall impression since I used to really talk up the place in a positive light.", 
      "I was happy to find a place that made banh mi in this town. \u00a0I've tried about half of all the different types, and my favorite is still the black pepper chicken. \u00a0The vegetables are fresh and crisp, the jalapeno is spicy, and it is a really refreshing sandwich. \u00a0The pho is also good, the vermicelli is better (personal preference). \u00a0I'm excited about the 5 dollar vermicelli Monday lunch specials!", 
      "1- love their boba. we've tried the milk tea and the green tea... pretty amazing.2- love their banh mi! anyone who caters to the vegetarians (tofu! fake meat! YUM!) gets an A+. 3- the owner (and his mom) are the sweetest. overall, professional, courteous, and incredibly tasty food."

      "Best cupcakes I've had hands down.", 
      "I usually bake my own desserts, but on occasion I will buy cupcakes from Cream & Flutter. The first time I had one of their chocolate cupcakes, I was surprised because the frosting reminded me of chocolate ice cream. I've also had one of their large macaroons and it was very tasty.", 
      "Nothing too surprising here.....cupcakes are tasty and the store is really cute but a bit pricy (approx. $3.50 each and no price break for 3 dozen:(There are so many similar cupcakes joints and I'm waiting for one of them to do something super special...like sell a giant cupcake for 2 for the same price. Standard cupcakes are too small for all that buttery frosting but they are good...I like more cake, less frosting which may not be the most popular.", 
      "I came and ordered their pistachio macaroon, velvet cupcake and chocolate mousse cupcake, all of which were simply too sweet. Being sweet is not necessarily a problem, but ither than that, there was nothing else. Was quite disappointed. However, their customer service wad pretty good, hence the two stars.", 
      "When you walk into the store it can be intimidating at first, because everything seems so high end and kind of expensive. But the cupcakes are delicious. They have unique flavors that change everyday, so that was pretty cool. Overall, the atmosphere is cute and relaxing. The decorations are really beautiful here. There isn't a lot of places to sit though, so that's the downside if you don't want it to-go.", 
      "When it comes to desserts, cupcakes are pretty low on my list. Ice cream is the best, obviously, followed by other frozen treats. Even donuts are higher than cupcakes.So, when someone suggests cupcakes I usually roll my eyes and recommend we get ice cream instead. Usually I win, but not this time.Anyways, I had a dark chocolate cupcake that was easily the best I've ever had. The cake was incredibly moist and the frosting was really really light, like a mix of butter cream and whipped cream. I loved it.My friend had the vanilla bean and I didn't really like it. Heavy sugary frosting with normal cake texture.At $7 for two little cupcakes, the prices are really high. You could buy a lot of ice cream with $7!", 
      "The feel of this place is great-the decor is really trendy and cute, and I like how it's open late. \u00a0I got the dark chocolate cupcake and thought that it was just okay. \u00a0The frosting and cake were both too light for me--I couldn't really taste the dark chocolate. \u00a0I've had much better cupcakes from Sprinkles in Chicago. \u00a0Plus, this cupcake was pretty expensive considering how small it is.I'd probably go here with friends again if we were in downtown Champaign looking for something to do. \u00a0But otherwise, I wouldn't bother.", 
      "A bakery that does not open until 11:30 on a Saturday. \u00a0I don't get it.", 
      "Peanut butter and chocolate cupcakes, nuff said! This really is a quaint little lovely bakery. I have not had a cupcake or cookie I did not like from here. Priced fairly too!", 
      "The first time I came here was when this place was still called Cakes on Walnut. I absolutely love their red velvet cupcakes! The cream cheese frosting is very light and it does not feel like you're gonna get a hear attack. I'm from Chicago and there are tons of cupcake places around here, but I would say that Cream & Flutter is no doubt on the top of my list. Aside from cupcakes, their macarons is pretty good too. Sometimes it can feel as if you're digesting a lot of butter from the butter cream, but it's pretty darn good. I love macarons and even though they're made to be bite size, you won't regret purchasing it. They also have a variety of coffee and tea selection. Very versatile dessert place. Every time I make a visit to champaign, getting a cupcake from here is a MUST.", 
      "Love their HUGE pinwheel macarons ranging from strawberry, vanilla bean, passionfruit, hazelnut, and pistachio! The buttercream filling for macarons and cupcakes is the best ive ever tasted-- creamy with a hint of sweetness (unlike the overwhelming sweetness of most buttercreams. I want to steal their buttercream recipe!", 
      "Kinda expensive, but very delicious cupcakes! They also have a lot of nice sweets. Definitely a nice place to spend with your friends during the afternoon.", 
      "Had a chocolate cupcake with chocolate frosting and a red velvet. The chocolate was rich and the frosting was perfect not too sweet. The red velvet cake was moist and flavorful but the frosting was a little too sweet for my taste. These were very good cupcakes but were quite expensive at $3.19 for a normal standard size .", 
      "I really enjoyed the blue raspberry and Apple Bon bons, but I wasn't a fan of the macaroon. It wasn't what I was expecting. It was light and fluffy, but the favors were off for me. The service was great and the staff were very friendly. I would go again.", 
      "I just moved here about 4 months ago and I had a cupcake store I really loved back in Austin, and I had been craving it so thought I'd give it a try for Valentine's Day. \u00a0My husband picked up 2 red velvet cupcakes and brought them home. \u00a0The icing was really good, very creamy, soft and light, not overly sweet but very rich. \u00a0The cake was good but didn't knock my socks off like my old place. \u00a0I really felt like the price for that size of cupcake was too much. \u00a0I would expect them to be the big cupcakes for what they are charging. \u00a0I may go back to try one of the more specialty flavors, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. \u00a0My husband said the store itself seemed very trendy.", 
      "This place is overrated. I still don't know why they changed the name but what I do know is that the quality of their products changed as well and not in a good way. There needs to be a larger variety of goods. The cupcakes are smaller and cost more. Wtf?? Additionally the cupcakes were stale and dense. Dunno if they were from the day before? Disappointed with the quality of the confections. Hopefully things improve...", 
      "MAKE CUPCAKES, NOT WAR. \u00a0That's what the employee's shirt said. \u00a0I wanted it. Cakes is open at 7 am every morning. \u00a0The interior has trendy hardwood floors and white tables and chairs. \u00a0Note you can also get Capogiro gelato and cocktails(!) here.The Aztec chocolate cupcake had decent choc cake and some red-hot-cinnamon-chili taste to the frosting, which was marshmallow-fluff-like in texture. \u00a0The cake in the cinnamon blood orange (cinnamon flavored) and margarita (lime flavored) cupcakes was okay, but the frosting on both had a waxy, almost foamy texture. \u00a0Not my cup of tea... or cup of cake. \u00a0I didn't finish the frosting, and I NEVER never finish the frosting!", 
      "Over priced and under delicious. \u00a0Went on a Saturday afternoon, and the cupcakes tasted a little stale by the time I ate them 20 mins later! \u00a0They didn't really seem of \"cupcake shop\" quality, more just box mix with buttercream frosting on top.Good creativity with flavors, I'll give them that!", 
      "I have to say, the Cakes on Walnut interior decor is adorable!! It reminds me of the artwork sold at Urban Outfitters- and the bathroom paintings are extremely cute. The place looks really clean, and the staff is very friendly. I think since the last few reviews were written, however, the prices of the cupcakes have gone up. ($3.25 per and $18 for half a dozen). Also as a temporary relocate from the Bay Area, I was expecting a lot more, when I heard of the little cup-cakery. Not that the cupcakes are bad- I just find them extraordinarily...ordinary for the price they are sold at.The cakes are very moist, and light- very normal tasting cupcakes(I had the lemongrass white tea and strawberry something something), which is a stark contrast to the heavy, rich icing on the tops. Its worth a try just for the atmosphere and friends, but the actual cakes dont really do it for me at $3.25 per.", 
      "If I could, my review would be a 2.5My husband and I visited Cakes on Walnut on a Saturday around 2. \u00a0 We were going to go eat lunch at Radio Maria, but wanted to stop here first (in case they closed before we got done). \u00a0When we saw they offered lunch, we decided to eat there. \u00a0So, for $25- we got 2 sandwiches, a cupcake, a brownie, a root beer and a diet pepsi. \u00a0NOW, the sandwiches were made with local ingredients, which is fantastic, and makes me willing to pay more. \u00a0I had chicken salad- it was ok. \u00a0Husband had the mozzarella pesto tomato panini- it was also ok. \u00a0 \u00a0Red velvet cupcake was ok. \u00a0Chocolate nubs on top were not....they were bitter and not good. \u00a0 \u00a0Husband really enjoyed his brownie.The rip on the rating? \u00a0Yea, that would be the staff. \u00a0The girl who waited on us was fine. \u00a0One of the owners was there, though, and she didn't even smile. \u00a0No thank, nothing. \u00a0I own a small business...I expect more, I suppose. \u00a0But if two new people, from out of town come into your business and drop $25 on some lunch, a thank you is nice. \u00a0Or a smile. \u00a0Or something.", 
      "First - if you needed another reason to enjoy cupcakes - Cakes on Walnut makes an effort to be green about their indulgences; they encourage patrons to bring in their own containers for take-away cupcakes and offer a discount to those who do. Now, the cupcake selection itself was a touch limited. This past Saturday there was only one (\"confetti\" - their take on the Pillsbury classic \"funfetti\") that wasn't chocolate or pumpkin. One white-cake crowded by chocolate, chocolate lavender, black and white, and red velvet (chocolate cake died red). Um, variety is the spice of life? At least they offer variety in the size of the cupcakes (mini to large). But the coffee!! Three cheers for French Press Coffee! You get to take the whole little tureen back to your table to enjoy at your leisure (one french press contains about 4 cups of coffee). As true coffee connoisseurs will agree, the tastiest coffee comes from french presses. Overall, the place is adorable and clearly beloved as it was nonstop busy throughout our stay. I will definitely be back on my next trip to downtown Champaign.", 
      "This rating is not about the cupcakes...because I didn't get to have any. Aside from seeing my fabulous friends, this place was what I was most looking forward to on my trip to the area. I've heard about the yummy treats for a while now, and was SO excited to get to go.So, post dinner and hockey game on Saturday night, we waltzed down Walnut...just in time to see the shop being locked up. Whaaaa? I(well, \u00a0we ALL) were expecting late night goodies at a place known for late night hours. Evidently, Cakes on Walnut has recently changed their hours, and alas, are now not the \"post bar\" go-to. No biggie, we'll just stop back tomorrow. Errr, wait. \u00a0Closed on Sundays. Hmmm...Monday, before we leave??? No dice. They don't open 'till Noon. Boo Hiss. Perhaps if I'm ever in town and get to taste these cakes, I can actually rate them. *I'm giving them two stars, because only \u00a0Funky-McNasty places with bad service get one star in my book(which I don't think would describe this place)...but my bummed out sweet tooth thinks I'm a softie.", 
      "I suppose that I'm a pretty simple person, in that what I've paid ordinarily for the ingredients for a batch of cupcakes is roughly the same price as one cupcake here. \u00a0Cakes on Walnut is the latest in a series of trendy food spots where one can have the pleasure of overpaying for pretty simple treats. \u00a0Perhaps, though, it may no longer be the latest; fashion is fickle. \u00a0That said, it was with great curiosity that I dove into the wild world of designer cupcakeries. \u00a0Studies have shown that merely being told a bottle of wine is expensive makes it taste better; so perhaps it would follow with cupcakes as well?Cakes on Walnut is located in a cozy part of \"downtown\" Champaign, nestled in the neighborhood of Jane Addams, Dandelion, and The Blind Pig. \u00a0A rather hip part of town, I'm told. \u00a0The shop is inviting; a large front window allows you to catch a faint sight of the delicious morsels awaiting you. \u00a0Not to mention that the smell of cupcakes almost demands that you enter, if for no other reason than to bask in the cupcake smell. \u00a0The inside of the shop is rather nondescript, tables and chairs, nice and minimalist. \u00a0I appreciate that, although I do wonder if it was done as an aesthetic choice at times. \u00a0The real life in the shop seems to spring from the brightly colored cupcakes beckoning you from behind the counter. \u00a0No shier from temptation, I chose the lemon cupcake, a sweet vanilla cupcake with lemon frosting and what I believe were LemonHeads inside the frosting. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0My girlfriend got the salted caramel cupcake, so I was able to try two cupcakes for one visit.My impression was... whelmed. \u00a0Both cupcakes were rather delicious, though they were essentially just mountains of frosting heaped on top this fragile little cake. \u00a0The cake itself was not very memorable. \u00a0I'm not sure whether to attribute this to the frosting overload or just that the cake is, well, nondescript. \u00a0But there it is.So, would I recommend it? \u00a0I certainly wouldn't dissuade you from visiting. \u00a0The frosting is pretty delicious. \u00a0But really, that's just it. \u00a0If you're willing to spend a little time getting messy, and a few minutes googling \"cupcake recipes,\" I might just tell you to save your money and just make your own cupcakes. \u00a0At least you'll get more than one.", 
      "I have been in C o W several times with friends. \u00a0On my second visit with friends I tried the Red Velvet cupcake. \u00a0It was dry and the frosting was waxy and stiff, more for decoration than eating. \u00a0I did not finish it but gave it to a friend and she had the same comment. \u00a0Very expensive for what you get, this is not Chicago. \u00a0 \u00a0I agree with a previous review that you are paying mostly for the snappy decor. \u00a0I will go in with friends but I never purchase anything there.Selection very limited. \u00a0The small cupcakes are VERY small and \u00a0overpriced at $2.75 each for basically 2 bites. \u00a0Similar reviews on Tripadvisor.", 
      "The cupcakes need work. If they're using all natural & local ingredients, you should refine your recipe around this concept before you sell them. I give them a 3/10 for cupcake quality because it was dry and so small for the price. Also -- a 1/10 for owner professionalism and business ethics. Decor? .... an attempt. This place is only popular for cupcakes in Champaign because there's nothing else around here. Nice try.", 
      "Being a non-C-U native yet someone who must spend a good portion of her life in the area, I've come to know many of the dining establishments in both the C and the U side of town. \u00a0Like so many other transplants, I find my emotions about dining in Champaign-Urbana range between two: either desperate for something decent or disappointed that yet another place stunk. \u00a0If you are looking for anything beyond a chain experience (Biaggi's, Chili's, Panera, etc.) the few diamonds in the rough are hard to come by.Couple this with the fact that cupcakeries have sprung up across the country in the past few years like a blight, with little to no quality control or easy way to distinguish the good from the bad, and my concern about Cakes on Walnut was already piqued before even sampling their offerings. But that concern quickly evaporated after my first visit, and now Cakes is a must-stop for me, as I am expected to walk through the door in the city in which I reside with a box of the latest cupcakes from Champaign. Cakes delivers on its name by offering eight varieties of cupcakes each day, ranging from the staple (vanilla; red velvet) to the exciting (smore; limoncello). \u00a0Contrary to what a couple of other reviewers have said, these cakes do _not_ taste like a mix, but taste and are homemade - you can watch the process go down in the open kitchen area, if you like. \u00a0The frosting is delectable, although you will have a hard time avoiding wiping a fair amount of it on your nose as you attempt to eat it.The ambiance is nice and charming, hand-painted with a swallow motif on the wall and cute, modern interior. \u00a0The bar is a nice touch and great place to enjoy a cupcake with a glass of milk or French press coffee. \u00a0The staff are friendly and warm and don't mind if you nurse your single cupcake for awhile, or grab them to go.Cakes on Walnut is one of the few truly special food destinations in C-U and one of the few whose reputation crosses the city limits. \u00a0I am a fan.", 
      "Holy sugar high Batman! \u00a0This place is a great place to stop for a dessert after lunch or dinner in Downtown Champaign and now that the weather is warming up should be a great place to hang out on the patio. \u00a0I had the vanilla cupcake with the most amazing icing EVER! \u00a0The cake itself was pretty dry (I like a more dense, moist cake and cupcake) but the icing had me making inappropriate noises in the middle of the afternoon! \u00a0The decor is definitely Ikea-chic and the seating is not designed for comfortable conversation, but the DT Champaign hipsters in there on their laptops didn't seem to mind. \u00a0The other major negative was $2 for a glass of milk. \u00a0Talk about profit margin.....I can get a GALLON of milk at Aldi for $1.99 (and I'm guessing the owners of Cakes do too!). \u00a0Overall though, not a bad place, and I'll definitely swing by for a grab and go during my next stop in Chambana.", 
      "I'd give this spot a 3.5 stars, if that were possible. \u00a0The cupcakes are pretty darn good. \u00a0Choc oatmeal stout was best yet and tiramisu close second.They have tasty coffee drinks but no soymilk options. \u00a0Not a place for the vegans, at all. \u00a0The smoked duck panini was totally bomb.", 
      "EDIT:I heard that some improvements had been made, so I went back and gave it another try. \u00a0This time, it was fabulous. \u00a0The cakes were moist, tender, and really tasty. \u00a0Prices still high, but this time it seemed worth it. \u00a0They have lowered the prices for a dozen cupcakes and dropped the box charge. \u00a0They also took cereal off the menu.Minus 1 star because of the prices and because the gelato that comes with the $6 pairing wasn't that great. \u00a0The serving was also really small. \u00a0I'll skip the gelato and stick with a cupcake and a nice glass of milk when I go back. \u00a0I'd also prefer a sweeter, less greasy frosting, but that's a personal taste thing and It's probably not fair to fault them for my personal preference.Overall, I was very impressed with the changes. \u00a0It made for a really nice evening to sit at the outdoor bar and enjoy a great cupcake on a warm spring evening, and I look forward to doing so again soon.*******I REALLY wanted to love this place. \u00a0I went in a few days after they opened and was disappointed to see that they are very overpriced. \u00a0But I didn't let that get me down. \u00a0I figured the prices must be reflective of the quality, and I got ready to sample what I expected would be some phenomenal cupcakes. \u00a0To my dismay, these expensive cupcakes are really not that good. \u00a0The few I brought home for everyone to sample were extremely dry and bland. \u00a0The texture reminded me of the free hunk of cake you get for your birthday at cheesy chain restaurants.I'd had very high hopes for the salted caramel, but there was no hint of salt and the caramel element tasted like sugar that had been burnt, not caramelized. \u00a0The Red Velvet had a hint of cream cheese flavor in the frosting, but wasn't very sweet and had no chocolate flavor. \u00a0The high point was the strawberry balsamic, which was a nice combination of flavors but, like the others, very poorly executed. \u00a0It was really just a plain, dry, flavorless cupcake with some pretty decent strawberry frosting (which I actually liked very much) and a drizzle of thick vinegar. \u00a0Overall though, I'm sorry to report that \u00a0I've had better cupcakes from a box.Speaking of boxes, if you want one to carry your cupcakes home in, It'll cost you $1. \u00a0With as much as they're charging for the cupcakes, you'd think they'd give you something to carry them home in. \u00a0Nope. \u00a0That's extra. \u00a0Insult to injury, if you will.I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again in a few months to give them a chance to get into the swing of things and, with any luck, turn out a better cupcake. \u00a0My hope is that the strawberry balsamic frosting is an indicator of a potential that they will reach once they get past the first few weeks. \u00a0Unfortunately, I don't know that they'll be around in a few months and I'm also not sure that I'd be willing to pay their insane prices even if the cupcakes were to improve substantially.", 
      "Here I go being unpopular again, but I just was not impressed. Cream & Flutter just did not live up to the hype. Full disclosure: I don't get this cupcake thing. I see it on TV where these goofy people are making these cupcakes and having cupcake wars and shit. In going to Cream & Flutter, I was going to \"get\" this cupcake craze. After eating a decent chocolate cupcake that cost me $3.25, I'm kind of even more so in head scratching mode. At some level, I get it. I want use these local, natural ingredients but if that's the case, I want to taste that. Maybe I'm super entry level here, but I'd rather go to Meijer, buy a box of Funfetti (which is awesome), use the secret tips from one of my coworkers on what to add to spruce up Funfetti and make my own frosting. I could make a dozen for about six bucks.But y'all do you. If you got the cash money to drop 3 bones on a decent cupcake that you could probably make yourself if you tried hard enough, more power to you.", 
      "Good Things:-My \"Pistachio Passion Fruit\" cupcake. \u00a0The cupcake was good and all, but it was the passion fruit whipped topping adorned with crunchy, salty pistachios that pushed it over the edge into Amazingville. \u00a0At $2.50, I'm more than sold.-The \"Lemongrass Pear\" cocktail. \u00a0They use Grey Goose vodka, which, at $7/cocktail, is a nice deal. \u00a0It was a wonderful drink--refreshing and just a little sugary. \u00a0Very complementary to my cupcake, too.-The plates they use are beyond adorable.Meh Things:-Raspberry Dessert Wine. \u00a0Sounds good, but isn't. \u00a0It's like drinking sweetened cough syrup.-The \"Mexican Hot Chocolate\" cupcake was good, but wasn't on the same plane of existence as the pistachio cupcake. \u00a0The cake itself tasted like a snickerdoodle cookie, and the whipped topping tasted mostly like cinnamon. \u00a0It wasn't bad, but I think The Boy was looking more for chocolate and less for cinnamon.-They had one person working the counter at 8 on a Friday night. \u00a0It was probably about as busy as Cakes on Walnut gets....why only one person? \u00a0She was taking orders, making drinks, getting the cupcakes, and just about everything else. \u00a0As a result, there was a lot of wait time involved for people in line, and tables were not bussed properly.-The ambiance was a bit iffy. \u00a0It was like...trying to be pretentious and indie-quirky all at the same time. All told, though, I'm a fan. \u00a0Next time I'll skip buying the booze and go next door to the Blind Pig, have a lot of beer, and then go get some delicious, inexpensive cupcakes. \u00a0To go.", 
      "It is the local cupcakery and they do a pretty good job. The store is adorable and always love going inside and enjoying a cupcake over chit chat with friends. The only reason I rate them with a 3 is they usually only have 4-5 different cupcakes to choose from on any given day and they are a tad expensive for the area - many Chicago based cupcakeries charge equal or less per cupcake.These ladies are off to something great though - I think they would have even more business if they were on the U of I campus", 
      "I just inhaled my first cupcake from this place. \u00a0They just earned a new frequent customer.Very girly store with cupcakes and cocktails, both done expertly. \u00a0Creamy frosting prettily piped onto moist, delicious cupcakes. \u00a0On fridays and saturdays you can swing by for either until 11pm. \u00a0It's right in the center of Champaign downtown, making it perfect for pre-bar, post-dinner, or both on those days.", 
      "On the plus side, the place is adorable. \u00a0A super cute place for date night, if only the desserts were good at, well, night.Yep, I'm going to have to agree with Sonny S. on this one. \u00a0Somewhere around the time the name of this place changed, they stopped selling the larger versions of cupcakes, prices went up, and the cupcakes got drier. \u00a0Is it because they're made earlier in the day and would taste fresher then? \u00a0Maybe. \u00a0But if you're going to stay open late-night (which, by the way, I would think you'd want to because I'm sure you get a lot of foot traffic from the downtown restaurants and bars), for goodness sakes, try to find a way to keep your product tasting fresh! As a side note, I did have a cookies & cream brownie here once and it was fantastic. \u00a0I only wish the cupcakes were on par.", 
      "I rarely ever get anything unhealthy .. but Cream & Flutter cupcakes are my weakness. I love coming here. The ambiance is great. The cupcakes are to die for: right amount of moist, softness, and sweet. The frosting is amaaazing. I dont eat any other cupcakes but Cream&Flutter.", 
      "Hey look...it's a cute little cupcake \"bar\". It will be interesting to see if this is a success. The atmosphere is pleasant, but still looks a little unfinished. At first glance the menu is expensive: $2.50 for a small cupcake and $5 lavender soda. However, it's about the same price as a beer at the Blind Pig, and unlike with the beer, I can go to work after eating the cupcake. The beautifully decorated cupcakes I tried (green tea and salted caramel) were good, but not quite fantastic. I suspect they are still tweaking their recipe. The soda I tried was more like sparkling water with a hint of lavender, so it didn't really satisfy my craving for that flowery taste and I don't think it was worth $5. My friends did get tea though, which came in a beautiful clear teapot with a votive underneath that illuminated the table. I noticed that it's open late, so it might be a good late night snack for after you hit up the nearby hipster bars.", 
      "Hands down the best cupcakes I have ever had, yes, better than Sprinkles. \u00a0Each cupcake is subtly flavored, sweet, but not overpowering, and topped with light cream. \u00a0They also rotate their flavors regularly, and I have never seen the flavors they serve here anywhere else. \u00a0Decor is chic and modern, a bit dim and the perfect place to hang out and chill with friends. \u00a0They also serve delicious teas and mixed drinks...seriously, nothing beats sipping on a martini while eating cupcakes with your girlfriends here.Not someplace I'd come study despite their free wifi, but mainly because why would I want to ruin the Cakes on Walnut experience with something as painful as studying?? \u00a0Definitely one of my favorite places to go when I feel like taking a well-deserved (...or not) break.", 
      "It's a place that serves cupcakes... whaddya want?Is it pricey? \u00a0Yes. \u00a0Is the layout goofy? \u00a0You betcha. \u00a0Too trendy? \u00a0Indeed.But answer me this: do you like cupcakes? \u00a0And I mean REALLY like cupcakes. \u00a0Would you trade your prized bichon frise for the last available, day-old cupcake in the Schnuck's bakery?If the answer to that last question is yes, then do yourself a favor and try these cupcakes. \u00a0You'll spend 5 times as much as you would for a typical cupcake, but you get 100 times the flavor. \u00a0You can't argue with that math!And now they have macaroons!? \u00a0Color me a fan!", 
      "I had previously read articles about the growing popularity of cupcake cafes around the country, so I was excited to see one arrive in Champaign over a year ago. \u00a0Since its opening, I've visited Cakes on Walnut several times to sample the different options and observe the business's growth.This is certainly a prime spot for a date, as the atmosphere is sleek yet cozy. \u00a0I've also always had friendly experiences with the employees during my visits. \u00a0Unfortunately, when it comes to the focus of the store (the cupcakes), I have not always been impressed. \u00a0I've heard that the batter is made with butter rather than oil, so the resulting cupcakes often seem too dry. \u00a0The saving grace of the cakes is the rich and flavorful frosting. \u00a0While other people have written complaints about the frosting being too \"stiff,\" I think the texture is probably largely dependent on how long the cakes have sat on the counter prior to being consumed. \u00a0I tend to agree with criticisms that the price seems a bit unreasonable given the quality of the food.Although the flavors are not entirely ingenious, I \u00a0also do appreciate the attempt to offer some non-traditional cupcakes. \u00a0The shop only offers a handful of flavors each day, but I can usually find one that piques my interest.Overall, Cakes on Walnut is worthy of a visit when you're looking for a special treat, but the price might be too prohibitive otherwise.", 
      "I've only had one cupcake from here, so this is based on very limited experience. But, in my one visit I formed a 3-star opinion. I came in around 9:30 on a Friday night. There were 4-5 cupcake flavors to choose from plus a brownie and maybe three different types of cookies. The setup of the shop is a little weird in that the cupcakes are displayed on the side, so if this place ever got busy and a line formed it would be a little chaotic to see which cupcakes were available and then actually get in line in front of the register. The menu was posted on the wall adjacent to the display case, but I didn't even notice it until I had my cupcake and was sitting down.But those are minor issues. I ordered a vanilla cupcake and took a seat. The cake itself was dry and the cupcake was way overpriced at $2.99 for being so small. The saving grace of my purchase was the icing. It was delicious! The sugar sprinkles on top were a great touch. I'd come here again for a cupcake, but I find the high pricetag really annoying and a major put-off.Cream & Flutter has cocktails in addition to milk, coffee, and tea. This makes me wonder if they are trying to position themselves as a place to hang out instead of a place to go just to wolf down a treat. If the former then the interior needs work. It's a bit stark and the chairs aren't the most comfortable to just sit and relax. A cozier atmosphere would be more conducive to sipping a cocktail and staying there longer. But, again, not sure if that's their goal or not.In short - I'd go back...begrudgingly."

      "So I always hunt down local cupcake shops when I travel for work and this one did not disappoint!My absolute favorite was the pumpkin spice - not too sweet and the frosting was perfect; the pumpkin flavor was really showcased in this cupcake instead of being masked by cinnamon or nutmeg.I also tried the Chocolate Stout - didn't really stand out and I despise places that put those darn cocoa nibs on top - they really are too hard to try to chew and end up ruining any attempt to savor the cupcake flavor. The red velvet was also kinda \"meh\" - the cake was too dense and the frosting was too sugary. Regardless, I will come back to try some more flavors, they have a good thing going here ...", 
      "I used to come here with my husband when he was attending law school at UIUC. It used to be called \"Cupcakes on Walnut\" or something like that, from my not-so-good recollection.At any rate, I always enjoyed the scenery of the place and how cheerful the place seemed to be. The servers were usually attentive and nice. Only on occasion did I ever feel they weren't welcoming. I loved the novelty cupcakes from \"pink lemonade\" to \"s'mores\" - the presentation was always nice and artfully done.It can get rather over crowded, leaving you no room to sit and savor your food. The beverages and other food items were overpriced for the quality put forth. So I don't recommend consuming those. Some cupcakes weren't worth all it was cracked up to be, but for the most part, I give this place two cupcakes up.", 
      "Pleasant service (and my wife says the servers all super cute, an opinion with which I concur).The reviews so far have been a bit harsh given our experience. Our cupcake (salted caramel) was quite good. It could have been a bit more moist, and others have noted this (let's hope the \"Cakes\" staff is reading these).The decor is nice, and the \"open kitchen\" concept works well.With some slight adjustments to their recipe, they could really be a hit. \u00a0The place does have a spartan look right now, but as with everything else I give them the benefit of the doubt and expect they'll make changes or not make it. They've barely been open a week!As for the price, given that this is what they make and virtually all they sell, I think to come in, sit at the counter, eat a cupcake with a glass of water and chat for 15 minutes with a server, $3.25 is hardly enough for them to stay in business. Cupcake vs. latte at $3.25? Cupcake wins. My feeling is that they should perfect the cupcake and keep the price.We'll revisit our review after our next visit in a few weeks.", 
      "Here's a confession. \u00a0I haven't even tried the cupcakes. \u00a0HOWEVER, I have found myself getting to Cakes on Walnut as they open (7am) for the certainty of acquiring one of their delicious Cinnamon Banana Walnut muffins. \u00a0It should be noted that their Blueberry muffins are delicious artful baked goods in their own right, but the Walnut is indeed something to write home about.Said muffin topped off with a french press coffee is the best way I've found to talk myself out of the house in the morning.P.S. Their internet never seems to work but I find you can steal it very reliably from somewhere else.", 
      "We stopped by here a couple of months ago after lunch nearby to satisfy a sweet craving. \u00a0The interior is cute and there are little tables if you want to dine in. \u00a0The cupcakes are obviously pricier than if you made them at home, but not out of the ordinary for a bakery or specialty shop. \u00a0I had the dark chocolate cupcake, which I thought was really good. \u00a0I like sweet frosting and it was sweet and fluffy. \u00a0My only complaint is that I thought it would be a little bigger.I would definitely stop here again when I'm in the area and try another flavor. \u00a0I heard there was a s'mores flavored cupcake, which I'd love to try.", 
      "Cakes on Walnut is a interesting place: fun to grab a snack in the afternoon with friends, as well as a great date-nite stop. The decor is really visually interesting, with high ceilings, spacious seating and cupcake bar seating as well, but plenty of room to move around. What is brilliant about this little place is the gimmick: great cupcakes and alcohol. They have a different assortment of cupcakes everyday, and I have yet to try anything I didn't love but also did not surprise me. The Red Velvets are one of their classics, but the Coconut and Pistachio are spontaneous and amazing. Ideally, you should always try anything seasonally-related. A great perk to the cupcakes is the serving sizes; they have a regular and a petite size of each flavor. This allows you to either try multiple flavors if you cannot decide but have a threshold for sugar, as well adjust according to your appetite. They have a wide selection of wines (red and white), bottled beer and coffee-type drinks to go with the cupcakes depending on what kind of evening you are having.Located on a street filled with nice restaurants and bars, this is a great place to go at nights' end, or if you just need an afternoon pick-me-up. I highly recommend Cakes on Walnut.NOTE: Every year this bakery releases a fund-raising calendar in collaboration with other local merchants for a few dollars. The girls who work there pose with the baked goods and are dressed by local retailers. Also, like many of the cafes in the area, they sponsor local artists by hanging art on their walls for sale. Both are really good ways to support the local professional arts community in Champaign.", 
      "Love this place. \u00a0When I am in town I always stop by.. for several reasons. \u00a0First, I love sitting at the bar and enjoying any of their many great treats. \u00a0The cupcakes are delish and constantly changing, so I am able to try a new kind every time. \u00a0The tea... love it - roobios is the best, it tastes too damn sinful to be tea. \u00a0And even better is the great selection of beer, wine, bubbly and hard booze drinks.It's a great place to meet new peeps, to browse the fun stuff they have for sale and to spend an evening.", 
      "Passing through Champaign and grabbed lunch across the street from here. Couldn't resist stopping in to check out this place. Fantastic decor- feels very high design. The desserts are easy for takout and we grabbed an oreo cookie brownie for the road. It was delicious, and we'll be back for coffee and some more treats on our next trip back through Champaign.", 
      "I recently paid a visit here with a friend and was excited to actually try a cupcake. \u00a0I have purchased cupcakes here before as gifts for friends and family but have never actually tried one myself. \u00a0I really like the atmosphere. \u00a0It's clean and cute and someplace different than the norm. \u00a0In terms of the cupcake itself (I tried a banana cinnamon one), I thought the cake was a little dry but the frosting was light and delicious. \u00a0Presentation of the cakes really helped to increase their edible appeal and I definitely appreciated the variety of new and interesting flavors. \u00a0It's definitely worth the visit and the fact that they continually change the flavors means that you can keep going back and always find something different to try :)", 
      "I stopped by here with a friend while visiting from out of town, and just planned on grabbing a quick coffee... but after looking at all of the cupcakes behind the glass counter, I had to get a chocolate/chocolate. \u00a0I'm definitely not a 'foodie', but this was probably the best cupcake I've ever had... \u00a0(I qualify this statement by admitting that I don't eat a lot of cupcakes unless they say 'Hostess' on the packaging). \u00a0The texture of the frosting was unbelievably light and creamy, and the cake was light and moist. \u00a0And chocolate flavors were a perfect complement with the fresh pressed coffee.I may never eat Hostess cupcakes again. \u00a0Coming from me, that means something.", 
      "Um... yum!I love the freaking red-velvet cupcakes here! I live in Chicago and out of all of the cupcake places here I can say that Sprinkles and Cakes on Walnut \u00a0can definitely compete. I also really like that Champaign is on board with having trendy places like this, especially for the downtown area. It was badly needed and it makes a great spot to go with your girl-friends or on a date for dessert!", 
      "I fell in love with their red velvet a few months back. Then I went back for their white chocolate macadamia nut... \u00a0the cake was tasteless and the frosting was sugary(like always). I couldn't bring myself to finish it.Then I went to a cupcake place back home and their red velvet does not even compare. It was so moist and rich. Ahh now I feel like Cakes on Walnut is a lie.I'll still probably go back to Cakes on Walnut when I'm desperate for fix... or if they start throwing in a glass of milk for free.", 
      "Eh, it's okay. It's a boutique cupcake store, and though I don't share the abject hatred of the concept that one of my friends does (I can hear him scream about cupcakes and special treatment even when he's 3,000 miles away), it's rather expensive for desserts that are only pretty good.The red velvet cupcakes are really good, and the ice cream's not bad either, but you need to get there early. We'll stop by after going to dinner at Seven Saints, and it'll be wiped out. It's nice every once in a while if they have the right cupcakes, but not something that I'll miss when I leave Champaign.", 
      "I agree with Victoria C... Cakes is not overpriced. Whenever good ingredients are used, the price goes up, so if you are into mass-produced Walmart cupcakes, then yeah, it might seem pricey.I find the small cupcake is big enough for dessert... but then again I always feel guilty about dessert!I am a huge fan of their constantly changing flavors, their awesome decor, the wine list, the cool staff and the location.", 
      "Being a small cupcake place in Downtown Champaign instead of a bustling city, I can understand why some reviewers might have received stale cupcakes. But when my friend and I went, I remember delicious cupcakes, both frosting and cake. Most memorable: 1. coconut2. pink lemonadeGood cupcakes if you're lucky to get fresh ones =]", 
      "I don't get the complaints about needing to have a billion different varieties of cupcakes. How many exactly are you all planning to eat?In my case... we ordered 1 of each... and at 8pm on a Saturday, that equaled 5 different flavors. I assume that the cupcakes aren't continuously baked throughout the day/night, so ours weren't perfectly fresh... however, most of them were still delightful. Chocolate hazelnut was by far my favorite. Red velvet letft a little to be desired (the frosting was fabulous though). You can also get ice cream, if your heart desires.I also love the decor of this place. Much like the frosting on many of our cupcakes, the atmosphere is light and fluffy. Very bright, lots of light, flowing fabric draping the walls/ceiling. It's a cute place. Super mega fun bonus... alcohol is served! You can enjoy your cupcakes with wine, beer...and I believe a limited selection of mixed drinks. I assume this given that I saw a few bottles of vodka on the wall. Unless there's a secret vodka cupcake recipe I don't know about (maybe that's the magic!), I'm assuming you can get a drink with that too.", 
      "Honestly, the cupcakes are not that good and it's way over priced for how small they are. I would much rather get the brownies which are delicious. The decor is very nice and there are outlets around if you want to study there, however not too sure about wifi. The staff are very nice and friendly. Parking is a little difficult in this area so come prepared with quarters and patience", 
      "The chocolate chip cookies are phenomenal - definitely try! As for the cupcakes, there are some that are pure win and others that are a flop. If you like exotic, you might like the honey and lavender cupcake but for me, it just tasted like lavender perfume - barf. However, the chocolate and vanilla flavors are excellent. The boyfriend is a huge red velvet fan and by his standards, it's good.I don't understand the name change - I thought Cakes on Walnut was super cute and they could have sold the same stuff without an issue. Yes, they're a tad pricey, considering they are on par with cupcake prices in NYC. Otherwise, it's nice to have a local place to go for a quick cupcake pick-me-up.", 
      "I had the ice cream sandwich here and it was the best I have ever had. There were two homemade chocolate chip cookies with their house- made vanilla ice cream in the center. Absolutely divine on a hot day! The space was very cute and the service was great.", 
      "When this little shop opened, I lived close to downtown and probably went in for cupcakes 3 times a week. They were cute, original, and most importantly delicious! There were two different sizes of cupcakes, and the flavors were always changing and improving. The girls who ran the shop were friendly and helpful, and I just loved going in to see what was new.Unfortunately, over the last year or two this place has started to slip. They changed their name to Cream & Flutter, and it seems the name change has brought them nothing but bad luck. They did away with their larger cupcakes, leaving only standard size. That wouldn't be so bad, but these standard sized cupcakes are now being sold for what the larger ones used to run (over $3 with tax). Along with the increased price for less product, as some others have mentioned, the products aren't fresh! This store stays open until 9 PM, but doesn't make products to accommodate that time frame. They are either out of cupcakes or the cupcakes are stale. Eventually I stopped going after 3 PM.It seems that this shop has started focusing on being \"cool\" and emulating cupcakers on Food Network more than on quality product. Sure, they sell lots of cutesy candies and nice looking cupcakes, but everything is overpriced and I could easily make the same thing at home. If you've got a Pinterest, you can make comparable cupcakes. The only reason I go in anymore is for their absolutely amazing brownies, but sadly those are also starting to decrease in size and increase in price.I've always loved this shop, but they need to revert back to some of their older ways to keep some of their old customers! Go back to Cakes on Walnut!", 
      "As it is well documented, I don't care for the name change either. Actually, there is only one thing that I really like here. I have had several cupcakes here, attempting to give it multiple chances, but I have finally made my conclusion. They have some of the best icing that I have every had. Light, flavorful, creamy, and amazing. Unfortunately, I don't think that their cupcakes are on par. Overall I will give it an A-OK until I have a better experience with the cupcakes. They could also use an increase in variety and I believe that some of the items on the menu are overpriced.", 
      "I've had the cupcakes here, and I could take them or leave them. \u00a0On a tip from a friend, I got the salty caramel ice cream. Heaven. \u00a0I will never go back to ordering cupcakes here. \u00a0The atmosphere is the definition of twee, which I actually don't mind, but some people are put off by it. \u00a0I've also never been served promptly here, which seems a bit crazy since they aren't making anything that complicated. \u00a0Put the cupcake on a plate, scoop the ice cream into a bowl.5 stars for the salty caramel ice cream, 2-3 stars for everything else.", 
      "I absolutely love this store! Yeah you're going to pay a bit more, but they're a specialty store for cupcakes... what do you expect. If you want a cheap cupcake make them yourselves or buy the nasty ones from the grocery store.I am actually using Cream & Flutter for my wedding cupcakes and they have been absolutely wonderful to work with. On my first meeting with them they actually let me try some of the flavors that they had, and she even let me try to smore's cupcake she was making for an upcoming wedding. Holy cow, they were good!I've also had their ice cream and their pear moscato ice cream is amazing, definitely try it if it's an option, so light and refreshing. I've had great service and experiences from them. A great place to go for a treat!", 
      "A bit expensive, but really solid service and excellent final product. I had to order cupcakes for someone in Illinois and I ordered extremely custom design (Magic: The Gathering if you must know). Not only did they pull it off, they ROCKED it, and the dude who got the cupcakes was super duper happy. The cupcakes themselves were basically nirvana and totally awesome. So really, they are completely a 4-5 star joint--just be warned that they are more expensive than other custom cupcake orders. But, quite honestly, for this level of quality? It is worth it.", 
      "Ok so not bad cupcakes, a bit pricey for what you get, but not bad. Some nutrition info would be nice to find online.", 
      "Amanda did our wedding cake and dessert table and everything was absolutely amazing! She is always willing to meet with you or work with you to get exactly what you are looking for and more. Everything tastes wonderful! I also love visiting the shop and I can never pass up her brownies...so good.", 
      "If you are going to devote an entire store to cupcakes, shouldn't the cupcakes be good? \u00a0I've tried this place three times and each time the cakes were dry. \u00a0Once I would describe the taste as \"oily.\"", 
      "I love their angel food cake cupcakes topped with freshly whipped icing and fresh fruit. However, it could do with a better price tag. Freakin' $5 for a teeny tiny cupcake? No. I miss Cakes on Walnut's ginormous cupcakes topped with a ton of buttercream frosting and friendly staff. Now, I'm forced to stand in line with servers who either have plastic smiles or just cold stares. Service is such a big component of the food industry! It makes me sad, since the decor is beautiful and very hipster. Chic, modern and on trend, but the staff could definitely improve. They have a nice array of artisan candles, ice cream and lotions for sale as well. (Equally overpriced, unfortunately).", 
      "\"One of my favorite places in the world. I'm sorry for anyone who has had a bad experience and decided to review Cream & Flutter poorly. The quality, atmosphere, and overall aesthetic could NOT be better!\"", 
      "Came in \u00a0with my roommate because we were really craving a cupcake. I must say the cupcakes were very tasty, but a bit expensive considering we're not even in the city. Other than that, the place was great and the service was very friendly. I had the dark chocolate cupcake and the whip cream was perfect no so sweet but a perfectly light. I would definitely go back again.", 
      "Let's ignore, if we may, for a moment, that \"cream and flutter\" sounds like something that you do just before you tie your sweater around your waist and come up with a really good explanation for your grandparents as to why you have to leave the Golden Corral Buffet and run home really quick. \u00a0Just ignore that, okay?Think of girly things. \u00a0Fluffy icing and edible pearls and candy butterflies dancing on the sparkling breeze. \u00a0And fancy say-something hats with bows! \u00a0Also think of how big your ass is getting. \u00a0Then immediately push that thought away and think of Christina Hendricks and her juicy rump and decide, mehh, I never really wanted to be a size 2 anyway, so brang on them cuppitycakes! \u00a0I said BRANG EM I'M STARVINGI had to wait a few hours for an Amtrak train to bring me back from a work trip in Champaign to reality in Chicago. \u00a0I had a few hours more on my hands than I expected to have, because I thought I'd be doing some rad ass thrifting. \u00a0However, it turned out that the \"vintage\" stores in Champaign mostly deal in pilled Fubu sweaters and Express working lady pants from 1997. \u00a0(Also they're the types of places that sell shit loads of stinky incense cones and chunks of homemade soap they're no doubt hawking for some dread-headed college sophomore named Heaven Jade or something. \u00a0Why do crappy vintage stores always have that stink stand in the front? \u00a0Is there EVER some kind of emergency wherein a place doesn't smell bad enough, and a person needs to know where they can get affordable stench in a pinch? \u00a0\"I know! \u00a0The local vintage store!!\") \u00a0So, disappointed with the cast-offs of U of I students from a million years ago, I set myself up at a table in Cream & Flutter to do some work and have myself a lil treat.The cupcake lifted my spirits like nothing else. So yum and soft. \u00a0I ate it with a FORK, and I NEVER do that! \u00a0Then I licked the fork! \u00a0Also, the personal french press I guzzled in about 6 minutes didn't hurt my mood, either. \u00a0I was blazing through my inbox and taking no prisoners! \u00a0And yes, everything was in coffee and sugar all-caps, as in \"I AGREE CAN WE GET THIS PROJECT OFF THE GROUND BY OCTOBER 2 WHAT DO YOU THINK OMG WHAT IS HAPPENING NEVERMIND I'M OKAY DID I TYPE THAT I DID OKAY BYE.\" \u00a0It was a bit noisy in there as the place has wood floors and loud conversations will make you feel like you're in the gym at your grade school, only as a big person. \u00a0But points for them not booting me out for lingering, points for the sugarfest, and a kick and a stretch for the cutesy girly interior.If I'd known they had cutesy girly alcoholic beverages, I would have gotten on that train drunk as hell. \u00a0Oh well, next time. \u00a0Reach for the stars!", 
      "I love their cookies.", 
      "The name change is a little ridiculous, and I have no idea what is going on with that. \u00a0Overall, it's pretty good, but I have to admit, I really like the IDEA of C&F rather than its execution. \u00a0I miss the more frequent cupcake options, and although the gelato is good and the coffee beverages still alright, it's far less awesome than I initially felt when I moved here 3 years ago.", 
      "They offer quality cupcakes in the dead of night! Who else does that? This place is great, and their little desserts are the most unique combinations: Mexican hot chocolate, salted caramel, pistachio passion fruit. I've never seen another place like this and will definitely stop back after a late beer next door at the Blind Pig.", 
      "1. \u00a0If you sell cupcakes, have more than three kinds of cupcakes for sale, and more than nine total in the display case. \u00a0It's a cupcake store. It's not an art gallery. \u00a0Fill the display case with, oh, I don't know, cupcakes.2. \u00a0If you sell cupcakes, make sure they taste like cupcakes. \u00a0Hint: Cupcakes should taste like cakes, not like cardboard cups. Those are cakecups, and are totally different.", 
      "I went in with a friend who needed something else after our meal and awful dessert at Radio Marias (see that review as to why). \u00a0I wasn't in the mood for more dessert because the cake at Radio Marias made me sick, but it was definitely cute atmosphere. \u00a0And they put the cupcakes in nice little decorative boxes to go. \u00a0Lots of unique flavors to try out. \u00a0They had almost sold out when we got there late at night, so I would recommend during the day for lots of choices. \u00a0I will definitely be going back to try each and every flavor of cupcake they have. \u00a0The drinks were a little pricey, but I guess that's to cover the cuteness of the place. \u00a0I didn't have one yet, but most likely will in the future. \u00a0And they have an area for outdoor seating in the front to watch the people walk by.", 
      "I really want to love Cakes on Walnut. I really do. I'm a fan of cupcake places up in Chicago, but Cakes on Walnut cannot compare to any of the places there. I gave this place 3 chances, and all three times i left feeling meh. For a cupcake place, the selection was poor. My cupcake tasted good, but not good enough for a place that specializes in cupcakes.There wasn't a lot of varieties, and the price was on a slightly inflated side. Besides the cupcakes, which is supposed to be the main attraction, there's not much draw to the place there besides the ample seating. Maybe I'll give this place a 4th chance sometimes, but I feel like I should spend my money at Pekara (for pasteries) or Kopi (for drinks) instead.", 
      "Beyond disappointed in this place. \u00a0My husband and I \u00a0stopped here tonight for an extra special treat for dessert and were both underwhelmed. \u00a0$3.50+ for a dry cupcake with literally tasteless frosting. \u00a0At 5 p.m. I don't expect the cupcakes to be fresh from the oven but I don't expect them to be dry either. \u00a0Sorry to say we won't be trying any more of their products nor will we recommend them to friends.", 
      "In a word, disappointed.My fiance and I tried Cakes on Walnut three times. The first the staff was rude and told us they were closed despite the fact that they technically should have been open for like 5 more minutes.Attempt #2 we entered about an hour or so before closing when we asked for cupcakes they looked at us like we were mental and said they were out. And gave kind of a 'duh' look... Rude to say the least. Not even apologetic that they were completely out of their namesake treat.Final visit. Went in around the same time as our second attempt and.. Victory! They had cupcakes!.. We ordered two. One was the spicy chocolate cupcake with butter-cream frosting and toasted marshmellow. \u00a0It was gross. DRY. Frosting tasted like pure butter.. spicy chocolate was a decent concept, but poorly executed. The second cupcake we had was phenomenal. Best cupcake I've ever had. It was the smore cupcake, very moist chocolate cake, ooy gooooy marshmellow cream filling, marshmellow frosting and toasted marshmellows on top!! PHENOMENAL!! .. Soo.. Based on this visit alone I would give them 3 stars just because the last cupcake was so freaking amazing..but considering their rude staff, poor service, and the hit or miss treats.. AND the fact that it took us THREE VISITS and two cupcakes to get ONLY ONE GREAT ONE!! ..2 stars is the nicest review i can give...", 
      "Shape up your business model, ladies!! \u00a0I really wanted you to succeed!1. The cakes don't taste phenomenal -- good, but not great. 2. Don't bother with the coffee, get some across the street for half the price and less sass. 3. The booze? The same beer is down the street for several dollars less. \u00a0*******************BUT1. The cookies and brownies, though expensive, are wonderful, and are great for portion control (instead of making them at home and eating half the batch).2. That ice cream, though small in portion, is the BEST ice cream I have ever tasted. The most delicately flavored, nuanced, and wonderful ice cream ever. And I'm an ice cream connoisseur.3. Hey, it's \u00a0a local business with no competition. \u00a0The prices are bound to be a bit high."

      "I am new to the area and am starting to test out restaurants. \u00a0This one did not disappoint. \u00a0I deducted one star because the delivery time was going to take an eternity, so I had to go pick it up. \u00a0I know that doesn't sound like a huge hardship, but I was already in my PJs and parking is a little tricky there. \u00a0That said, the food was great. \u00a0I ordered the following:Samosas: \u00a0they were crispy and soft in the perfect way. \u00a0The potato filling was super tasty and they are not shy with spices. The green dipping sauce (sorry, no idea what it's called) was spicy and delicious. \u00a0I could eat these all day. \u00a0Probably shouldn't.Veggie curry: Fantastic! \u00a0Great mix of veggies, not too much cream. Even better reheated the next day. \u00a0Finishing it as I type.I look forward to eating there, it looks like a cute, laid-back space.", 
      "This was my first experience with Indian food and I wasn't too impressed. Sitara has the best reviews on Yelp and I even ordered a lot of food to try and get a variety of different things.I had the mixed grill which is Malai, Tikka, Garlic and Tandoori Chicken, and also comes with a lamb seekh kabob. I also got the Paneer Pakoras and the yellow Dol and rice which came with the meal.Almost all of the chicken were in boneless chunks, with the exception of 2 wings, which I believe were the Tandoori. They were all pretty dry and almost similar to each other. Maybe this is because they are grilled rather than fried? Maybe I'm just used to heavily breaded chicken? I'm not sure. I did like the flavor of the Tikka(?) though, it was a little sweet and spicy. The lamb kabab was a little more flavorful and better in consistency but still wasn't as good as I'd hoped. Now, the rice that came with my entr\u00e9e was surprisingly good for being just basmati rice. I was also given what felt like at least a pound of it, so no shortage there. The yellow Dol is not something I ever had before, but that I did like. It had a really interesting herbal flavor to it and can most closely be described as a soup.I also got an appetizer of Paneer Pakoras which I'd say are similar to a mozzarella stick but not as greasy and heavy. These were good but by the time I had gotten around to eating them were inevitably cold. They were unusually tasty and came with 2 dipping sauces. One was a VERY spicy green sauce and I'm not sure about the other one, possibly a sweet berry sauce. Either way these sauces were delicious and I ended up dipping my chicken in them.Overall the portion to price ratio was pretty good, although I wasn't very happy about how expensive my meal was considering I didn't much care for the chicken which was most of my dinner.Delivery speed was really quick probably about 30 minutes but I actually think the delivery was the reason I didn't enjoy my food. Often times with delivery things sit around and get overcooked in the process. I think if I am ever to try Sitara, or any Indian food again, I will definitely go into the actual restaurant. From the pictures I've looked at, most Indian food looks very moist and saucy which is what I was hoping mine would be, but it was kind of dry.", 
      "Came in for lunch and had the chicken vindaloo. The curry was good, had good flavor and the right amount of spiciness. I have tried all but 1 other of the Indian restaurants in the CU area and this is at the top of the list so far.1 star deducted for 2 reasons:1. Service was subpar. The glass of water I got was lukewarm. Had maybe 1 sip of water left in the glass and the server looked at my table, walked by a few times without refilling, went back behind the bar and was on his phone. About the 4th time he finally came back and finally refilled the water....with more lukewarm water.2. The vindaloo had broccoli in it. I've had vindaloo plenty of times and have had different places add a variety of veggies, but never crunchy broccoli. It was kind of random and kind of seemed like it was a random vegetable added to the dish to stay true to the menu that said \"a curry with assorted veggies\". Honestly it took away from the dish. I would most probably come back here and try another dish and hope that service is a little better.", 
      "It's a shame that I had to give this place only a 3 star rating, even though the food was quite good and I have recently started to really like Indian food. The problem was the service. I'm normally not picky about service, as long as I get what I ordered I'm happy. But decide for yourself whether the following is acceptable to you. They're supposed to open at 4:30, and we arrived at 4:35 to find the door closed and locked. My wife and I then walked around the block for a few minutes to wait, came back, and the place still wasn't open. I peered through the window to check if anyone was inside, and made eye contact with two of the restaurant staff. They stared at me, then went back to chatting with each other (they weren't even busy preparing tables or anything). By this time it was around 4:45.Once inside, we basically got the cold shoulder treatment, as if they were being passive-aggressive about my peering inside earlier. No smiles, no welcoming attitude, and when they came to take our order they just stood next to us without saying or asking anything. We ordered a lot so we had plenty left over, and specifically asked for TWO boxes to go, and they only brought one of the small boxes, which was clearly inadequate for how much we had left. So in summary, 4/5 for the food, 1/5 for the service, 3/5 overall.", 
      "Clean and nice atmosphere. Waiters were attentive and gave refills when needed. Lunch was garlic nan, chicken tikka masala, and side of rice. Food was pretty good in comparison to the authentic foods I had in India.", 
      "My wife and I ate here for the first time this Father's Day (2014). The restaurant is small and can easily be missed if you drive by in the car. There is no street parking, but there is ample parking in the structure immediately behind Sitara (and parking in the structure currently is free on weekends and on weekday evenings). Inside it is clearly a former bar. Lots of wood, a beautiful bar; a few booths and small tables line the South side of Sitara. Service was excellent. We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and seated immediately. The lunch menu is extensive, with sections for appetizers, vegetable dishes, lamb dishes, fish dishes, chicken dishes, bread dishes, and rice dishes (each with as few as 10 or as many as 20 listings). When we visited the prices began at 7.99, with most at 9.99. Meals include either naan or rice and an entree. We tried a lamb and a fish dish, and we both liked both of them. We also had an appetizer of vegetables prepared tempura-like with delicious sauces.Our water and drink glasses were never less than half full and both our waiter and other employees checked on us several times during the meal, making sure the food was good, hot, spiced properly, etc. There were several tables with children, but there doesn't appear to be a children's menu. (They may have one, but we didn't see it.) The tables are small and close together, so it may be difficult for a person in a wheelchair or walker. The naan was freshly made when we ordered it, and it was delicious. Just a slight puff, but still dense; you could taste the char-grill on it, just right, as should be the case. The lamb was tender and plentiful in the sauce. The fish was excellent too, though to my taste the sauce overwhelmed the fish flavor a little too much. Tasty, but I prefered the lamb because the balance of meat and sauce flavors let the best of both come through.There were several flat screen televisions playing Indian music videos. They were not unpleasant-- not too loud and one could easily talk and be heard. All in all I like Sitara a lot and recommend it highly. Everything is freshly made and delicious. We will definitely return to try other menu items!", 
      "One of my favorite places to eat. Very reasonably priced and the food is delicious. I suggest the chicken tika masala, lamb vindaloo and the garlic naan. I highly recommend it! Service is also polite. They make sure that you always have enough to drink and are speedy.", 
      "We live in Chicago and have some pretty amazing Indian food up there. But since we come to Champaign/Urbana often I was so pumped to hear about this place opening.We came in and we were literally the only other people in there which was kind of a bummer. There was also no real signage out front and no real decoration inside. I've been to that space when it was the pizza place, and then when it was Red Star before that and not much has changed besides the fact that there were Bollywood movies playing.The service was fine, maybe a touch slow given that there was no one else there, but everyone was pleasant. The food was good too, perfectly spicy (and like spicy). I would surely come back. The only thing that worries me is the fact that they've failed health inspections. So what would've been a four star spot is now at two.", 
      "I'm here on a weekly basis, often multiple times a week to get my fix. I've finally had a less than ideal experience and I'm so happy that the owner handled it perfectly. I would hate to lose my delicious Indian food because of one unpleasant experience! As soon as the owner heard of my displeasure, he handled it immediately and appropriately. I still love, love, love this place!", 
      "This place is the best Indian food in the CU area. The Chicken Korma and the Naan are to die for. I can't get enough of Sitara!", 
      "I was overjoyed that an Indian restaurant opening up in downtown Urbana! And I was right to be excited - this place is wonderful. The service is quick and the food was great. I was dining in for once, and ordered the Vegetarian Thali dish, and I cannot recommend it enough - it's a crazy amount of food for $7.I've heard that Sitara might be owned by or otherwise connected to Bombay Grill, and I will say the food tastes very similar. Fortunately for me I also love Bombay Grill. :)", 
      "My favorite Indian place in town! The staff is so friendly and always knows exactly how we want our food done (even if we aren't sure how we want it done, haha!). It gets packed at dinner time, but take out is a good option too! Never been disappointed with a meal from here!", 
      "Went back again for take out. Portions were great and the flavor was above average. Ordered the lamb vindaloo, and got a heaping container of vindaloo and another good sized container for rice. And the garlic naan was very very good. When I stopped by to pick it up I asked one of the staff members why Somosa wasn't on the menu, he said \"it's on the dinner menu, you can ask for it any time\"Very helpful and friendly staff. Food is still good and at a fair price.", 
      "Sitara opened on Tuesday, September 3, 2013. The owner used to be the counterman at Bombay at 4th & Green in campus.Unlike Bombay, Sitara serves on china plates with metal flatware, waiter service and nicer digs all around.I had the spicy fish chili \u00a0for $7.99 at lunch. \u00a0The Fish Chili has large chucks of whitefish and green peppers in a hot brown sauce. Excellent, with a nice kick to it. This place will be a regular lunch stop for Downtown Urbana folks. \u00a0Prices are reasonable, about the same as the Bombay at 4th & Green, but not eating off of styrofoam with plastic forks. \u00a0Lunch entrees were $5.99, $6.99 and $7.99.Sitara is in the space formerly occupied by the Embassy, The Red Star Liquors, and Black Rock Pizza; all across the street from Busey Bank's parking lot on Race Street between Elm and Main.", 
      "I absolutely love this place and get the same thing every time: The shrimp vendaloo spicy x2. The naan is incredible and for lunch it's around $8.00. My only complaint is that the bar is underutilized. They need to do something with the decor to make that more appealing.", 
      "Chicken Vindaloo and Tandori Chicken... (yeah, I like chicken!) was had today for lunch. \u00a0It was way good. \u00a0The naan was massive. \u00a0The staff was on top of things. \u00a0one star off for making me ask for Raita for my Tandori chicken.. come on! \u00a0Overall it was great.i'll be back.ps. thanks for not being an Indian Buffet spot, there is a time and a place for that, but not in downtown Urbana. \u00a0Make us order dishes, and not have to waddle out big american style.", 
      "Went here for the first time with coworkers at lunch on 9/25. It was an excellent experience. The three of us each had samosa as appetizers (they're not on the lunch menu, but just ask for them) and we shared three entr\u00e9es, along with plain and garlic naan.The samosa were excellent, with good flavor and a healthy kick - probably the tastiest samosas I've had in a while. The coriander chutney was deliciously fresh, and one coworker who accompanied me said it was reminiscent of the way she liked it back home in India.The naan (garlic and plain) was delicious, and our main courses - two chicken dishes and channa masala also met with our satisfaction. The two different chicken dishes had distinct flavors with a good level of spice and flavor. The channa masala was also delicious; we asked them to crank up the heat on this one, and they obliged.We were all pleased with our meal, and the price was fair for the quantity and quality of food. The entr\u00e9es are served in brass bowls with china plates.It's hard to believe that a mere dozen years ago, we had NO Indian cuisine in Champaign-Urbana; we now have several excellent choices including Sitara, both on-campus and off.We will definitely be back. This fine Indian restaurant is a great addition to the dining options in downtown Urbana.", 
      "I visited Sitara just after they had opened. There was a surprise inspection there at the same time. They had to shut off their oven ( which makes me wonder what was wrong in the first place) due to which we could not get any type of breads that we had previously ordered. This was told to us after waiting 30-40 mins for the food. They just got the curry along with rice and told us this is all they can make right now. No apologies, nothing. I heard good reviews about the food and went back to give it another shot. But the food failed to impress me. I tried a couple of different chicken dishes. The food was just average. Nothing great. \u00a0I even tried a bread other than the Naan. It was nothing like what it is supposed to be ( I am from India and I know what I'm ordering)", 
      "After hearing from a friend that the Chef and manager who had previously worked at Bombay was working at this new restaurant, we had to go. My girlfriend and I had been going to Bombay almost every week for two years but noticed a gradual decline in the quality of the food. The food we were looking for was at Sitara.The food was just as great as it was before. I always get the chicken korma 2x spicy while my girlfriend gets the (Sitara) chicken aloo also 2x spicy. The naan amazing and a must-have.The only reason I am giving this a 4 is because the service is very dependent upon your server. Sometimes everything will be perfect, other times you'll be ignored from the time you get your food to when you get the check handed to you without a thing being said.", 
      "Sitara was a pleasant surprise in the Indian food scheme of the C-U area, with good flavors and a casual but comfortable ambience. \u00a0The tandoori chicken was pleasantly tender and moist (a hit-or-miss in C-U). \u00a0Prices in general are OK, at $9-12 for entrees. \u00a0The only complaint is that the staff didn't cut up the naan, which made eating and sharing a bit awkward. \u00a0Stop by if you're in the area, for a casual lunch or dinner experience.",

      "Solidly good Indian fare. Went with a group and had the huge booth in the back. Good ambiance. Friendly servers. Good selection of 'ethnic' beers. Friends got the Flying Horse Royal Lager which was pretty awesome (light). All the apps and breads were tasty. My chicken korma was great. Was totally full, but still squeezed in some mango and pistachio ice cream. Certain to be my Chambana Indian restaurant for both in-house and take-out.", 
      "Yeah yeah, food and service are pretty good, but let's talk about what really needs to happen here... Sitara needs to take better advantage of the beautiful bar and their endless stock of Bollywood films. Turn this bad boy into a Bollywood discotheque after hours. HMU when that's a thing, and I'll change my rating from a 4 star to a 5.", 
      "Should have discovered this place earlier. Best Indian restaurant in town with very reasonable prize. Awesome environment and good services. My boyfriend and I ordered sauteed shrimp as appetizer, a chicken entree, a lamb grill, plus two lasses for only a little over $30. The tandoori specialties are must-tries! I ordered seekh kabab, a lamb sausage kabab, and it tastes awesome!", 
      "Update: \u00a0I had previously written the bellow review with 4 stars. \u00a0However, I must now change it to 1 or even less. \u00a0I just called them to make an order for pickup. \u00a0I am not Indian and am not the most sophisticated when it comes to Indian food. \u00a0I tried asking a few questions about their Chicken Chili before making my order. \u00a0The guy on the other end was extremely short with me and even hung up on me. \u00a0If this is how they treat people then I will not be going back. \u00a0My post can be updated again with a good response from management. \u00a0Previous Post: \u00a0We ate at Sitara the other night. \u00a0I had one of the paneer dishes and thought it was outstanding. \u00a0I also ordered two orders of naan. \u00a0The naan was huge, the size of a blanket (slight exaggeration). \u00a0Our waiter, Johnny Bravo, did a wonderful job. \u00a0I didn't give this five stars because I decided to be more picky in my reviews. \u00a0I would definitely recommend this place.", 
      "Food was spicy even it said to be mild. But the curry tasted very good. Nan was soft and warm!", 
      "The restaurant was very clean and the service was good. The food was very rich, delicious and well spiced. I also found that their menu descriptions and spiciness ratings were accurate for the dishes we tried. Overall, a great value for the money. I have eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants in the bay area and Sitara is on par with big city cuisine. I recommend trying them!", 
      "BEWARE of this place. They do not use a calculator for some reason to add up your bill and end up charging you more. Most people wont notice it but clearly they do it more than often. I am pretty sure its not a mistake because it has happened more than twice.Also, while ordering they DO NOT specify if rice is extra or if they are trying to cross sell a product, they make it sound as if it comes with the entree. I would be careful of their practices. Finally, the quality of food is no different than bombay grill... its same old bombay grill type of food.", 
      "Food was great. Naan is huge and delicious. Would have been a 5 star rating if they had had more tables as my fianc\u00e9 and I had I sit at the bar to eat dinner, which is pretty difficult when eating Indian food. Will eh back again, and will most likely be our go to to-go takeout spot.", 
      "Its alright. Good place to sit down, good decor etc. Samosas could have been better. I feel the food is kind of the same as all the other indian places in C-U.", 
      "I love this Indian restaurant! I've been to many across Central Illinois and have even been to India. Their chicken mahkani is great and can be ordered at several levels of spicyness. Naan is great, too. The service has always been excellent. They even made lamb jalfrenzi for me even though it wasn't on the menu. In addition, their prices are some (if not the most) affordable in town!", 
      "Been going there \u00a0two a week now. We had Curry fish, Aloo Gobi, Lamb Saag today. Curry was very rich and savory without strong scents of coconut. Aloo was unbelievable with bright reddish tomato paste. Lamb Saag, the saag still surprises me every time and it's a full bowl of lamby lamb chops today.", 
      "I am definitely a fan of the food at Sitara. The quality of the food is good, and the flavors are spot on. I've done both eating in and take out, and I would suggest doing take out if you're short on time because the service can be a bit slow. I personally feel like the entrees could be just a little bit bigger, and I wish they would add onion chutney to their chutney offerings.", 
      "When it comes to Indian this is the place. I have had almost everything under the chicken menu. Never disappoints. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Prices are great and they have great deals on gift certificates too for the holiday season.", 
      "Quite easily the best (Northern) Indian restaurant in Champaign-Urbana, and one of the best I've been to anywhere. The food is fresh, and the range of flavors broad and well balanced. Spice level is very moderate and can be increased on request for those desiring a more invigorating experience. The napkins are cloth and quite absorbent, very capable of handling a level 3 Vendaloo's worth of forehead sweat.I'd list the dishes I prefer but they have all been excellent and I have no one favorite, though I do get the fish curry and chicken do pyaza more frequently than others. I love rice but choose paratha nine times out of ten, only occasionally getting rice or garlic naan. The samosas are perfect and don't forget the tamarind sauce, which is a great highlight to the main dish also.I'm not sure how anyone could give this place one star, especially having not even tried the food. The owner Bobby is a straight shooter, by all means check your ticket but I find it difficult to believe he or his staff are cheating the totals.", 
      "Great Indian food! Really delicious, generous portions. They have a Thali special is an amazing array of Indian favorites that is offered vegetarian or no vegetarian for $7.99 and $8.99 respectively. The also have a pretty well executed menu to choose from with a lot of traditional north Indian dishes. I love Indian food for all its complexity and flavor and this place did not leave me disappointed. Definitely try it out for a quick and delightful lunch.", 
      "The food here is great! Full of flavor and very fresh. The restaurant is also very nice and clean and the staff are extremely professional. I'd go here instead of Bombay, the food is better and the prices are a lot cheaper!!!", 
      "Tried this place for lunch on a Saturday. The staff was nice and the vegetarian options were yummy and inexpensive ($14 for two lunch entrees and naan). It's a great addition to downtown Urbana and it's nice to have an option for Indian food outside of Bombay.", 
      "Sitara is an amazing restaurant. \u00a0The service is great and the food is amazing. \u00a0My 5 year old little girl absolutely loves to eat at Sitara. \u00a0My other 2 children love the food just as much as their 5 year old sister. \u00a0When we go there and sit down and eat my children love to watch the Indian videos that they have playing on the TV's. \u00a0The service is always quick and they are very attentive to what is going on around with each customer (even when they are super busy) . \u00a0The food is always amazing. \u00a0The cheese naan is very tasty. \u00a0We all would say Sitara is the best Indian food in Champaign-Urbana. \u00a0Sitara is the only Indian restaurant we will ever eat at again! Thank you for such great service and the amazing food. \u00a0All 3 of my children get to pick where they go for their birthday dinner and it has been Sitara for all 3 of them!!!!"

      "The perfect inexpensive diner experience - even though it's a small place, we have been there several times and have never had to wait to sit (including a weekend morning). Don't get me wrong, there's always people there, just always seems to be a table ready!We are not big eaters so we get a half order of French toast, breakfast special, and a side of grits - and split that all between us and our 1 year old daughter. French toast is unique and excellent, and the breakfast special is exactly what it is supposed to be - eggs, sausage (or bacon), toast, American potatoes, and coffee, and prepared how you like it.Everything including a milk for the daughter is $20 with tip.Service is awesome - everyone is super-friendly.1/2 star reserved for the inconvenience of not accepting credit/debit cards - that would make this place 5 stars! For now, make sure you keep an Andrew Jackson on ya!", 
      "The biggest flaw of this place is the extremely slow wait times. There seems to be only one cook. I set my parking meter to an hour and twenty minutes and it was expired by the time I returned to my car. That meant that we waited around fifty minutes for our food. The staff is relatively amiable. However, I did catch them complaining about a customer who wanted her order done sooner. They talk about that customer as if she was in the wrong. Another problem are the extremely small tables. Its greatest strength are its really good prices. The breakfast special is $4.75 I believe for two eggs, two pancakes, and two sausages or bacon. It costs $6 if you want to include the misnamed American fries and coffee. Their \"American\" fries is actually very soft hash browns.", 
      "The service was slow, despite it not being busy. When our good finally arrived, it wasn't particularly excellent. The eggs and potatoes tasted a bit like burnt spatula. It wasn't a bad meal, but it didn't warrant the 30 minute wait we experienced before getting it. Refills to our coffee were few and far between. Getting the check at the end was also a nightmare, taking a good 15 minutes.", 
      "Sam's Cafe, is a diner our host choose to take us and if you like a good breakfast diner this is your spot! \u00a0All I had was coffee cause I'm not a huge breakfast kinda guy... But the Coffee was awesome! \u00a0Way better then your normal bottomless pot type diner coffee.The rest of the gang ordered Omelettes, \u00a0and French toast and both looked superb.. \u00a0They were excited by the amount of food you can get for not much moola! Everyone was super stoked about our Sam's stop, and the staff was great and kept my coffee full!", 
      "After seeing the reviews of this place a friend and I decided to try it. We were completely disappointed and frustrated afterwards. When we first walked in I totally thought of turning around to leave, but I tried not to 'judge a book by its cover'. So we sat down and the service was just terrible. He talked way too fast and barely gave us time to respond. Didn't like him at all. As for the food, we ordered their special - eggs, sausage, American fries, and pancakes. EHHHHH! It was edible, sure, but delicious? Yeahhhh, no. I only ate it because I was really hungry and we had to pay for it anyway. The only positive thing I could say is it is cheap, so if you don't want to spend a lot on breakfast then I GUESS you should visit this place. By the way, CASH ONLY!* Another problem we had here.", 
      "They have the \u00a0best French toast. My husband always ordered Denver omelette where we were here. The price is also very reasonable :)", 
      "It's like stepping back in time where diners like this were a staple for breakfast for many. They had many tables in the back where the good old boys were catching up over their breakfasts. \u00a0It might look run down or old, but everything looked clean. The server was nice and attentive. \u00a0I had the breakfast special with 2 scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and fluffy pancakes. Nothing fancy, but you could tell the guy at the grill had the experience of cooking many a breakfast like this over the years. Very inexpensive too. You find the bathrooms by going through back door to storage area and it's to your right. Simple food but simply good too.", 
      "This place is what it is. A cheap greasy spoon dive with a cash only policy. If that sounds repulsive to you, don't go!If not, go and definitely have the French Toast.Service is ok at best but wth?", 
      "I'm such a huge fan of hole-in-the-walls. As my friend Andrew W. once said, they have nothing else going for them but their food. Therefore, the ones that stay open are successful by the sole virtue of their food. And that's exactly why I'm giving 5 stars to Mr. Sam and his cafe of dive heaven. I have many regrets from my college career. One of these is that I didn't discover Sam's until late in the game. I get to experience two of my favorite words here: CHEAP BRUNCH. Breakfast platter special for $3.75??? Fluffy french toast for under $5???? Pancakes? Omelettes!!!?? OH YES PLEASE GIMME NAO I WANT IT I WANT IT SO BAD.Footnotes:DO NOT eat here if:- you are on a diet. I don't think the cooks know what that word means. No Lite Butter or Diet Fat Free Bacon to be found here.- you are a snob. The \"decor\" consists of plastic furniture and faded ads in lieu of actual ceiling tiles. - you are a germaphobe.... but really, why would you be? Snap out of it, take a class in immunology. Germs ain't got nothin' on you. (Sorry, bio nerd leaking through.)DO eat here if:- you are a broke-ass college kid. Full meals for under $5 ... how could you resist?- you love breakfast foods. The french toast is particularly noteworthy.Advice: CASH ONLY; FOR BFAST, CLOSES AT 2 PM (I think - it's been a long time since I was there. It's either 2 or 1...)", 
      "So I am from Phoenix, AZ, but recently visited Champaign with the boyfriend for the holidays. \u00a0I have been hearing about Sam's breakfast, in particular the french toast, for months now. \u00a0I love french toast, it is my favorite breakfast food. \u00a0I wasn't expecting much, thinking that it was sure to be less fantastic than my boyfriend claimed it to be.Sam's is the epitome of a greasy spoon. \u00a0 No frills decor, you walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom and your table is likely to be wobbly. \u00a0The server took care of us but was busy with other tables so the service was polite and attentive but short and sweet. \u00a0We each ordered a breakfast special and then split an order of french toast. \u00a0The breakfast special items (eggs, meat, toast, hashbrowns) were basic but good. \u00a0The french toast? \u00a0Ridiculous. \u00a0Seriously, the best french toast I've ever had. \u00a0The cook dips the bread in thinned out pancake batter and then fries it up. \u00a0It is rich, crispy and seasoned with powdered sugar and cinnamon. \u00a0It was a tasty breakfast on a cold, rainy day. \u00a0When the Illini basketball team walked in the door, my boyfriend was in heaven. \u00a0At the end of the meal we realized that we didn't have any cash and Sam's doesn't take cards. \u00a0Because my boyfriend was a regular in his college days, Gus, the owner, was nice enough to let us leave, get some cash and come back to pay. \u00a0Our total was about as pleasing as the french toast. \u00a012 bucks and change for two coffees, two specials and french toast. \u00a0Crazy cheap. \u00a0Sam's is far away from home, but we'll visit everytime we're in Champaign.", 
      "This greasy spoon effectively fills its downtown niche: \u00a0no-frills service, no-frills food, and no-frills decor. \u00a0I wanted a Denver omelette but their version had onions, tomatoes, and ham instead of the expected onions, peppers, and ham. \u00a0Oh well, I ordered it anyway. \u00a0It was very good and PIPING hot. \u00a0I burned my mouth on the end when I started eating, and on the middle part several minutes later. \u00a0I also got a short stack of flapjacks for \"dessert\" and they were okay. \u00a0Top it all off with a cold glass of OJ and you have yourself a decent breakfast for $10.16. \u00a0I was here around 9 am on Sunday, and had no trouble getting the seat of my choice. \u00a0When I left, it was close to filling up, and I don't doubt that the college kids roll in here starting mid-morning.", 
      "I have always wanted to try Sam's. \u00a0Finally having a dentist appointment at 7 am (ICK!) meant that I was done and hungry by 7:45 this morning, so I went.Sam's is a cute greasy spoon hilariously sandwiched between two slightly snobby upscale restaurants. \u00a0I like that about the place. \u00a0The service is fast, the food is super-quick and quite cheap (I got a breakfast special: bacon, 2 eggs and toast--for $3.50. \u00a0I know.)I definitely got the feeling that this was a local place for a lot of the people and I was a 'new face,' but I didn't mind. \u00a0The food was fast and good. \u00a0I wish I'd tried a pancake, but I didn't this time. \u00a0I'd go back again.Basically, it's no-frills, straight up fast and cheap service. \u00a0And that's refreshing. :)Oh, and they don't take cards. \u00a0Bring cash. \u00a0It's not like you'll need a lot of it!", 
      "Disclaimer: \u00a0This is a review of Sam's Cafe's new evening menu.In recent months, Sam's, which appears to be a typical greasy-spoon coffee-and-eggs place during the day, has begun serving delicious Lebanese food on Thursday and Friday evenings. \u00a0My husband and I came with two other friends, with whom we seldom agree on where to eat. \u00a0I was curious about this place, but wasn't holding out extremely high hopes, since one of my dining companions is from the Middle East and has sky-high standards for Middle Eastern cuisine. \u00a0All these problems melted away, however, when we tried Sam's. \u00a0Even my Middle Eastern friend was impressed. \u00a0Service is quite friendly and lightning fast, and although the menu is limited, everything is delicious! \u00a0All the entrees are very reasonably priced and include such classics as falafel, kafte, hummus, and tabbouleh (which was especially delicious!). \u00a0All the dinners come with a choice of two side dishes (hummus, Greek salad, or tabbouleh). \u00a0The baklava is the best I've ever had. \u00a0One caveat: \u00a0They do not accept credit cards, so make sure you have cash on hand. \u00a0Not knowing this caused my husband to make an emergency ATM run, but the baklava was waiting for him when he returned, so all was well.I'm thrilled that we found this place; it is a treasure! \u00a0My friends and I will now never have to argue about where to go out to eat, and that is amazing in and of itself.", 
      "Sam's Cafe has a Lebanese dinner menu now, like Amanda W. said, which includes the staples, such as hummos with a delicious puddle of olive oil, \u00a0crispy falafel, Greek salad chock full of feta, overstuffed dolmades, tabbouleh & baklava (not homemade, w/ pistachios). \u00a0Two highly recommended plates you can order are the Shish Taouk (chicken kebab) or Breaded Tilapia (one of their specials). The woman who started the menu recently emigrated to the US after the tragedy in Lebanon. Go support local business!", 
      "Did you know the specials are here at the top? Because the greasily myopic server will remind you of this no matter how frequently you visit. \u00a0You could get the best damned French toast in the world at Sam's every weekend, and I'm pretty sure he'd still point out the special.Did you read what I wrote there? \u00a0Best. Damned. French. Toast. In. The. World.How is it so good? \u00a0That's a good question. \u00a0Somehow the combination of totally ordinary white bread and totally ordinary pancake batter transcends the potential of both parts to result in something truly drool-worthy: a giant slab of golden brown toast in a pool of butter and syrup. \u00a0If you like French toast, there's no reason to consider anything else on the menu.BUT if you do, you'll find that they also have grits - a rarity above the Mason-Dixon line - swimming in butter, crispy bacon, truly over-medium eggs, and delicious pancakes. \u00a0The coffee is, well, blackish, but it's really not fair to judge a diner on the quality of their coffee. \u00a0Your mug will always be full, for better or for worse.My husband and I moved away from Champaign in 2007 but make a point of having breakfast at Sam's whenever we're back. \u00a0There are better-for-us breakfasts in Champaign. \u00a0There are fancier breakfasts in Champaign. \u00a0But there's only one Sam's, and we'll keep coming back as long as it sticks around.", 
      "This is, by far, the BEST place to eat breakfast anywhere in the world.Do not leave Sam's without trying the pancakes. Even if you don't care for pancakes, you will explode in flavorful bliss when you try them. Sounds a little creepy, but it's true.", 
      "As good as a cheap and greasy breakfast gets. \u00a0Very friendly staff, and it really feels like a neighborhood restaurant. \u00a0The breakfast special with coffee is a fantastic deal, and the refills keep coming. \u00a0Better food than Merry Ann's in some ways, since it is the same type of food, but Sam's is only open during the day. \u00a0I'll hopefully get a chance to go back for dinner.Overall, this is one of the best of breed for greasy delicious breakfast food at low low prices.", 
      "Sam's has the best pancakes I've had in quite a while. The coffee was really good too and my bacon and eggs were delicious. Sam is a charming man with a big smile, and the other staff is great too. This is so different from the bland franchise food that dominates modern American life - authentic diner food and really cheap :))For a while, Sam's served Lebanese food on Thursday/Friday nights, but not at the moment. Wish it would make a comeback, because I've heard the food was fantastic!", 
      "French toast is amazing! We were told it's better and thicker when Sam is working but it was still extra yummy. Imagine if a pancake mated with french toast and danced in cinnamon... yeah that good. Bacon was fresh and the right balance of crispy without being overdone. Scrambled eggs were made of real eggs and the hashbrowns (American fries) had a buttery taste we loved. Unpretentious, hole in the wall that is worth the drive. Cash only and bring change for the parking meters.", 
      "The best french toast you will ever eat!!!I don't even like french toast, and I went to this place and ordered it based on reviews and I am so glad I did. \u00a0I'm a believer. It has this crispy outer area and is drenched in cinnamon sugar, and perfect with syrup or without. \u00a0A half order is plenty one, but go all out and get the full order! \u00a0You'll be glad you did.Prices are great, I think a burger is under $3.00! \u00a0I have never ordered anything other than french toast and hash browns. \u00a0The hash browns are darn good too. The place is a little dumpy- poster boards on the ceiling, really uncomfortable chairs, broken equipment sitting out in the open, tables go uncleaned for awhile. \u00a0But none of this matters, it's clean enough and the food is soooo good!Side-note: they only take cash. \u00a0So go to the ATM right now, get some cash (you won't need more than $15 for two) and head over to Sam's cafe and order the french toast!", 
      "Wow. Greasy. Must be a southern thing. No clue how this has 4 stars. French toast was hidden like a pancake.", 
      "I got Sam's French Toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill. I think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it would've been better. Friendly service though.", 
      "I had breakfast here.It's a greasy spoon, as we call 'em back home. The food is inexpensive, filling, and without frills. My cup of coffee was always full UNTIL the help gave us our bill. Not cool, lady.The restroom is located in the kitchen, through that white door in the back, and to your right some fifteen feet or so later. I actually really like this idea, since it means that they're not up to any funny business in the back.", 
      "Good, cheap breakfast. \u00a0After seeing all the excellent reviews here--many of which mention the fantastic french toast--how could I order anything BUT french toast? \u00a0It was definitely pretty amazing. \u00a0Delicious, and a perfect serving. \u00a0I got a half order of American Fries on the side and it was plenty. \u00a0The only reason you'd need a full order is if you intend to split it with someone! \u00a0Basically hash browns, they were delicious. \u00a0Crispy bits mixed with soft buttery masses of potato that leave a little bit of grease on the plate. \u00a0Sounds disgusting? \u00a0Trust me, it's awesome.Considering the simplicity of our order, it seemed like it took a while to get our food. \u00a0The wait wasn't ridiculous by any means, just a little longer than I expected. \u00a0Still, we were in and out within an hour.The atmosphere is probably going to take a few visits to grow on me. \u00a0It felt cramped. \u00a0Once we settled into our little nook I felt more comfortable. \u00a0Clearly, if you're coming here, you're coming for the food...not the ambiance.And the food is indeed good. \u00a0GREAT, even. \u00a0I'll be back...for more decadent french toast...and scrumptious hash browns...", 
      "Best value in town. The breakfast and lunches are just \"ok\", greasy spoon standard, but their low, low prices bring them into the 3-4 stars territory. I would not say the place is dirty (because it's not), but I hope they wash their hands after touching that cash register.The Lebanese dinners are really special, as when we went, Sam's wife was there and talked to us about the food and culture of Lebanon, really making us feel welcome. She explained every item on the menu for the noobs and really seemed to care about us and our experience. The food was great.I cant justify 5 stars for this, as it is not high cuisine, and the decor, even for a greasy spoon, is pretty poor. But when your meal is less than $5 (with a drink, and fries), who's complaining?", 
      "I stopped in here for breakfast the other day, and it was pretty excellent. \u00a0I had the breakfast special for about $4.25, and it included two eggs, a few slices of bacon, and a short stack of outstanding pancakes. \u00a0The server was very friendly, and the food was brought out quickly. \u00a0I'd highly recommend this place for a low-key diner-style breakfast.", 
      "As far as I know, this is the only place to get good Levantine food in town! I am reviewing the Cafe's Thursday-night transformation into a Lebanese restaurant, as it never seems to be open when I have thought about trying their regular stuff. But who cares about that? The food is phenomenal! I get the garlic chicken almost every time because it's so good, but seriously everything is wonderful. It's so cute because they serve it on the same crappy styrofoam plates that you'd expect a crumby diner to serve you a greasy burger on, but the Lebanese cuisine is of a quality that could (and IMHO should!) be served at a way fancier place for way more money.What a cool place. Seriously. It's one of C-U's little gems.", 
      "Looks can be deceiving, and Sams Cafe is a classic example of that. \u00a0No doubt, there are places that look cuter with nicer decor but they don't have Sams food. \u00a0Sams is my favorite place for breakfast in Chambana. \u00a0A big reason for that is the French Toast. \u00a0It is simply the best I have every had. \u00a0The rest of the food is good, but I can rarely get myself to order anything but that. Wait staff is friendly and efficient. \u00a0This is a great place for friends to grab a some food before heading up to a tailgate or after a great night out in Champaign. \u00a0Sams is definitely a diamond in the rough.", 
      "Sam's Cafe has great breakfast food and very friendly staff at a good price. \u00a0What more can you ask for? \u00a0I had the corned beef hash with two eggs and toast - just the right amount of food. \u00a0I've heard the French Toast and pancakes are also great.", 
      "This is my favorite place for breakfast in Champaign. It is a comfort-food-greasy-spoon restaurant. I recommend doing the breakfast before your shower in the morning and then go home for the shower afterward or you will smell like the restaurant all day! The food is very inexpensive and it has the best french toast in town. The seats are quite uncomfortable but fit in with the ambiance. For a while they served Lebonese food on some evenings but stopped doing that. I wish they would bring it back. It was excellent, high quality and reasonably priced.", 
      "Super cheap, tasty and quick. Sam's is awesome for breakfast. The place is small and a bit dingy, it epitomizes what I think of as a greasy spoon cafeteria but the food is great. You can't beat the $3.70 breakfast special (two eggs, pancakes and sausage or bacon). The waitstaff is friendly and fast and the owner is slinging the food on the griddle most days.", 
      "While I can't vouch for the breakfast or lunch, Sam's Cafe has a great Lebanese dinner menu on Thursday and Friday nights. \u00a0They have a good, plentiful vegetarian combination plate which I have gotten the last two times I've been there. \u00a0On our most recent visit, I noticed that the woman who is running the menu has specials available, but only seems to offer them to people who either ask or are repeat customers. \u00a0The meat dishes, according to my fiancee, are also quite good. \u00a0I'm hoping that she will keep these two nights open for a long time to come.", 
      "Good Lebanese food on Thursday and Friday nights. I went with a couple of friends for a B.day party, and decided to share all their entree's to get a feel of all the food. The cafe itself is nothing to brag about, just a small, non-elegant, bread-and-butter diner type of place. The food was good though. They had four items on their dinner menu, each being either $7 or $7.50, including tax:1. Shish Taok. Small chicken breast pieces, fried in a garlic sauce. recommended. 2. Kibbe. I don't recommend it. A mixture of some sort and then fried, tasted strange.3. Kafta. Their main beef meal. By far the best food they had. Very tasty.4. Falafel. It was ok. nothing to brag about. They had a special meal that night, for $12, which had fried rice and cooked chicken. It was ok.Each meal comes with a choice of two meals. We all got homous, and tabolli, both of them being delicious. In fact, I think the homous was their best food! Btw, warm pita bread keeps coming, which was a nice touch.There are three Lebanese ladies who do the whole Lebanese dinner thing (Sam's cafe doesn't cater dinners on any other night other than the mentioned two). They were friendly and nice people.", 
      "They have a really good breakfast special. It is cheap and good.", 
      "This is the breakfast place of my dreams! \u00a0Two people, breakfast, less than $10.00!I know, it's not fancy. \u00a0They don't have smoothies or espresso like La Peep, they don't have stuffed pancakes like Ihop, and they don't pretend they're something they're not, like others.However, the food was really good, the coffee drinkable and the service friendly.Now if it would only move toward Urbana...", 
      "I just got back from here and first off, we waited for over an hour for our food. The people who had come in and ordered way after us were served first, which was rude. Second, I heard them talking about being out of biscuits and gravy about 20 minutes before they actually told us they were. Granted, they did take 30% off after we said something, but the food wasn't even that impressive. I'm definitely never going back.", 
      "How have I lived in CU for 20 years and never visited Sam's Cafe? We go out to breakfast every Sunday and were getting tired of our usual spots, having whittled down the list to just a few for one reason or another. So glad I remembered seeing Yelp reviews of Sam's. The American fries are great, as is the french toast. Food was out to the table in what seemed like less than 5 minutes, freshly cooked. The kids split an order of french toast and I had the breakfast special. I think next time I'll skip the pancakes with the special and eat the 1/2 piece of french toast that the littlest one left on her plate. It's not much to look at, but is clean, great service, and good food. And all for just $17 for all 4 of us.", 
      "I was going to this restaurant based on what people said on yelp and I wasn't disappointed! Food is cheap, breakfast special is $4 and it runs all day! Service was as quick as you can get and still have been freshly made! The decor is diveish but you aren't paying for a formal French you are paying for good cheap food fast! Also the french toast is dipped in pancake batter and is really delicious!!!! I know I will be going again!", 
      "This hole-in-the-wall was a great find. \u00a0Service was fast and friendly, customers were a little gruff, but nice. \u00a0Food was great for this greasy spoon. \u00a0We had t-bone steaks and french toast for breakfast. \u00a0Small place, so I can imagine it fills up fast. \u00a0Not a long wait for anything and reasonably priced.", 
      "I went here for breakfast and I was quite happy. I had a bacon and cheese omelette and hash browns. It was inexpensive and very tasty. It is a no frills greasy spoon type of place but I kind of like that."

      "This is a great place to come for a drink and a late night meal. Last night, we had the poutine and a couple of $4 flights. With a friendly staff, this is one of our regular Urbana spots to visit.Octoberfest here is phenomenal!", 
      "While I was a student at UIUC, it never crossed my mind to go here. \u00a0Only after I graduated and moved away did I come to like beer and realize how many opportunities I had missed in Champaign/Urbana...So when I was in town visiting, I finally had a chance to go here. \u00a0I thought the beer selection was good, but I would have preferred more options on tap. \u00a0Because I'm used to the higher cost of living in Ann Arbor, the beer prices seemed reasonable, especially for flights. \u00a0That said, I expected them to be slightly lower, since it's Urbana and not Ann Arbor.The menu looked great. \u00a0I got the porter marinated steak and was really excited because everything about it sounded like exactly what I wanted. \u00a0The food was somewhat disappointing, though. \u00a0I wouldn't say it was bad, but it was a little bland and just didn't live up to my expectations. \u00a0If I come back, I'd probably just get a burger or sandwich.Service was fine. \u00a0Our waitress checked on us just enough, and food came out in a reasonable amount of time.I'd definitely stop here again if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't be too upset if I couldn't.", 
      "Their desserts are now made in house and are pretty fantastic. \u00a0The mint cheesecake isn't heavy and is refreshing.The cheesecake in general here is way better than the cheesecakes I could find in St. Louis. \u00a0Seriously.They seem to have a rotating thing of desserts but if you see the carrot cake get that too. \u00a0It's a lot more delicate than what I'm used to.", 
      "I had the hanger steak. In my 22 years of life, I've never been more dissapointed by a meal. Perhaps I shouldn't have gone to Crane Alley hungry. The portion size for the beef was laughable at $18. The suace was bland. The side of asparagus was fine. The garlic mashed potatoes were decently good. My friends got sandwiches at half the cost and I was definitely envious. My favorite part about dining out tonight was watching my friends eat their meals.", 
      "Excellent quality bar food plus the more elevated stuff is good too. Good sized beer menu. Definitely my favorite place in Champaign-Urbana for outdoor dining and drinking. My favorites: Turkey pita, sweet potato fries, whatever the \"special\" hamburger is", 
      "My two best dude pals just got married on St. Patty's Day in Urbana, and we headed here for the \"reception\" lunch. Charming interior, prompt service, and tasty eats!Holiday fate included Irish stew, corned beef & cabbage, rare bit, Irish soda bread, and a platter of all of the above. Of course, I opted for the platter to get a taste of everything.- Corned beef and cabbage was nice spotted in the Irish stew. Mmm...- Rare bit - basically cheese on toast, was horrid. Soggy bread with fake, melted cheese on it. - Irish soda bread - classic!- Irish stew - infused with lamb, potatoes, and veggies. Very nice on a cold, windy day.As for drink, I had my usual Strongbow. They don't have it on tap, just in a bottle. Eh, next best thing. Can't stand the taste of it out of those yucky cans.", 
      "I live in Urbana, and I think that this is the best place to go locally for some drinks and food. \u00a0Well, I used to think that, until I had a bad experience. \u00a0One night in the summer, I went to celebrate getting a new job. \u00a0The night was going well and the server was pleasant. \u00a0The food that we ordered was severely overpriced. \u00a0$12 burgers? Are we in Manhattan? \u00a0Because I can get burgers in Manhattan for less than 12 bucks and they taste better. \u00a0But, I'm digressing. \u00a0The main reason for the one star is because after two drinks, I forgot to sign my copy of the receipt. \u00a0I totally realize that this was my error--an unintentional one. However, the server took it upon himself to run my credit card without authorization and give himself a full tip, even though I didn't agree or sign anything. \u00a0Shameful in my book.", 
      "If you like beer then this place is for you. No really, if you like beer you should come here. Now. This place features all kinds of local beers from the IL area in addition to featuring a ton of other great microbrews from across the country. I wouldn't come here in a rush because you need some time to actually read through all of their beer selections there are that many! It is a mini binder, so come ready to read about beer, taste beer, and enjoy beer, and then maybe even play a little pool (until the pool league comes in that is, since they have a league here a few days a week!). They also have beer samplers and I have to say that Matt J. and I were very impressed with our bar tender in that she not only remembered the 10 different beers we ordered, but then recited them back in order in increasing light to dark beers as well. Amazing. That is the type of bar tender at a great beer place that you want. So hat's off to her! The food looked pretty good here too and everyone here just seemed happy in general. It is a darker bar restaurant on the inside so good for group outings or dates I would say, but if you don't like beer, you will be missing the main draw of this place!", 
      "Personally, I have greatly enjoyed all of my trips to Crane Alley. There's plenty of options for vegetarians. My favorite appetizers are the hummus which is served with warm pita bread and the sweet potato fries which are dusted with brown sugar and served with barbecue sauce. Both are to die for!The beer selection is great and I enjoy the cocktails as well. Overall, it is a great place for happy hour, dinner, or for hanging out and shooting pool.", 
      "My favorite date spot in champaign. They have a fantastic beer menu and a seasonal, chef-inspired menu. Their burgers are the best in town (in my opinion). And I am yet to have something here I didn't like. Staff is very knowledgeable, at tentative, friendly, and helpful. One of Crane Alley's best features is its diversity of atmosphere. You can sit at the bar and enjoy, shoot some pool with your friends, or you can have a more private table in the back 2 stories of the restaurant that are quite and comfortable for having a nice meal. Then during the warmer months, you can sit outside on the sidewalk or in their quaint, creatively-decorated alley that is right next to the building (hence the name Crane Alley). The ambiance out there is top notch and I would highly recommend it any time the weather is nice!", 
      "This place has been a joke everytime I've gone. I only go when friends go & everytime the worst experience ever. You get poor service on all fronts.", 
      "Crane Alley is by far the best Urbana bar. Well, okay, maybe that's not saying much, but this place does stand on its merits. It's equal parts restaurant and bar; you can get a drink or a meal whether you're at a table or the bar. There are also a couple of pool tables across from the bar, and when it's warm out you can sit at a table in the eponymous alley next to the bar. (Do this at night--it can feel downright romantic beneath the strings of little lightbulbs.)Crane Alley has an excellent beer selection. They always have a dozen or so good ones on tap, and the bartenders and servers are knowledgeable enough to give recommendations. (I think they do beer tastings and whiskey tastings, although I've never been.) The liquor selection is good, with an emphasis on whiskey, and there are a couple of menu pages dedicated to sweet cocktails. I usually ordered beer here but the few mixed drinks I had were well-made.Food-wise, they serve burgers, pasta, steaks, and appetizers. I was an especially big fan of the Portobello mushroom sandwich (a burger-type sandwich with a mushroom instead of meat, and roasted red pepper, feta, and pesto) and the potato pancakes (a decently-sized appetizer that comes with asparagus and a tasty cream sauce). My only complaint about this place is that some of the meals feel overpriced--my friend ordered the hanger steak once and it was not $16 worth of steak. Oh, and I wish they had kept the beet chips on the menu; paired with a goat cream cheese for dipping, they were awesome, but they disappeared from the menu sometime last year.Downtown Urbana actually has a handful of restaurants and bars, but for whatever reason most of them feel like exclusively townie haunts. Crane Alley and Black Dog are the two exceptions, and unless you're specifically in the mood for barbecue and are willing to wait an hour for a table at Black Dog, Crane Alley is the place to go. It's too far from campus for the undergrads, so it's usually a mix of grad students and professionals. You can eat a burger at the bar, you can grab a beer and play pool, or you can treat your date to fancy cocktails and a nice dinner in the upstairs loft. Highly recommended.", 
      "Rock solid! This place will impress even the biggest beer snob in the group, especially if Belgians are preferred. \u00a0Crane Alley is Champaign-Urbana's answer to Chicago's Hopleaf. No kidding. I enjoyed a Gulden Draak and my husband had the Local Option American Muscle.They have a fabulous, albeit limited, food menu and a weekly pool tournament. The servers are friendly & knowledgeable, and there are several dining areas away from the bar and pool tables for those who require a bit more privacy. My only complaint is the presence of babies, kids, and teens in the room...one of my biggest pet peeves. Next time I'm visiting my parents in Shampoo-Banana, I'll certainly return to Crane Alley.", 
      "I've finally found a place that I can get good beer and play pool close to campus. \u00a0I first came to Crane Alley last year, and found that I loved the beer way more than the food. \u00a0The appetizers/starters are great if you're there for a few drinks/hanging around/playing pool, but I've always felt just OK about sitting down for an actual meal. \u00a0I always spend so much time choosing a beer, but the waiter/waitress is always patient in letting me choose and occasionally sample what's on draft.", 
      "Nothing worth going back for...except for the beer which was fantastic. \u00a0Food made me think of glorified leftovers and overpriced at that. \u00a0I had the steak sandwich and was very underwhelmed. \u00a0It came on two pieces of what tasted like wonderbread and the gondolza(sp) was almost nonexistent. \u00a0Great atmosphere and our waitress was very attentive. \u00a0Don't think I'll be back for the food though.", 
      "Mehhhh this place is OKAY. Nothing worth going back to. My friend and I were in Urbana and we decide to try out crane alley (mainly because black dog was closed). He said he hear it was good. It wasn't. Before I begin, the food wasn't bad per say but it wasn't great. And for the price of the burger I got. It DEFINITELY wasn't worth it. I got the 15$ burger thinking, well it's the most expensive one, should be pretty tasty right? WRONG. I substituted the fries for the soup of the day which was jambalaya. +2.50$. Blah. The jambalaya was actually pretty decent. Not amazing but it was pretty hardy. The burger came out and it just seemed like crane alley was trying to do too much on one burger. It had blue cheese, Dijon mustard, bacon and a few other things that didn't go together great. I've also forgot the name of the burger. It was the only one over 14$I almost gave this place 2 stars but I felt kinda bad because it seems like they have a good beer selection and the staff is very polite. Would I go back? Probably not. Rather spend my money on the better places to eat in Urbana champaign. :-) \u00a0I would consider going back for a drink but nothing else.", 
      "I just really love this place. The beer selection is fantastic. The food is surprisingly good.. The service rarely disappoints, and the ambience outside in the summer is awesome. Not much reason to drive to Champaign to drink when I can walk to Crane Alley!", 
      "Crane Alley rocks! Drinks are are strong and the food is great. We had the Italian beef and Reuben and both were solid. The wait for a Friday night wasn't too bad- about a twenty minute wait for a table, but we grabbed a drink and a couple seats at the bar while we waited. Atmosphere was lively and staff was great!", 
      "I went here not long after it opened a few years back and the food was great. \u00a0On the expensive side for bar food, but great. \u00a0I would stop in every now and again, but not very frequently due to the prices.The last time I went was about 5 months ago. \u00a0I don't know what happened, but the food was TERRIBLE! \u00a0I had butternut squash ravioli in a cream sauce and it was just awful. \u00a0No flavor, completely devoid of seasoning and the \"sauce\" may have been the Elmer's paste that comes in the little tubs with the brush attached to the cap. \u00a0It was actually grey in color. \u00a0Gross. \u00a0My husband had a chicken sandwich and it was small, cold, and cost about three times what he'd have paid for the exact same sandwich (quality wise) from McDonald's.The evening set us back about 60 bucks for a salad, appetizer, two entrees and two draft beers, which is pricey for CU. \u00a0So not worth it. \u00a0We have no plans to go back.", 
      "(Chanting, in that well-worn 4 beat cadence) \"OVERRATED...OVERRATED\"The food here is extremely hit-or-miss. Eating here three times, I have been very disappointed twice with my own meal and all three times with some aspect of the dining experience. Their menu sounds good, but is perhaps beyond the skill of its staff, as they often fail to deliver. Sauces are either too thin or too thick, either tasteless or too salty, and \u00a0every time at least one item was served too cold (even when it was just 2 of us). If you are the type that likes to occasionally order an appetizer for your entree, think again: many apps are really skimpy. Also, food service can be very slow at times, as I think they stretch their servers too thin. They also have very few vegetarian options, which surprises me, based upon their clientele.Notice how all these comments are about food? That is because their alcohol service, selection, and quality are all beyond reproach. Their prices, including their alcohol prices, are pretty high for what you get. For the alcohol, I can justify this to cover the cost of carrying obscure barley wines (tremendous); to charge high prices for the food, is absolutely unacceptable. EAT at V. Picasso's, Courier Cafe, Bunny's, Tang Dynasty, The Great Impasta, Xinh Xinh, Black Dog, Silver Creek, or even Siam Terrace, then DRINK at Crane Alley.", 
      "Every time I watch the How I Met Your Mother episode Best Burger in New York, I go off in search of something to satisfy that craving. There are a lot of mediocre burgers in Chambana, but you won't find that at Crane Alley.My favorite was the burger with mushrooms, gorgonzola cheese, and caramelized onions. The patty was perfectly cooked and flavorful, and I could imagine obsessing over it like they did in the episode...TV-related gushing aside, I really like this place. We also tried the steak frites with gorgonzola butter on top, and those were wonderful, and the beer selection is great. I like trying the flights myself so I don't have to commit to a full version of any one thing.The normal fries are not great. Nothing especially wrong with them, just... not great. Also, the steak sandwich was good, but whereas the steak sandwiches I'm used to are best shared with at LEAST one other person, this is more of a one person sandwich, unless you're not that hungry.Be sure to keep up on their facebook page; they have awesome beer dinners or other cool events from time to time! I went to a great beer and chocolate pairing a few weeks ago, and keep hoping there will be another.", 
      "I have to agree with those holding the \"OVER-Rated\" opinion. \u00a0The best thing about Crane Alley is the drinkin'. \u00a0They have loads of beer selection, the bar is well stocked, and we all got a little over appreciative of their fine scotch selections.The food and service though, both left much to be desired. \u00a0They serve typical pub food with some updates/twists. \u00a0Beet chips? \u00a0Why not?Our apps were all ok, not great. \u00a0The service was slow, like stuck in tar slow. \u00a0Everything here is on the expensive side.Go for a night of trying different brews/liquors; eat somewhere tastier before heading over!", 
      "Had about 10 meals here over the years. Glad they are in Downtown Urbana. Great people work here. Good Good Good drink selection/beer/booze. I have not strayed to far from my faves, so I can not really give a fair array of menu reviews here. That said, what I have had, I adore.", 
      "BEST BLACKBEAN BURGER EVER IN MY LIFE.i miss crane alley. it was my go-to restaurant in the CU area. always: blackbean burger, no sprouts with a side of greek pasta salad. even better with a bloody mary or a spicy martini, there's a specific one that i'm talking about but i can't remember what it's called...they also have an AMAZING beer selection. every time i go there are a few new draft beers. definitely try a beer flight. oh and the sweet potato fries. so goooooddddd.i've tried a few other items on the menu, but after finding the blackbean burger there was never a reason to order anything else. SERIOUSLY THE BEST EVER. 5 million stars.", 
      "I, like a fair amount of other people, think that crane alley is pretty hit/miss. \u00a0I love their beer selection, and their bartenders are friendly. \u00a0We were their last weekend, and their hostess almost drove us to insanity; we had a group of 7, and two tables opened up, more than enough so seat us all, and instead of pushing them together, she sat 2 people at the 4 person table and then let the other sit empty. \u00a0At that point, we were told the wait would be 20-40 minutes. \u00a0After an hour, still with empty tables, we went to ask. \u00a0She said she'd seat us in 10 minutes... and finally 30 minutes later after bugging her twice more, she got us a table. \u00a0The bartenders actually compted us the pool because they felt so bad.That being said, our waitress was very friendly, though not always present, but very accommodating. \u00a0Food was ok, but we were annoyed that we waited 1.5 hours to be seated when there were empty tables the entire time... we started to wonder if she was mad at certain wait staff members and trying to spite them by not sitting people in their sections. That being said, I have had much better experiences there, and I hope that never happens to anyone else.", 
      "I am making an edit to this review.It is still a nice place where you can actually go with your friends or date and hear them. \u00a0Especially since you don't have to scream over the music and noise. \u00a0It is NOT a good place to have dinner any longer. \u00a0They changed their chef or something. \u00a0The miso mussels and linguine was horrible. \u00a0Totally alcoholic.. with no miso. \u00a0When I told the waitress she took my dish back to the kitchen and brought out something that was sooo salty. \u00a0Disgusting. \u00a0The mussels were also not fresh and made me sick later. \u00a0My friend ordered the reuben which used to be superb but was too salty as well.You can guess that I will NOT be returning to eat here ever again.It's a little more expensive than other bars in the area... so expect the drinks to cost a little more than other places.I am not a fan of the beer garden since it's basically an alley between it's building and the next.", 
      "The Craft Beer Battered Fish is a great deal for a quality fish sandwich. They do not skim out on the filet at all, and they serve it when it's still deliciously hot! They also toast the bun to give it an extra crunch. I normally eat half and save the other half for later, but I couldn't resist. My plate was completely cleaned by the time we left. I also ordered a small soup on the side, it was the blue cheese tomato soup and that was really great too! We came during lunch, so there was no wait at all. I'd imagine a long wait later on during the day.", 
      "I recently made a trip back to Crane Alley for dinner, and was dismayed by the alterations to the menu, primarily the price. \u00a0I remember buying affordable sandwiches for around $6, but all sandwiches have been bumped up to the $8 to $9 range. \u00a0($8.50 for a falafel sandwich!? \u00a0Really!? \u00a0Those falafels are little nuggets of luxury now...) Quality of the food ranges from standard to good, though there is usually nothing here that smacks of culinary sophistication (especially to justify charging $8.50 for a falafel sandwich!!). \u00a0When I'm feeling indulgent, I order the fish sandwich, which is all the greasy, crunchy-crusted fish I could want. \u00a0Appetizers here are decent. \u00a0The spinach and artichoke dip tastes like every homemade version I've sampled from friends' kitchens. \u00a0The beet chips with goat cheese are considered one of their hallmark dishes. \u00a0I agree they're good--when prepared properly. \u00a0It's a gamble. \u00a0Because of the color of the beets, I think it's difficult to distinguish when they're finished cooking; I often get beet chips that taste like black charcoal.When friends propose coming here for happy hour after work, I just kind of dread it. \u00a0Crane Alley presents itself as a bar/pub, but they are more like a formal restaurant that expects everyone to stay in their assigned seats. \u00a0As someone who's waited tables in the past, I know large groups are challenging, but the waitresses here look downright insulted when they realize they have to serve our table. \u00a0They mostly avoid our group and hope that we won't ask for anything more than one meal and one drink. \u00a0Once, we showed up at a busy hour with a group of 8 and had to wait to be seated. \u00a0No big deal. \u00a0No one was complaining, we just stood in a group and chatted amongst ourselves. \u00a0After a few minutes, the hostess approached us, obviously annoyed, and said, \"If you have a group this big in the future, you're going to have to call in advance to make a reservation.\" \u00a0...Ugh, really?Sadly, downtown Urbana does not offer many options for night life, especially if you want to have a nice drink with your meal. \u00a0Crane Alley has broad appeal and is a general crowd-pleaser, so it is a safe option for a date or outing with friends. \u00a0Just make sure you don't bring too many friends.", 
      "Servers are wonderfully friendly, there are approximately 8,974 beers available*, the drink selection is broad and the bar is huge, and several of the sandwiches and appetizers are delicious. \u00a0When your'e there, do try the potato pancakes in a light cheese/cream sauce. \u00a0OMG, it tastes like magic. \u00a0*i might be exaggerating, but only slightly.", 
      "Crane Alley receives an admittedly very biased 5 stars from me. \u00a0This is partially because they're currently carrying two Bell's beers on tap (Amber--divine, and Hopslam 2X--10% abv and so magically sweet AND hoppy that Teej, my fiance and I decided that it must pour directly out of the Easter Bunny's anus...the most magically sweet and hoppy of all the rabbit anuses, as you know).Bell's aside, Crane Alley is a place I want to be at all the time. \u00a0It's dim, but not dank. \u00a0Tasteful, and not over the top. \u00a0The waitress checked in an appropriate amount of the time, was friendly, and had mad non-spilling-the-water skills when pouring all the way to the top of the glass. \u00a0I had the falafel pita, which was only 'okay', but was later upgraded to 'good' when I added salt and pepper. \u00a0It came with quinoa tabbouleh that was the slightest bit creamy, and oh-so-plentiful. \u00a0Mmm....quinoa tabbouleh.", 
      "I've been a little stingy with my 5 stars these days, and I'm tempted to rate this 4... but the sweet potato fries... there is just nothing like them!I've been here twice now during my quarterly visits to C-U. \u00a0The food, burgers in both instances, has been consistently good. \u00a0Now I live really really close to the infamous Kuma's Corner in Chicago--their burgers are so famous they've been featured on the Food Network. \u00a0That having been said... my standards are pretty high... and Crane's, I must say, makes a darn tasty burger! Today I had the special--1/2 burger with mole, roasted chilies, pork shoulder, and chihuahua cheese--oooohhhh yes.Aside from tasty burgers, their beer selection rocks. \u00a0They literally have one full page of IPAs. \u00a0And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Their draft beers (which I believe rotate?) are quality as well. \u00a0The place is big, their outdoor (alley) seating is great in the summer, and the service is good.Though I must warn you... my first time (in the summer) was during some crayfish special... tables of rowdy bikers cheered on ladies in leather bumping and grinding in their laps. \u00a0I'm not sure what was going on, and I don't know if it is somehow related to the crayfish, just thought it was worth mentioning.", 
      "Skip this place at ALL costs. I went with a small group and the service was horrible. We were seated after a long wait and then told that we could not order food because the kitchen was too small and had too many orders already in! What kind of establishment tells customers (who are seated and hungry) that they cannot order food? What a joke! We asked for salsa and chips and were told that we could not order anything. It took everything in our power not to walk out. Once we finally were able to order, the staff and management stared at our table and could not wait to take our plates. I was not even done and told the manager to leave my plate. This place is ran poorly and needless to say, our group won't be back! There are many better places to eat in the CU area!", 
      "I like Crane Alley. \u00a0I think I would go there more if I lived in Urbana; living in deep west champaign I never really feel like it has anything to offer me that I need to drive to Urbana for. \u00a0I like their food alot (especially balsamic spinach strawberry goat cheese salad AH!) \u00a0and think the vibe is pretty nice: \u00a0clean, waitresses cleavage unexposed, no patrons likely to puke most of the time.I've had REALLY slow service there alot of times, especially up in the loft.", 
      "In my mind this is a first and foremost a bar.An awesome bar with an a lofted upper level that looks down on the pool tables. A bar that has more private, cozy seating in the back. A bar that sets up outside in the breezeway (Crane's ALLEY).Great beer selection. Decent prices. Lots of seating. It was a pretty classy addition to \"downtown\" Urbana when it first opened.And fooseball... there are some crazy fooseball sharks. Don't let their meager appearance fool you.", 
      "Crane Alley is the only bar I go to in Urbana, and has the best bottled beer menu of any bar in the area. \u00a0In addition, it will have more than 10 draft beers at any one time from various microbreweries and craft breweries. \u00a0The reasons to stop by don't stop there, since there is also a fairly extensive menu of tavern-style food, which is higher quality than what one usually comes across.My favorite appetizer is Crane Alley's signature beet chips. Every table around us got this appetizer, since it is one of the dishes that Crane Alley is most known for. The beet chips come with a bowl of a goat cheese dip (which has cream cheese mixed in). The dip is somewhat rich and heavy, and helps to bulk up what might otherwise be a rather light appetizer.The sandwiches at Crane Alley run up to around $10, and the main courses a bit higher than that. Last visit, my girlfriend got a portabella mushroom burger, which was one of the daily specials, and of course had no meat. However, it was bulky enough to offset that and not be as light and unfilling as a lot of vegetarian food ends up being. I got a beer-battered fish sandwich, which was crispy and fairly large (way too much fish for the bun), along with the sweet potato fries (another thing Crane Alley is known for). One of the complaints I usually have about fried fish sandwiches is how greasy they are, but luckily this sandwich didn't fall into that trap.The primary lure that Crane Alley has is its wide selection of beers and drinks, which can be ordered alongside a selection of appetizers or food (something some local competitors do not offer). In addition, it has weekly special dishes and daily specials, and special beer and food pairings on set dates (tickets must usually be purchased). I would highly recommend anyone in the area or at the university make the effort to stop here at least once.", 
      "Stopped by here for lunch/dinner (it was 3...what meal does that count as?); it was pretty quiet since we didn't come during regular lunch/dinner hours. \u00a0Crane Alley is a \"Restaurant & Bar\" but it definitely feels more like a bar than a restaurant--it's very dimly lit, there are pool tables and a large bar area. \u00a0I guess if you like bars/feel comfortable in bars you probably won't notice this.I got the veggie sandwich and it was amazingly good. \u00a0Please allow me to list the ingredients of this most tasty of sandwiches: cucumber, bell peppers, onion, tomato, sprouts, lettuce, basil oil, sunflower seeds and dill cream cheese, all on two big slices of wheat bread. \u00a0The greek pasta salad was also tasty, and overall it was a very satisfying, generous portioned meal for a little under $7.My boyfriend had a hamburger and it was HUGE. \u00a0The fries were good and he liked the burger (although he said it had some kind of seasoning on it, which he seemed kind of \"eh\" about).Between the two of us we spent about $15 (before tip and without any drinks). \u00a0Not bad. \u00a0The desserts also sounded really good (flourless chocolate cake...mmm...) but we passed on that this time.I'll definitely be back. \u00a0I feel like if I had any interest in beer then this would be my new favorite place, but since I'm not a fan of beer or bars in general, that's kind of a deterrent for me (completely aware I'm in the minority here). \u00a0Oh well. \u00a0I'll still come back for their yummy food.", 
      "Mushroom and Spinach Lasagna with Cream Sauce- The noodles were nice and thin, the Alfredo-style bechamel flavorful- this was a nice surprise. A bit pricy though..Chicken Parm- Had a weird pepperoncini sauce on top that subtracted from the dish. The marinara was not as good as the lasagna's alfredo. The breaded chicken breast was crispy and cooked to perfection.Buffalo Chicken Sandwich- very good- HUGE portion. I prefer to get the Buffalo sauce and ranch (can't have blue cheese while pregnant) on the side and dip- otherwise the breading gets soggy. Chicken is very well cooked. Italian Roast Beef- the beef used was too lean- it was dry and chewy. Would benefit from using ribeye (like on a good Philly cheesesteak) or a well braised chuck roast that has enough fat to keep the meat tender. The au jus was not very flavorful- tasted mostly like oil + red pepper flakes. Nice beer list- they have beer dinners, ($65 or $75), but they wont' discount the ticket if you are unable to drink alcohol (e.g. pregnant me)- otherwise my husband and I would have loved to have gone to one.", 
      "lovely when the weather is just right and I can sit in Crane alley with the lights above and a plate of chips and salsa and a nice drink", 
      "a little pricey, but their chili is the best in the city. \u00a0Lunch specials are always a welcome treat as well.Try to make it here at least once in a while.", 
      "PROS: Great drinks, friendly service, fun busy atmosphere, interesting large menu (my favs are the mediterranean style Mezze plate and the Falafel sandwich, both of which are pretty rare to find around here), great specials, reasonable prices, good healthy options.CONS: Booth area is slightly odd in terms of interior design - I wish they would revamp it and make it less claustrophobic somehow..."

      "IMO, one of the only reasons to ever go into Urbana :)This is a place I visit often when I come back to see the family. A nice bar with pool tables, and an area upstairs. There is a nice beer garden in the alley next to the bar. Plenty of goodies on tap and in bottles. Boulevard Smokestack offerings, some Flossmoor Station, Two Brothers, DFH . \u00a0A really good bottle list too. \u00a0I believe they also have a monthly beer club that meets here as well.The food is great. Lots of sandwiches and several other entrees that are top notch. They have the best fish sandwich in Champaing/Urbana. A good burger and Reuben. \u00a0About the only thing I have to complain about is the service. The waitresses can be slow and don't always get the order right. Besides that a great place to quaff some quality beers in downtown Urbana.", 
      "First off: free pool till 4:00. \u00a0All around, this place is an excellent weekend afternoon relaxation spot. \u00a0We stopped in this past Saturday around 2:00. \u00a0It wasn't empty, but it was far from busy and the pool tables were unoccupied. \u00a0If I didn't live out of town, this would be my March Madness go-to spot. Second, other good details: I got the turkey pita, which was just the right size, fresh and slightly crunchy pita bread, plenty of meat, and delicious with guacamole. \u00a0The beer selection here is impressive, covering a wide range of styles and breweries from around the country. \u00a0I consider myself fairly familiar with the microbrew landscape, and yet they still had about 12 beers that I had never even heard of, plus, Crane Alley does modestly priced flights of 4 x 5 ounce tasters ($6 + a buck for the really obscure \u00a0choices). \u00a0The servers were all nice and quick to help out whenever we needed them.", 
      "Service is incredibly accommodating.Food is pretty darn good.Pool tables, with a nice, cozy darkness that doesn't attract too many obnoxious student types? Check.Just like any other great bar until you notice that they have Dark Horse Crooked Tree IPA on tap. And they're planning a dinner event to honor Dogfish Head where they'll be tapping a keg of the holy 120-minute IPA? Impressive. Way to stock the best beers! I didn't realize those vendors even made it down to Central Illinois.Oh, and I almost forgot, they have Beet Chips with a Chevre dipping sauce. -- Definitely worth a go!", 
      "great burgers and great beers!!!Even though this place is close to the campus, its far enough a way from the regular places the kids go so that is not too loud and rambunctious even on St. Paddy's Day. \u00a0The Burger really was absolutely great, even cooked to Medium- Well, it was so juicy that the first bite left a puddle of flavor on the plate....oh yeah...which then got soaked up by their great french fries. \u00a0AND they have Rouge's Kell's Irish Lager on Tap and man is that tasty....Great service too and the prices were just right...", 
      "I love Crane Alley, \u00a0their corn beef sandwich is top notch, the staff is fantastic and the atmosphere is pretty good. \u00a0 \u00a0The Alley with the lights hanging over the buildings in the summer time is \u00a0pretty terrific - you can sit there and sooner or later as people are walking through \u00a0the conversations start, everyone seems to know each other. \u00a0They have plenty of assorted beer's \u00a0and the best desert~!", 
      "Crane Alley has a great beer, wine, and hard liquor selection. Dinner can be fun here because the bar has made some excellent lighting and decoration selections. Service is \"fine,\" and although the food is not the greatest ever, it can be enjoyable while out for fun with friends.Even though food and service are really more like three stars, I'm going to go with four because the place is fun and the selection of alcohol (the most important thing, really) is superb.", 
      "You will not find hoards of undergraduates here, it might even be hard to find more than a few grad students. \u00a0And yet it has one of the best beer selections in town, a restaurant, and 4 full-sized pool tables.Drinking beer and playing pool is probably one of my favorite ways to hang out, and this is the perfect place for it.I don't know if I should let this get out much, but wednesday is half off pool night ... I played with 3 other people last week for a couple of hours and they charged us only $1.50 each! That's ridiculous. It's also not loud at all for a bar, they have outdoor seating in the ... alley .... when it's warm, and the background music is usually a pleasant mix of classic rock.About the restaurant, don't go here during off hours (not dinner), I don't think the regular kitchen is working or something is off. \u00a0I wish they had a few cheaper, more suited to a bar kind of appetizers than they do, especially since their above average overall food quality would make fantastic late night snacks. \u00a0The guyfriends manage and are usually hungry enough to eat entire sandwiches and meals by the end of the night, so they don't complain.", 
      "As one of the original customers the day the place opened...I'm proud of where the place is today. \u00a0It's evolved nicely and still retains a lot of what made it great in the beginning.", 
      "Crane Alley is wonderful! \u00a0They have a very extensive beer list, friendly staff, yummy food, pool tables and a great beer garden in the adjacent alley. \u00a0Crane alley is a good place for after work cocktails, lunch, dinner and just hangin' out. \u00a0The Fine Young Cannibal reccomends the beet chips and black bean burger!", 
      "I love Crane Alley! They have a great selection of sandwiches at reasonable prices, and the best beer selection in town. I find the Friday/Saturday specials are always creative and amazing. You can't go wrong with the frequently offered Beef Ragout Nachos (but bring 2-3 people to help you finish!).Seating outside is quite pleasant, except then you miss interacting with the friendly bartenders inside. The service is friendly, with just the right amount of attentiveness, and they are nice to our dogs.", 
      "So, overall, the food here I've had has been really good. I will say though that if you go to Crane Alley, it's not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants (esp. not the alcohol). Another thing my friends and I noticed is that if you get appetizers, they normally give you way more dipping material (hummus, spinach and artichoke dip, etc.) than you can use up with the pita provided. You will get charged extra if you ask for more pita.They always have a nice selection of beverages, particularly beers, but there's a cocktail list as well (again, just plan on it being pricey). If fresh and local is important to you, they also sometimes have menu items made from products of sellers you might see at Market at the Square in the summer. In the end, it's a great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside in the evening with your friends in the actual alley part of Crane Alley.", 
      "One word. \"Meh.\" \u00a0My wife and I checked this place out for lunch while in town. A friend recommended the Black Dog, but it was just too crowded, so we stumbled upon this place. The atmosphere is definitely more setup for more of the late-night get drunk and rowdy crew. Not holding that against them. Great beer selection - which made us excited for the overall experience, but would be disappointed. While we were there, it appeared that about half the occupants of a local trailer park decided they wanted to bring all their kids to the bar at lunch time. These people were loud and obnoxious, and their kids treated the place like a playground. I was disappointed that staff made no attempted to settle the situation down... even a \"Hey, no running and screaming in bar.\" may have sufficed.Anyway, my wife had the steak sandwich and I had the Italian beef... both pretty much had zero taste. It wasn't bad by any means, but the food quality wasn't anywhere near what the presentation promised. \u00a0Like I said... just plain \"meh.\" We would not return the next time we're in town.", 
      "This could be the most overrated place in CU.Beer selection good, everything else pretty bad.Service was particularly bad when we went and the food was not great for the price. \u00a0We ordered desert before our appetizers because we particularly wanted one of the options. \u00a0By the time we finished our main course, the waiter informed us that they had just sold out of the dessert we had ordered long before. \u00a0We were shocked by his honesty and incompetence.", 
      "Large selection of good beers. Unfortunately everything else is bad. Insipid sugary cocktails and overpriced food. I've rarely had anything good here. The beet chips are pretty good, but the wings seem to be soaked in battery acid and the tempura is just gross (who fries moist baby carrots?). I had some good steak once, but that was quite unusual. Come for pool and drinks, leave when you get hungry.", 
      "I tried their shrimp pasta...it was bland and had a weird taste. The service was a little slow, but friendly. The portions are good but for the price, I hoped the taste would have been a little more pleasing.", 
      "You wouldn't expect to find great food at a place where it looks like Fast Eddie and Minnesota Fats could walk through the door for a game of pool at any time, but you'd be wrong. The hall just feels old and dark, but they warm it up with hot food. I had a roast beef au jus and was satisfied. They have a strong beer selection and quick staff; so I'll try it again next time I'm in town.", 
      "This place used to be my favorite place in Urbana, followed closely by the Office. \u00a0Well, now the Office is closed, and I feel like Crane Alley is shell of what it used to be. \u00a0In fact, I never go out in Urbana anymore.One star for serving food all night, and one star for never being too crowded and loud. \u00a0If I only have expectations to hang out with friends at night, I'm not disappointed. \u00a0I loved the food about 3 - 6 years ago, but recently, the food quality has declined and the service is horrible. \u00a0We met up with friends there, they had been there for about an hour. \u00a0Let's just say we got our food before their order was taken. \u00a0We were at adjacent tables outside. \u00a0At lunchtime. \u00a0Bad.Why the third star? \u00a0This is where my boyfriend and I went on our first date over three years ago. \u00a0Obviously, it was a good date.", 
      "They have a fantastic beer list and the food is very good although pricey for what you get. The service is the reason for my low score. If not for the weak service, I would give the restaurant either a 3 or 4. I went and ordered a beer that the menu stated was 12 ounces. The glass it was brought in was clearly not 12 ounces. When I brought it to the waitresses attention, she argued the point. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that the beer really was less than 12 ounces and she took $1 off the price of the bill. I prefer restaurants who take their customers more seriously than this.", 
      "I want to like this place more, because the service is good and the space itself is inviting. I like BEING here, but the food is mediocre. The burgers are mealy and taste more like seasoning than meat. Nothing I've had here is remarkable, and I've been lots of times, since it's a great place to meet up with friends and drink.", 
      "Based on my food alone, 5 stars! \u00a0I had blackened tuna pita with petit salad and it was amazing as served. \u00a0My husband had a fried fish sandwich and it wasn't great, but nothing compares to destihl's fried fish. \u00a0The service was terrible. \u00a0Our waitress was in a foul mood and had a bad attitude with every table in our section.", 
      "I had lunch with a friend at Crane Alley yesterday. I'd never been there but had heard mostly good things. I'm going to agree with that assessment: mostly good!I had the portobello sandwich, with peppers and a nice pesto topping. I was sort of disappointed when my friend said she wasn't into beet chips as an appetizer, but completely excited when I saw I could substitute my fries for beet chips! Yay! We ended up sharing the spinach and artichoke dip app. It came with toasted pita slices. Mmmmm. The food was interesting, and it was good. It wasn't fantastic, or mind-blowing, but it was solid, and the menu had a good variety of selections. The price wasn't super cheap, but it wasn't outrageous for lunch. My sandwich (plus beet chips, which do carry a surcharge as a substitution), my friend's entree (a bowl of the soup of the day and a Reuben), one soft drink and our appetizer = 28.79 before tip. The drink menu is HUGE! I'd love to come back for dinner and drinks sometime. The ambiance screams \"You're in a bar!!\" which considering that, hey! you're in a bar, that works. It was cozy, the lighting was low, the booths black - might be a nice place for a casual date. The one aspect that shone above all was the service. Our waiter was FANTASTIC. He was knowledgeable about the menu, helpful without being pushy or overbearing, very attentive, we had regular drink refills but he didn't make it hard for us to continue our conversation. He even brought us an assortment of to-go containers so we could keep the dip and pita chips separate - what a guy! That waiter deserves five stars (and a large tip)!", 
      "Great (!) Beer selection and friendly wait staff. The food is also generally very good. I especially recommend the spinach artichoke dip. Sooo yummy, but sadly a little skimpy on the pita that goes w/ it. Beers aren't cheap but I've never been anywhere w/ such a great selection. Pretty nice beer garden area on the side of the building as well.", 
      "Ate here on a whim one night when Black Dog Smoke House was packed and really enjoyed it. I've been here three times now with different people. Best piece of advice for ordering food: avoid the pastas, get the burgers, mezzo plate, or tacos (when on special). The pastas I've had or others with me have had were not that great, but the \"pub food\" is interesting and done right. Plus, you cannot beat the beer selection and their prices are fair. Service is always fast, even if they're crowded.", 
      "I grew up in Urbana, and many times with so many great places to eat in the C-U/Campustown area it can be hard to choose where to go. Something everyone can always agree to is Crane Alley! The food is AMAZING and way better quality than most bars can claim. The sweet potato fries are a must try, and I also love the turkey pita sandwich! Also a great selection of beers and full bar, not to mention a great atmosphere. I love to sit in the alley in the summer! Definitely one of my favorite spots at home!", 
      "my opinion of the food remains the same. \u00a0it's okay. \u00a0seems fresh. \u00a0still costs more than it should. \u00a0however. \u00a0wait service. \u00a0yikes. \u00a0it's never been great... but my experience last night was not awesome.i was waited on by a guy with a deep v and plenty of chest hair. \u00a0he seemed put out by everything... and not in the slightest hurry to do anything. \u00a0refill drinks. \u00a0take orders. \u00a0smile. \u00a0my party wasn't ready to order when we first arrived. \u00a0we ordered drinks and an appetizer. \u00a0we brought it and plunked it down on the table, not saying a word. \u00a0he didn't return to our table for over 20 minutes. \u00a0in other words... a long ass time.when we finally ordered, it took a long time to come out of the kitchen. \u00a0i could understand if it were busy. \u00a0but it wasn't. \u00a0there were four tables sitting outside and only one other table inside sitting beside my party of three. \u00a0a couple of guys at the bar. \u00a0i have had a lot of \"meh\" experiences at crane alley... and really... for the food, it's just not worth it. \u00a0smile deep v guy! \u00a0seriously! \u00a0if you're gonna be slow, at least be gracious. people love the affable slow poke. \u00a0too cool for school and slow never won popularity contests.", 
      "Lets start with the good parts great beer and scotch list the food was good, fresh, and hot. So much for the good stuff, the wait service, bad is an understatement, we where seated the waitress took our drink order we got our drinks and she was gone. Finally we were able to get her attention and ask if we could order. We got our food and she was gone again had to go find her or yell at her as she zipped by to get anything you needed or wanted, even drink refills its a bar at least keep my beer full. Boy do you pay for the bad service you get, crab cakes appetizer, fish sandwich, ruben sandwich, 3 beers $60.00 not including tip a little steep for bar food", 
      "My favorite place in town. \u00a0I started going there because I live close by. \u00a0The food is excellent - slightly creative pub style. \u00a0Excellent beer selection - rotating taps mean you'll always find something new. \u00a0Waitstaff seem to have been turning over a lot lately, which can lead to inconsistent service. \u00a0Usually good, though.", 
      "When I lived in Urbana, Crane Alley was one of the decent places to go out. \u00a0We knew that we wouldn't be hit on by drunken freshman who would be inclined to invite us back to their dorm. \u00a0Sit outside in the cute alleyway with a cold Strongbow cider and enjoy life. \u00a0You won't regret it.", 
      "Best place in Central Illinois for beer selection. Cannot be topped. Solid food too, but the real reason to go here is if one covets craft brews. Staff are friendly as hell, bartenders knowledgeable, and prices aren't too bad. Thumbs up. A must hit for connoisseurs.", 
      "i'd give this place 5 stars, but there's this dude named stern who always goes there. \u00a0JEEZUZ!", 
      "Don't order the fish here, it's clearly frozen, not fresh. I've been to this restaurant several times with groups. While there's a decent drink/beer selection, it seems like most of the time alot of the food items on the menu are not available. The one thing I do love about this place is their sweet potato fries, which is topped with brown sugar. This is definately more of a bar + snacks kind of place and not so much a sit-down restaurant though they try. And as far as bars go, there are less expensive and better, elsewhere in town.", 
      "Awesome range of food and beer and the atmosphere is nice. This place has to be one of my top 5 in Champaign-Urbana, especially in the summer when you can sit in the actual alley itself. Not to mention, this place is great for some low-key billiards and beer after dinner.", 
      "I like the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich here. I also like the selection of beers and flights. Real chill place to go and kick it with some buddies or to start off a night.", 
      "I love this place! The food is surprisingly good. Since I have a dairy allergy, I stick to the turkey pita club and its delicious every time. Also good - hummus, calamari, soup of the day every time, onion rings, bbq bacon burger! \u00a0Don't let the pool tables fool you; this is a classy joint.", 
      "Goat cheese and hummus appetizers were great. So were the sweet potato fries. The regular fries? Meh. If i was better at billards, I'd come here more often. However, this place has a really chill ambience where you can just relax at the bar. Sort of like B Street Billards in San Mateo, CA if you know what I mean.", 
      "the first time i came to crane alley i had trouble finishing my beer in the smoke haven that is the outside seating section of the bar. \u00a0i'm pretty sure i nearly died that night.the second time i came, i ordered one of their incredibly over-priced martinis and it tasted like triaminic. no joke. \u00a0when i told the server that it was awful he brought me some sprite to put in it and said it was all he could do. \u00a0believe it or not the sprite made it soooo much worse. \u00a0luckily my face was so contorted with the bad taste it convinced the server to go against bar policy and bring me something else. \u00a0i had to pay for my new drink...but luckily he took the first one off my tab. \u00a0the third time i came i had the potato pancakes and fell in love. yumyumyum.in summation, crane alley is a good place, i always go back. \u00a0but like many places in urbana and champaign, its can be a hit or miss, you just have to be willing to take the chance. \u00a0i would however stick with the large and in charge beer menu and the more common mixed beverages. \u00a0the martinis are way over-priced and i just never every want to taste triaminic spiked with vodka again, thankyoumuch.", 
      "I'm not usually at Crane for food but eat there occasionally & enjoy whatever I order. The drink selection is exceptional, especially beers. The drafts are rotated frequently & are a little pricey but not unexpectedly so. Overall, a great place for a couple beers on the patio!", 
      "Love Crane Alley ----Huge selection of beers and they make excellent cocktails. The atmosphere is mellow and causal and in nice weather, there is great seating outside. 3 pool tables in the main floor along with a long bar and plenty of seating. The food is surprisingly excellent bar fare. I was expecting the food to be okay and was pleasantly surprised. I frequent Crane Alley every week and my favorites are their burgers and their fish sandwich!They are a bit pricey but for what you get in terms of quality and atmosphere I think it is a good deal.", 
      "Great draft beer selection. Try the Blackened Tuna on Pita Bread. \u00a0It was perfectly done, seared rare.", 
      "In the summer you can sit at outdoor tables in the alley. I love that you can sit outside with your dog. They even bring out a bowl of water for your pup. This coupled with the draft beers makes it one of my favorites.They have a huge selection of beers and rotation of drafts. The drink menu is like a small novel. If you can't decide the servers/bartenders are knowledgeable and will help you make a choice. \u00a0 I have ordered food here a couple of times and was amazed at how good everything was."

      "A dear bakery & cafe in the nice part of Champaign. Enjoyed a breakfast here and was pleasantly surprised with the quality and prices. The interior is clean and there is decent amount of space without some outdoor seating. Cashiers were nice and friendly.We enjoyed two crepes, a quiche, and a soup for breakfast. I really liked the quiche here. It's more eggy like an omelet but it was very aromatic with the bacon on the bottom. I think I ordered the Florentine quiche? The crepes are nice as well. It's not a very thin, delicate crepe, but I really liked the sweet cream inside along with the fruit. Its stuffed with the cream and what's nice is that it wasn't too sweet and it had a hint of acidity. I would skip the tomato soup with gouda here. It was too heavy in my taste - almost like a sauce. It does come with a lot of bread though.With it's price point, I'd definitely want to come back when I have the chance!", 
      "In all of the lists of must-visit spots in Chambana that I've found Pekara always makes an appearance and for good reason. Upon entering, I was greeted by the friendly cashier. When I asked for her recommendations she gladly offered a variety of her favorite treats and then gave me adequate time to decide what I'd like to try for myself.After much deliberation, I went with the scotch oatmeal cookie that the lovely cashier recommended along with an iced coffee. Just a heads up for anyone interested, their oatmeal cookies are the real deal, made with shortening and lots of love. So while the cookie was the perfect balance of \"crunchy AND chewy\" that the cashier promised it would be, this treat definitely serves as a more once in a while splurge in my book. There were a number of other delicious looking pastries, tiramisu, and cakes on display; it really was tough to choose!My total came to $3.25 which I thought was extremely affordable considering the use of local ingredients and the fact that, at some other coffee shops in town, you'd pay that much alone for a cookie or a coffee separately.I thoroughly enjoyed my cookie, but I also just really enjoyed the space. The noise level was prime for sitting down and getting some studying and busywork done on a lazy Friday late afternoon.The combination of friendly and accommodating staff, delicious products, and the cool bakery/coffee shop ambiance give Pekara a thumbs up in my book. I definitely hope to be back in the next week or two!", 
      "I ordered a bagel with egg and feta sandwich. I expected it to be pretty plain, just something to eat for a snack or whatever, but when it came I was amazed with how good the bagel was. I was like \"hold up homie, does that say bakery on the wall? Wowzas they made this bagel here from scratch. That's amazing. Can't wait to yelp review this\"And here I am, reviewing it. It was good. The stuff they bake is awesome.", 
      "Service is friendly and prompt and willing to give recommendations to customers, wifi is usually functional, and their chai lattes are a zillion times better than the ones I've had at Aroma or Espresso Royale in town. Kopi's is on par for comparison, but I think I like Pekara's more because it's served in a porcelain cup...something about it is more pleasant that way. The bakery is delicious, but the sandwiches are a little too salty/heavy for my taste. The same goes for the soups; tasty, but way too rich and creamy. That's a preference thing and I'm sure many people will like it, but just in case others are sensitive to textures, there it is.Overall, it's not a super-special kinda coffee shop, but for downtown Champaign, it does well, and its a local business with awesome staff that I feel really good about supporting. I also think it trumps downtown urbana shops by a long shot; looking at you Flying Machine.", 
      "Very accommodating and good tasting eggs. \u00a0I stayed at the Hilton during homecoming week and I'm gluten & dairy free. \u00a0All I wanted was some poached or scrambled eggs that didn't have dairy in them. \u00a0This was very hard to find at 7 am on a Saturday. \u00a0This place made a special order for me and they were delicious, served with some spinach and organic eggs. \u00a0The people were very nice, high quality food, fast service and reasonably priced. \u00a0If I'm in town again I would go there in a moment.", 
      "This review is based not on a dining experience, but as a coffeeshop experience.I've been to Pekara several times in an attempt to have coffee and \u00a0work. I keep trying because I like the atmosphere more than Aroma or Kopi. \u00a0But, the wireless is always spotty. Most recently, last Friday night, the wifi wasn't working at all. We talked to a staff member, and she tried to reset it, but it never ended up working, and we ended up leaving. \u00a0The frustrating part is that we had made several purchases, were clearly there to work, and there was no indication prior to ordering that the wifi was having any problems. \u00a0I think that in these cases, if wifi is faulty, customers should be given notification before they settle in. This has happened at least twice now.I ordered a pumpkin latte, which was tasty. \u00a0The sugar cookie tasted too much like almond extract for my preferences. \u00a0I prefer purer tasting sugar cookies.I might return to Pekara in the future for bread or to have a drink when I don't need the Internet to work.", 
      "Good quality food fairly priced. What more could you ask. Great place to stop in and have a bite. Their bread is excellent.", 
      "Had a tuna sandwich, which was OK, and a cup of flat coffee that I didn't finish. \u00a0This was $9.50... a bit steep. The layout is awful... the kitchen bisects the seating area, and all of the kitchen noise is audible (read: deafening) in the seating areas. \u00a0I asked for milk in coffee and was told the half and half was behind me. \u00a0Half and Half is the farthest thing from milk in the universe. Won't be back.", 
      "I went here for brunch just last week. Great ambience, great staff and amazing food. What more can you want? We ordered a savory crepe and omelette to share. Everything went swimmingly, from the fresh bread samples at the register, to the lightning fast service and readily available condiments. Best of all, Pekara is big on natural food, so you feel quite healthy after a meal here.I really enjoy their gorgeous backyard with great outdoor seating.", 
      "I needed a baguette to go along with a stew I had made, and this place held one for me until I could come to get it later that day. I appreciated that to the highest.", 
      "You want to get their crepes because they add value to your digestive system. I had a sandwich and it was alright.", 
      "Pekara seems to be one of those restaurants that lacks a true identity. It's a bit more upscale in atmosphere and food choices, but the food isn't exactly gourmet. All the items I tried, from bakery goods to omelettes weren't bad but they weren't great (for the price) either. With that said, there's also a lack of upscale cafe/bakeries in general in the area so it's not a bad place to visit for breakfast if you're around.", 
      "I bought a chocolate cake with buttercream frosting for a birthday party. \u00a0The frosting tasted like it was 100% Crisco with no butter. \u00a0I am not exaggerating. \u00a0Do people really enjoy frosting that tastes like that?I have been to Pekara maybe 10 times in the past five years. \u00a0Their bread is good. \u00a0Their muffins and omelettes are okay. \u00a0The ambiance is all right and I've never had bad service.But overall, you can just tell that they must use a lot of lard and/or other cheap ingredients in a lot of their baked goods. \u00a0Seriously, I don't know how they stay in business.", 
      "Wow. Love the cinnamon rolls here. Microwave for fourth seconds in the back...? That seems uncouth, but whatever. Great icing. Great texture. It's a good breakfast spot. Come. Their quiche are huge, too.", 
      "This review is not about the baked goods. I am reviewing the \"bistro\" here. The \"bakery\" is fine.The sandwiches here are so obscenely over-priced. I don't understand how they manage to make everything so plain and unappetizing. I ordered a \"ham and cheese melt\" that had ham and melted cheese on sourdough. The sourdough was vaguely stale and warm, but it was not clear that it had been toasted. The cheese had been melted on the bread, not the meat; there was a single, sad slice that didn't even cover all of the sourdough. The ham was overly salty, cut thick. Nothing else comes on the sandwich -- the bread isn't clearly buttered, pressed, or anything. No condiments. Just generally unappetizing. In retrospect I should have asked for a refund.This is the most recent sandwich disappointment. I don't think I'll make the mistake of getting anything that isn't pure sugar again.", 
      "First, the things Pekara does well. I frequently encounter quiche with an unappetizing dense, crumbling texture, so I was absolutely over the moon when I discovered Pekara's quiche lorraine--instead of a piece of dried-out egg cake, the filling is so superbly soft and velvety that it literally melts in your mouth. At the Urbana farmers' market, I'll stop by their stall and pick up a filled croissant, which are always crisp and flaky beyond belief (not the sad, soggy pastries that croissants can sometimes be). I also crave their savory roasted red pepper and Gouda soup--but I bet they buy it packaged from some wholesaler as I've eaten nearly identical versions at several other places in town.Next, the things I'm not so happy with. One morning I decided to stop in and pick up some treats for my workplace's coffee hour. Thinking it'd probably be a good bulk investment, I opted for a loaf of the pumpkin bread, which came out to more than $10. I've been able to pick up a loaf at other bakeries in town for around $5, so I was admittedly shocked, especially because the bread was very dry and not particularly special in any way. Some of their baked goods are fairly inconsistent in quality--so much that I've sometimes wondered if they switched owners/bakers. Recently, they've made attempts to introduce some of the classic items you'd see in a New York Italian bakery, but unfortunately their attempts lack heart. It's as if some of the cookies weren't properly taste-tested before making it to the shelves.For Pekara, I'd recommend the savory items (omelettes, sandwiches, salads, quiches) over the sweets.", 
      "Pekara's got a hippie sort of charm that I'm down for, and some DELICIOUS sandwiches. \u00a0Yes, the caps are necessary. \u00a0The best part? \u00a0They serve coffee in a series of mismatched store-owned mugs. \u00a0That makes me very happy, and it's far less wasteful than say a Starbucks which would just make a thousand disposable goods.I did get elbowed aside by a pushy older Caucasian gentleman who then glared at me for half of my coffee experience, but his class privilege is not the fault of Pekara (or is it....!?), so no stars lost there.I like you Pekara, and I see you and I having a delicious sandwichy future.", 
      "Pekara has recently become my go-to spot if I want to spend a few hours sitting downtown. The coffee is good, the service is friendly, and there's a great selection of food whether you are looking for a snack, a meal, or something sweet.The crepes and the omelets here are outstanding! Especially the vegetarian options. And all the pastries and baked-good I've had are delicious.There are a few tables out front and a patio in the back if you want to sit outside. In the back, they have a couch and an armchair and a taller table that works well for small groups.The only weird thing is that they don't bring cutlery out when you order the food so unless you think ahead, you have to walk back over to the counter. Not a big deal, but it would be a nice thing for them to do.", 
      "This is the kind of high-quality bakery that you find in cities. \u00a0Everything that I've had here is good. \u00a0Their bread is sooo fluffy. \u00a0The soup is great, I tried the cheesy broccoli (I love broccoli). \u00a0The coffee is fine, not amazing, but not bad. \u00a0I also like the random assortment of mugs that you get to pick from.They just got bagels here! \u00a0And they look like the real boiled thing! \u00a0Who else understands how big of a deal this is in urbana champaign? \u00a0The hours of 7-7pm also make it perfect for a real breakfast place. Free wifi and the fact that it's relatively empty on weekdays (unfortunately for them) makes it a fantastic place to work or power-study. \u00a0The caffeine + excellent sugar filled pastries keep you going.", 
      "I absolutely adore this place for the following reasons: a) inexpensive, quality coffee, easily the best value in the Chambana area, b) deliiiiccciiiouuus pastries!!!! \u00a0Think fruit tarts, chocolate raspberry cake...yum yum, c) decent, wide selection of foods; besides the usual soup, sandwich, salad coffee shop fare, they also have some serviceable crepes, and d) lots of seating, with smaller 2 person tables for studiers/couples, and larger tables in the back for groups/families (plus a nice outdoor seating area in the back). \u00a0Oh, and free wifi as well!One star off for their relatively limited hours...only open till 9 M-Sat, and till 5 (ouch!) on Sundays.", 
      "The turkey melt here is amazing! A perfect portion of soft, warm sourdough bread with turkey, cheddar, and bacon. With a pickle on the side and a bag of chips it's a great lunch. I'm also a huge fan of the black currant iced tea. I've sampled a couple of the bakery items and they're always good and I love that they have smaller cookies for $.75 so you can still satisfy your sweet tooth without having to gorge on calories.Some negatives - inside seating is limited so it may be hard to get a table during lunch. Also, the line can move a little slowly, but the staff is pleasant.", 
      "Picked up a cherry pie for Pi/\u00b6 day. Brought it to work and it was a hit. Love their chocolate croissants as well", 
      "I'd say this is the best dessert place in the town. Unlike the other American desserts which are tooooo sweet and rich, everything tastes right on the spot. 5 stars.", 
      "This place has delicious lunch and baked goods. I love their tuna salad sandwich - the tuna salad is AMAZINGLY GOOD! It has bits of white cheese (I'm still trying to figure out what kind, but it's sooo tasty!) and berries in it that set it apart from other tuna salads. Paired with a fluffy, buttery croissant, the combination of flavors is wonderful!I have also had the red pepper and smoked gouda bisque, which has been on their specials board for a couple of weeks. So good! And it comes with a generous helping of fresh bakery bread.The only thing I didn't entirely enjoy was a mango smoothie. \u00a0This is mainly because it was quite pricey for the quality IMO, since it was made with pre-squeezed mango and other juices from a container, versus using real, fresh fruit.", 
      "Pekara's okay. I think the baked goods are a tad overrated, though they're not bad (and probably the best in the area- though that doesn't say much- it's a long slope down from Pekara). I'm not a coffee drinker, so I can't comment on that. The food was pretty good. I had a Cuban when I went, and it was alright. It's certainly not as good as Radio Maria, but understandably so. Still, I can't help but think it was lacking something. The soda was also a bit flat. I will say that the french baguette was delicious, and I like day-old bread, so it's great for that.", 
      "This is the place in Downtown Champaign that you go for the best pastries. They have a daily array of yum yums that may include some of these: bagels, danish, bear claws, turnovers, cheesecake, cookies baklava(excellent), tarts, tortes, fruit/nut bars, quiche, rolls, and much more. Every one of these that I have tried has been very good.They also have really good daily soups (with surprisingly high prices) and good lunches. Their lunches are pretty expensive for what you get, but all sandwiches come on their awesome bread. They make crepes here that are pretty good, but again, the prices are pretty high for what you get. It can get crowded at lunch time, also. They have staff to deliver the meals to your tables after you order at the counter.Coffee comes in little (one size) cups and is often weak. Get your coffee next door at Aroma, people bring product from one cafe to the other all the time.It may seem like I am way too down on this place for a 4 star review, but for what I am looking for (pastries!) they are solid.", 
      "Mmm! This place is THE place to go to, in Champaign-Urbana, for freshly-baked sweets. Albeit their cornucopia of napoleons, cinnamon rolls, fruit tarts, danishes, pies, cakes and miscellaneous sweet treats, they also have a very nice selection of sandwiches. They are a bit pricey, and the servers could include cutlery with the plates so you don't have to get up and get them yourself, but it's worth a visit for sure.", 
      "Great service! A little hesitant to the cheese the use, so if you're picky about your cheese, ask! Love the coffee barista, does an amazing job!", 
      "I've had the tiramisu here before and it was fab. \u00a0But the last time I went, it was disgusting. \u00a0The texture was gloppy and gelatinous. \u00a0It reminded me of very nasty bodily excretions.Freakin' yuck.", 
      "Although Pekara has delicious food, the lack of attention to getting orders correct may be dangerous for those with allergies.Originally intending to go to Aroma for breakfast, I decided to finally check out Pekara's beautiful display of baked goods. I was elated to see that they had filled croissants like spinach and cheese, ham and cheese, and mushroom and cheese. I ordered the ham and cheese with a cup of cocoa - but they mistakenly gave me a mushroom and cheese croissant. I did not complain since I am an equal opportunity eater, but I know if I brought my friend here who is deathly allergic to mushrooms, well, it would have been bad.The croissant itself was beautifully flaky and tasty - not rubbery store-bought crud. I also like how Pekara prides itself in not using preservatives!However, the cocoa was awful - entirely made of Hershey's syrup that congealed at the bottom of the gigantic mug. At least the drink was beautiful.I know I'll be back, but just for the food. Additional tip: They sell half price day old bread.", 
      "3.5 stars is really more realistic.....My husband and I showed up to meet a friend for breakfast. We were there a little early and said emphatically that we wanted coffee and it was our first time there, and were met with silence and attitude. We finally decided on a lemon/cheese danish and a berries and cream cheese crepe. The girl working there apparently confused \"lemon and cheese danish\" for pumpkin and cream cheese muffin, which she stated they did not have. So I repeated the order, and she got to work. It didn't take too long to get the crepe (less than 5 min), but when my friend ordered, I went up to the counter with her and the girl asked me \"if she could help me\" to which I replied no, I was getting water and talking to my friend. That girl had a serious problem with apathy and attitude. Later, she climbed up into the visible \"attic\" storage and THREW things down (like paper towels, boxes, etc.)The prices could be better, but it was around $12 for a crepe, a pastry, and two cups of coffee. The crepe was really tasty and the coffee was good too, but the pastry was nothing special, I've had better at Panera.", 
      "Ok, so A bunch of us went down to U of I for the weekend and someone we know said we should try this place. It looks nice and their pastries are delicious...BUT...their crepes..are meh...I ordered the strawberry and cream crepes and I didn't like them much. Their crepes had too much cream and the cream was very strong, over powering the crepes. Strawberries weren't ripe, so a little sour in taste and the crepe was just ok. Overall, the taste wasn't pleasing and I will only be coming here if I have to, or for their bakery items.", 
      "A nice place to get lunch or some sweet baked goods. Sandwiches are on nice fresh-baked bread and you can get them toasted or cold. Each comes with a side or grapes and chips. There are also some sweet and savory crepes. Baked goods range from chocolate cake to cute pink cookies. It's right next to Aroma, so if you hungry from studying you can migrate here. Outdoor patio has a perfect view of one of downtown's nicest art deco buildings.Only caveat is the prosciutto crepes...I don't know what type they are using, but it is not the appetizing Italian variety. In fact, it was so unappetizing, that I have downgraded my review. I love their other items, but that experience has made this place less desirable.", 
      "The bread here is so good. Got the baguette from a place that sources their bread from Pekara and froze it. Reheated it in the oven two days later (16m on 375, \u00a0if you're wondering) and it was so good I just ate it plain. Made the best garlic bread from the rest. One star removed for sloooooow service and rather overpriced selections of other things, but man their pastries are good. Sandwiches can be hit or miss and heavy. Ambiance is typical locally-owned college town coffee shop, with eclectic furnishings and local art on the walls etc. Outdoor patio seating is great for nice days. Very walkable location, not so much driveable, parking is limited and metered.", 
      "Pekara is a bakery in Champaign with an inviting storefront. When I got there, I ordered a Ham and cheese croissant, which was good and cheap. However after that, it began to get expensive. I originally came here for a crepe, and I must say that I think their savory crepes are better than their sweet ones.The Salmon crepe that my friend ordered was good, however, the chocolate banana crepe I ordered was horrible! It was tough to cut through, there wad hardly any nutella or chocolate on it, and it tasted flavorless. I was disappointed.I ordered a fruit tart, which was good (you can't go wrong with those), but pricey. And their French sodas are okay, but also pricey.Since the main reason I came was for the crepe and the crepe I had was terrible, I can't give this rating no more than three stars.", 
      "With nearly 30 reviews already, I am not sure what I have to add. \u00a0I think this place has a lot of potential but is rough around the edges. \u00a0I went with my wife and son so we sampled a lot of things;I got both a plain croissant and a chocolate croissant (which they should have labeled \"pain au chocolat\"!). \u00a0The plain one was good but the chocolate one had the bread all wrong.My son got a cheese omelete but it was kind of hard on the outside and he didn't like it.My wife got the chicken pesto crepe, which she said was good.We also had some samples of a brownie they had out on the table. \u00a0You order at the counter and they give you a number to put on the table and then bring out the food to you when it's ready.The location is nice (and there's an outdoor part out back). \u00a0Bathroom was clean.Prices are a little high but there are some less expensive items on the menu. \u00a0Nothing really wrong with this place, I feel like there's more on the menu to try and I'll probably find a favorite. \u00a0 I will probably end up checking it out again if I am in the area after I have tried a few other places on my list first.A 3-star type establishment.", 
      "Their Cuban sandwich on fresh baked bread is seriously delicious, and not what you're going to get elsewhere. Love the baked croissants they keep in the display case--good if you're trying to keep the budget on track.Coffee is decent, but I wouldn't go for just coffee.", 
      "Went here once for lunch with co-workers. \u00a0Seemed to be like just a little sandwich/soup/salad plus bakery type of place. \u00a0The food was average at best. \u00a0Unfortunately, the reason for the low review was the price. \u00a0I paid something like $8 for a sandwich on two of the smallest slices of sourdough bread I've ever seen and a handful of chips. \u00a0I felt ridiculously ripped off, and was left feeling hungry. \u00a0Actually, quite a few of my co-workers with more money in their pockets ended up buying seconds just to fill their appetites. \u00a0It took a little while for the food to come out as well. \u00a0The sandwich wasn't bad, just very average and ridiculously overpriced. \u00a0Soup and salad were the same. \u00a0 I'll be staying away.", 
      "Sunday late brunch - I thought I ordered a roasted vegetable crepe but what came was a roasted vegetable omelet. Because it looked quite appetizing I decided to eat it and am glad I did. Omelets are easy yet so difficult. I don't usually order them because they often come out too soupy or dry. This one was done perfectly - slightly fluffy and moist but not runny. The roasted vegetables were quite aromatic. We also had a chocolate banana crepe which was delicate, a decent portion, and rich. Pekara also carries extravagant cakes, croissants, breads, pastries, and coffee. Relaxing neighborhood joint with high quality food. 2 thumbs up!", 
      "Stopped in for a quick breakfast bite. \u00a0It's a charming place, with food beautifully displayed and a friendly, welcoming staff. \u00a0There's a nice patio in the rear, and the back room with the couches is charming. \u00a0Good coffee and tea, the scone was dry and tasty as sawdust, and the almond croissant certainly looked much tastier than it tasted. \u00a0They have a nice-looking menu, though, so I might drop in if I am back through the area, but I certainly would not make it a point to revisit."

      "Parisian Macaroon (Red) is very bitter. I don't know if it is because of the dye or the almond flour. I can't finish it ;(The filling is great tho.", 
      "It's sad. I had a reasonably pleasant croissant two days ago and was very pleased with the quality of the baguettes. I bought two and they were delicious. HOWEVER. The cappuccino was a piece of mess. It was more close to a caffe latte. It wasnt even a foamy latte. Hardly any foam. and then, i wanted to try something sweet so i ordered a cannoli. yeah. could not have been more disappointed. I paid almost 5 bucks for a small cannoli and it was like paper soaked in water. very heavy in texture. Could not finish it. But since the baguette was the reason I had gone there for the first place, i give them two stars. Want to try their opera and other sweet pastries. but i will just order a doppio espresso. No no cappuccinos.", 
      "I was dismayed by the poor service at the VetMed location. \u00a0After purchasing a pricey Roasted Red Pepper w/ smoked gouda soup, I was handed a cold soup and told to heat it up in the microwave. \u00a0Unsanitary and unprofessional.", 
      "I've been to Champaign twice and been here twice, so it must be good to bring me back. Their bakery selection is fantastic. I had an apple danish the last time I was there, and it was all I needed for breakfast. Their crepe selection looks great, but I didn't have the time to try one; so I will have to stop in again.", 
      "I stopped by Pekara Bakery for dinner on Saturday, and unlike the other (fancier) downtown Champaign dining venues, it was almost empty that night. It's nothing fancy: you order from the counter and they bring the food to your table. They have a pretty wide selection of sandwiches (warm or cold), salads, pizzas and crepes. I went for the smoked salmon pizza, which came with cucumber and dill cream cheese... a somewhat unusual and unexpected combination, but it wasn't bad and it was pretty cheap ($8 or so?). I'm guessing this might be better place for lunch than it is for dinner. I'll probably give it another try sometime soon.", 
      "Pekara has a lot going for it. The staff are really friendly and they have a really focused lunch menu. My favorite soups are the tomato and red pepper bisques, and they've gone out of their way to heat some up even if it's not on the day's menu which is really going the extra mile. I've had their turkey, blt and mushroom sandwiches and all were very tasty. Their breads are really great, too and you can't beat the price for a half soup and half sandwich at lunch. The best thing are the portion sizes! When Penara or Atlanta Bread Co. give you a half sandwich it's more like a 1/4 sandwich. There are times at Pekara i can't imagine how large a full sandwich would be! I haven't tried much of their baked goods but they look amazing.", 
      "This place deserves every bit of 5 stars that I can give as a fellow Yelp-er because of not only its great bakeries but because of the dedication and love that its bakers put into their food! My boyfriend and I were passing by the Pekara bakehouse and thought that it was the actual cafe and bakery and so rang the doorbell to the place (we were slightly suspicious after this moment that maybe we were at the wrong place). A woman baker answered the door and told us that in fact, we were not at the cafe but at their warehouse where they make all of the goodies every day. Despite the fact that this was already a pretty cool discovery, she spontaneously invited the two of us in and took the time to give us a quick tour of the bakery - and even gave us a sample treat at the end (which later, we tasted and it was absolutely amazing)!Afterwards, we of course had to go to the actual cafe and got some more treats, which didn't fail to amaze us yet again!", 
      "Great atmosphere and excellent deserts.", 
      "Had the banana bread again..... warmed it up in the oven.... crack! On a gluttony binge. They also got a great pumpkin bread...... yum.", 
      "I like the crepes here! It's a great brunch/quick study place.", 
      "I am in love with the new Pekara stand at the Soulard Farmers Market. I have a horrible weakness for bread. If I try and go on a diet, bread is one thing that I cannot give up. I love it so!! \u00a0Pekara is now my go-to spot for bread at the market. The wide selection of bread and baked goods immediately catches your eye. In a glass case, there are croissants and other goodies. \u00a0Next the case is a table filled with fresh baked breads that all look mouthwatering. I have purchased the Herb Focaccia and the Baguette. \u00a0Woah, both were amazing!!! The Focaccia had the perfect amount of rosemary and salt on it and it was perfect for dipping in some olive oil with parmesan cheese. \u00a0The baguette had a rustic look to it and had the right amount of crustiness. \u00a0 It went great with the Italian Wedding Soup I made for dinner that evening. The gentleman at the stand is also very nice and I will for sure be a regular customer from here on out! Thanks Pekara!!",

      "I love the bread, the crepes (especially the nutella crepe!), desserts and tea here. I can't comment on the coffee since I don't drink coffee. There is outdoor seating on the sidewalk out front as well as on the back patio. Sometimes on weekends it is so crowded that you can't find a place to sit. Once in the winter, one of the employees brought a table from outside in for me to sit at. The prices are reasonable and the quality and quantity of food is just right. I absolutely love the roasted red pepper soup, yum! The atmosphere is pleasant and sometimes they feature art pieces by local artists. There are frequent buyer cards for drinks and sandwiches. I have yet to feel disappointed at this restaurant.", 
      "The breads here are what you might expect at a good bakery in Europe. The selection is somewhat limited, but the quality is great. We also tried their apple almond tart and mint gelato--both were excellent. The gelato scoop is typical for European gelaterias but small in comparison to your standard ice cream expectations. They also have excellent tables with wifi as well as salads and sandwiches, if you get hungrier.I thoroughly recommend visiting this cafe.", 
      "Great for breakfast. \u00a0Wonderful treats and bread.", 
      "i've been here twice. \u00a0this place is confused. \u00a0my 12 year old son was totally unimpressed after they completely screwed up what he ordered. \u00a0the staff are maybe too focused on the whole hippie schtick to realize that paying customers don't really care about the staff's identities and really just expect to get what they pay for.if you need a coffee and/or food, walk around the corner to kopi.",

      "i'm convinced i ordered the wrong thing. bakeries and locally grown produce supporters will always have a place in my heart, but pekara definitely let me down. i made a last minute switch from the mushroom & swiss croissant to the hummus vegetarian sandwich. (if i was a time traveler, i would go back and order the croissant) i got it to go and was incredibly unpleased when i saw a bag of lay's in my take out box... definitely one of my biggest pet peeves. don't cop out and throw a bag of the least popular chips in the world in there. it's like a slap in the face. anywho, the sandwich itself was nothing memorable, and definitely not worth $8. great bread, 2 slices of tomato, maybe 5 super thin slices of cucumber, a leaf of lettuce, and spread of hummus. that's it? that's all you got, pekara? like i said, complete disappointment.3 stars for the yummy bread, beautiful display of baked goods (that i stupidly ignored), and the biased potential I believe this place has. haha. but negative stars for the bag of lay's, the server who refused to step in while I went back and forth between menu items, and weak hummus sammie. like i said, soft spot for places like these, i'll be back and im hoping pekara wont go down without a fight.", 
      "I'm not impressed with the pastries, bread, food or coffee here. \u00a0Everything is way overpriced and nothing too special. \u00a0I ordered an omelet and got a thin egg tortilla filled with cold veggies and un-melted cheese! \u00a0I still go here sometimes when Aroma is full. \u00a0They do have free wi-fi and the space is clean and comfortable.", 
      "This is my go-to study spot. I feel a little guilty taking up table space, so I tend to try to buy something. Their sandwiches are good- my favorite is the tuna croissant. Their big chocolate chip cookies are also amazing. I like their roasted red pepper soup, but I wish they had some other palatable options- I tried the beer cheese soup and it tasted like velveeta. I would also really love if they offered a half sandwich option without another side.The staff are very sweet, although I wish they wouldn't call me \"hun.\" They seem to have improved tremendously on getting orders right, which used to be a consistent issue but hasn't been a problem in over a year. They play top 40 radio, so bring headphones if you want to study there and that isn't your thing.", 
      "So glad they now have a stand at Soulard Farmers' Market in St. Louis. Just had their whole wheat bread for the first time, a real artisan treat - with great crust, crumb and flavor. Look forward to trying other types.", 
      "Pekara has decent coffee and reasonably fast wifi. \u00a0The crepes are tasty but inconstant. \u00a0Depending which chef makes the crepes, they can range from soggy to burnt. \u00a0Still, Pekara can be a nice retreat from the crowded, noisy campus.",

      "This place is fine, and their pastries look amazing, but when purchased (for a pretty penny) they are nothing to write home about at all. I didn't enjoy their sandwiches either - actually I felt a little sick. My husband liked it ok, so I gave it 3 stars, but for my own purpose, I would only go there to hang out, work on my laptop, and eat something small just to keep my energy up.", 
      "I have never tried their sandwiches before but as far as I know, this is the only place in Chambana that serves Turkish coffee in a small boiling pot. It is not the cheapest definitely but I am just fascinated by it. I just love it when I get to play with tools and make my own food with it =). The atmosphere is just wonderful for studying. The only downside is that it is rather inconvenient for people who don't have cars to stay a little late.", 
      "It was a lifesaver a number of times being close to the Blind Pig and when I am STARVING or if I want to improvise up a few appetizers for guests. They have reasonably priced sandwich combos and I usually go for their italian meat option which often changes from month to month. It is worth trying when you don't feel like something too heavy (Guidos, etc.). A sandwich is always a good complement to your beer too...", 
      "Sometimes Pekara is awesome. \u00a0Other times, not so much. \u00a0I recently purchased a dozen cookies for my staff and they were hard as rocks. \u00a0Utterly embarrassing.", 
      "\"Meh. I've experienced better\".... in Urbana. \u00a0Anyway, This place is really pricey for the amount of food they give you -- delicious, but bordering on frustrating -- let's just say that I am never ordering one of their sandwiches again.Spring for an almond croissant and your day will be brighter. The ciabatta is great, too.", 
      "Uhh Huh...pastry and my sixteen year old loves their Cuban", 
      "The food here isn't bad but it isn't anything to write home about and the servings are small and prices large. I spent $7.50 for a small lukewarm portebella sandwich and my husband got a very small and flavorless omelet with lukewarm bread that was supposed to be toast for $5.50. There are definitely better deals to be had in town. Their bread and pastries are better than their meals but still overpriced.", 
      "I used Pekara Bakery as the source for my wedding cake, and I couldn't be happier. Samantha was excellent to work with, and gave suggestions and guidance about making a cake that suited us. The cake was very good and looked lovely. The pricing was on par with the area at $3.50 a slice (as of August 2013). My husband and I tried three other bakeries in town before we found Pekara, and this one stood out as the best in our opinions.", 
      "I'm surprised this bakery/cafe has not had more reviews. It is one of a very few that actually MAKE their food, including breads, baked goods, crepes, soups, sandwiches, individual pizzas, and salads, in addition to coffee drinks.Pekara has now moved its baking operations to its own dedicated building (now that says something for a local successful biz, doesn't it?) to do more wholesale for local retail establishments (for example, you can find their bread at Common Grounds Food Coop, cookies at the Latte Da coffee shops in the public libraries and Carle on Windsor and baked goods at Pages for All Ages independent bookstore.I like their niche; the desserts are homey, yet professional (and they can do higher level European cakes and pastries). They have THE best spanokopita-type dish (much better than Greek versions-more like a spinach/cheese custard in filo), lovely cupcakes, great combos for soup/salad/sandwiches, and savory croissants. Oh, and did I say individual Babkas? Seating is a smart row of two chair/table setups with plenty of outlets down the hall, with a counter/bar stools in front, and larger table combos, couch/club chairs in the back. Warm weather brings a couple of tables in front, and a bricked patio in the back. The only problems I have seen are: parking (now w/the road closed, but at nights and weekends you can use the bank across the street), and sometimes poor staffing (the owners cannot be there 24/7) although this is to be expected with the high turnover of food service jobs. I have noticed that the past six months have gotten better with a couple of 'managerial' \u00a0level employees who are keeping the staff professional. This is a casual, nice place to bring someone for lunch, breakfast, a bit to eat in the evenings, to study, etc. It is not a sit down restaurant, and it can sometimes get complicated if you are eating with a group of four or more and you want to pay the bill for everyone (getting the orders in and together). \u00a0Lunchtime can get a bit crowded. Each person orders individually and the staff brings you your meals. The food arrives quickly, even the made to order crepes. They do nice box lunches, catering, and platters as well.", 
      "I love coming to Pekara on the weekends to study. The sandwiches are delicious. I love the Hot Chicken Parisienne and \u00a0the BLT. The Napoleon is to die for and the gelatos are amazing. The food is great, the atmosphere is great. The only issue I have is the temperature. They like to keep the place cool, even in the winter, so I like to wear layers. Anyhow, the desserts and pastries are so delicious. I love trying the cakes treats."

      "Great coffee and friendly staff! We went there after dinner so we didn't try any of the food, but maybe we will the next we are passing through town.", 
      "On a quick weekend road trip to CU, I wanted a local coffee shop downtown--and Yelp definitely delivered with all the recommendations for Aroma Cafe!This is a cute little shop nestled in the adorable downtown Champaign area, and on a Sunday morning, it was easy to get in and quickly get a drink and some breakfast. It's mostly street parking, but I found lots of spots right out front.The lovely lady working welcomed us right away, and she was very helpful with her suggestions. I decided on a large light roast Ethiopian and an oatmeal, and the Mister got a large dark roast of some sort and a cinnamon roll as big as my head. The ceramic coffee mugs were huge, and the coffee was delicious. They even had organic cane syrup to sweeten it! My oatmeal was pre-packaged, but it was one of the healthier brands without anything artificial or tons of sugar. The Mister loved his goodies as well.The interior of Aroma Cafe is very cozy, but we decided to sit on the patio out back. It felt secret garden-ish, and it was the perfect setting for a lazy Sunday breakfast. If you're in the CU area, then you should totally check out this place. Friendly people, good coffee, and tasty treats... what else could you want?", 
      "The coffee is okay. It isn't bad coffee. The staff is very friendly and answers questions politely. The seating isn't like your typical coffee shop. It has a nice fireplace in the back and for outdoor seating there is a cool-looking back patio to sit in. They have tons of outdoor seating. They are never as packed as Kopi and it is quieter than Kopi. My favorite drink to get here is the Italian cream soda with the many different flavors they offer. This place has a lot going for it, I wish I could say their coffee is amazing that is why I can't give it a higher rating. You should check this place out.", 
      "Great customer service! The barista was really pleasant and inviting. He combined two bags of tea to create what I wanted, and seemed happy to do it. Casual ambience and I liked that there was a couch in the back. My tea was great and I got a lot of it for just $2... I'll definitely be returning. :)", 
      "Nice little coffee house. Even has a fireplace in back room. Friendly staff.", 
      "I asked the staff what the best flavor was for the coffee (since they have so many), and they created me the most delicious thing ever. It was some kind of mocha toffee iced coffee, and I've been dreaming of it ever since I graduated and moved away from Champaign. Also, their mac and cheese is the bomb, even though you have to microwave it yourself.", 
      "I walked here after visiting Cafe Kopi (it's a 2 minute walk away) on a Saturday morning around 11 a.m.Aroma Cafe is smaller than Cafe Kopi and has an even more boring atmosphere (I also gave Cafe Kopi 3 stars). On the plus side, there is also a work/study atmosphere here at Aroma Cafe just like there was at Cafe Kopi.I ordered the Peach Green Tea for here which came in a red mug on a saucer. I was given the mug with the tea bag still in it, which I appreciated, but wish I was also given a small spoon in order to fish it out once my tea is done steeping. Now the only options I have are: 1) leave the tea bag in there; 2) fish the tea bag out with my fingers; or reluctantly 3) I could go back up to the counter and ask for a spoon...but that's one extra trip too many.My tea tasted fine...but nothing I will remember by the time I leave this shop. Even though I didn't really like Cafe Kopi either--it's still a step up from Aroma Cafe.", 
      "I've been very faithful to Cafe Kopi over the years - however - my beloved chai latte and chai bomb are consistently inconsistent. I decided to give Aroma a try after my last disappointing latte and I was very pleased. My son also prefers the hot chocolate here as well. I recently discovered their hummus which comes with plenty of flatbread and house made fattoush. It is sinfully delish. Unfortunately for me (and my coworkers) it is dragon breath inducing with all the fantastic ingredients. Their lobster bisque is also to die for. Maybe not that serious, but it's worth a try. The fresh grilled ciabatta that comes with it is perfect.Now I'm hungry. Thanks, Yelp.", 
      "What a lovely place to get overpriced coffee!I thought I was in Champaign not Chicago!?I don't get why everything around here is so expensive. I got a small coffee to go and a slice of banana bread. I think it was from next store at Pekara (menu said \"baked goods from a local bakery). It doesn't get more local than right next store! I will say the coffee was great! This seems like a local sandwich and soup place that twenty and thirty somethings visit frequently. I won't be one of them, but a nice little spot nonetheless!You must be a hipster doofus, barista, or bum who writes poetry to work or dine here to feel comfortable. I hate the coffee house culture where you just sit back and steal WiFi. Maybe that is why they are so expensive?I would come back for the coffee but not if I see a Dunkin Donuts first! I also had to help the cashier do some math with my change...but I ended up giving her all of it anyways. Nice staff!", 
      "This is the best coffee place in Champaign. Both the coffee and the service are excellent. They also do a nice line in baked goods, so it's a great place to get a break and a snack - plenty of seating, so you can work here on the free wifi while you munch on your scone and sip your Americano (by the way, it didn't take the staff long to know exactly what I was going to ask for).", 
      "This is a very average cafe with coffee that tastes like a hotel blend. \u00a0The coffee probably deserves 1 star but the chai latte drink was great and the service couldn't have been friendlier. \u00a0Nice atmosphere and great location near park. \u00a0But the actual coffee needs help.", 
      "A fantastic iced Americano at a reasonable price, served by a friendly person, and sipped in a clean and well-lit room where outlets were available in the early morning guaranteed that I could re-write that paper before presenting it.Even the bathroom is lovely.May we meet again, Aroma.", 
      "update 5/8/09Yuck to their pastries. \u00a0Every time I go here (not too often, but if Kopi is crowded or has rudely turned off their internet) their hours have changed. \u00a0Now the sign says \"For Now Hours\" so who knows what it will be next time? \u00a0They didn't have anything that looked that tempting, but I had a huge sweet tooth, and tried a brownie. \u00a0It was hard as a rock. \u00a0I should have taken it back, but I didn't because I would have had to sit their and drink my coffee anyway since I was given one of their tiny \"here\" cups (which probably wouldn't have taken me too long in reality).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~update 11/15/2008:I have dropped Aroma just an \"eh\" rating...Cafe Kopi was horribly crowded, so I trudged back out into the cold and headed to Aroma. \u00a0There was a nice size table free, and it's much brighter in there (which I found jarring at first, but got used to it). \u00a0I ordered my standard \"Grande House Coffee\" and when asked \"for here or to go\" I said \"for here\" because I had planned to stay to do some homework. \u00a0Well she gave me my coffee in this tiny little mug. \u00a0I asked her, \"Is this a grande?\" and she looked at me, said yes, and showed me an even tinier mug for their smalls. \u00a0There was not 16 oz of hot coffee in that tea cup. \u00a0Barely 12 oz would be my guess. \u00a0They TOTALLY short change you on the \"for here\" cups, so I would recommend getting a \"to go\" cup even if you plan on staying. \u00a0Which is unfortunate when \"going green\" is the thing to do... \u00a0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~On an early Sunday right after moving to Champaign, I was wandering around the downtown area to see what was around, and stopped in here for a coffee and a muffin. \u00a0It's cute, there's lots of tables, free WiFi (although I didn't have my computer, I saw a couple of people with laptops out), and the people behind the counter were nice. \u00a0There's a comfy spot in the back with couches and chairs and a fireplace! \u00a0(not sure if it works though) \u00a0And they have an outdoor area as well. \u00a0The coffee was good, and if you buy one of their travel mugs, you get a discount every time you bring it in to get your coffee. \u00a0The hours are great for studying. \u00a0Overall: it's cute, and I can see myself heading back there in the future.", 
      "Amazing atmosphere, delicious coffee and lattes, and the service is great. Cafe aroma is a much better option than cafe kopi, which is not as clean and always much more crowded.", 
      "Under new ownership, Aroma is re-inventing herself as a cozy alternative in downtown Champaign. \u00a0Warm byzantium hues fit perfectly with the charm of the new \u00a0'sexy toast' creations with fillings that range from fresh roasted portobellos with charred red capsicum to wonderfully tender beef short-ribs with a delicate horseradish cream sauce. \u00a0Understated Middle-Eastern sides like hummus and tabouleh further enhance a menu that still includes classic Aroma fare like the Cuban sandwich and quesadillas.Aroma has come a long way in a short time. \u00a0I look forward to future encounters.", 
      "This cafe was a very pleasant surprise for breakfast. Every item I tried was surprisingly good.The organic coffee came in a huge mug, bigger than most soup cups and had a really nice smooth and only slightly bitter taste. If you enjoy Intelligensia I'm sure you'd enjoy this one as well. The Italian soda was pretty normal, using Da Vinci syrup.Both the roast beef wrap and mango chicken wrap were fresh and light with a good mix of flavors. The cream cheese is from local sources which you can clearly taste from the first bite. The sides of salad and fruit were both fresh and flavorful.I will definitely return here on my next trip downstate.", 
      "Aroma is my cappuccino stop on a sunny Sunday afternoon walk. Which makes me neither a laptop-toting regular, nor a complete one-timer. The caps are usually good -- until last Sunday. The tired guy behind the counter was in a big hurry to get on with his life, apparently, because instead of a cappuccino, he made a latte. The other guy behind the counter practically argued with me when I explained the drink was \"wrong\" simply by the sheer weight of the cup. Finally, they redid it, but it was still the worst cappuccino I have ever had there.The atmosphere is nice, and food is not bad. However, the snack selection is practically non-existent. For that, you gotta hit Pekara next door.Odd Aroma Cafe story: one Sunday, I ask for a San Pellegrino. The tall kid behind the counter says he can't serve it to me. \"Why?\" I ask. \"Because I'm under-age\" comes the answer. Wooot! You gotta be kidding, kid. After picking myself up off the floor, I explain it's fizzy water, he asks someone for help, I get the bottle (no brown paper bag) and we get outta there. And with this story, I just realized I am one step closer to the yuppies I'd always mocked. Well, I will suck it up.", 
      "Best coffee in Downtown Champaign. Better than Kopi, Expresso Royale and MUCH better than Pekara and Merry Anns. Coffees change daily, and they always have a pot ready regardless of the crowd. I always get a regular ol' coffee, but people who get the froofy drinks also think that Aroma is on top of their game.The staff is always friendly and helpful to me, though some have told me they have experienced worse, but then again, I know a lot of assholes. The food is good, but their portions are a little small. A lunch with a large coffee is always $8-9. For $5.95 pretax, you get one of their sandwiches and moderately generous side of fruit salad, salad, or chips. They are cheaper than Pekara and Kopi. Make sure you check out their soup of the day, as they are always good and a soup and an Aroma sandwich combo is guaranteed to satisfy. They have pastries for sale, but I don't know why. The pastries at Pekara (next door) are way better. They also have a morning Bagel and Coffee deal for $3.50 that is pretty good: they have a bunch of different bagel and cream cheese varieties.They also offer a discount if your work in Downtown Champaign, but they do not advertise this.", 
      "In a time where hamburgers are cheaper than fresh greens aroma stands out offering a diverse menu of fresh food for a reasonable price. The light healthy taste of the food is paired perfectly with the open air well lit space. Aroma is a restraunt that is something the American people need in order to get our countrys economy, weight, and sense of community back on track. The menu was recently revamped. So if you havnt been here in 6 months give it another shot. My experience today was flawless. The atmosphere is upbeat, well lit, and friendly. The staff is friendly, personable, and knowledgable. The food was delivered to my table in a timely manner, presented with care, and was quality product. I will be coming here for lunch more often.", 
      "Another great downtown coffee shop. They have a nice outdoor patio and a cozy section in the back with couches and armchairs. They also have local musicians play some nights which can be quite enjoyable. The coffee and atmosphere are pretty good. Seating can be a little sparse and when it's crowded, it can be a bit hard to move around.I don't have any complaints really, but Aroma doesn't quite have the draw for me that other downtown coffee shops have.", 
      "I would give Aroma more stars if I could! \u00a0Aroma has a great staff that greets you with a smile. \u00a0I noticed that the staff knew other costumers by name and asked them how their day was etc...nice to see that they value their costumers. You don't get that in other coffee shop in this area!  \u00a0Every latte I've had from Aroma has been simply delicious and perfect to taste. \u00a0You should definitely try the cranberry and brie sexy toast! \u00a0It's taste like a slice of thanksgiving in your mouth...I crave it often! Also try their soups! \u00a0They always change up their soup menu, can't go wrong! \u00a0One thing that I really enjoy about this spot is it's an older crowd not a ton of college kids that are camping out like Kopi so there's always a place for you to relax while you sip away on your coffee.", 
      "This place is awesome. Free Wi-Fi, great array of tables/chairs/couches, fireplace, outdoor space in the back, nice ambiance, and great friendly service.While they play music on the overhead speakers, it's not intrusive at all.They make a fabulous latte (hot or iced) and I am liking their updated lunch menu a lot. This is my go-to for coffee and a nice, relaxing place to sit.", 
      "I was a bit disappointed by Aroma. \u00a0My iced mocha tasted like chocolate milk (was there half a shot in there, or what?) and the veggie wrap was only \"meh\" although it sounded really great on the menu.My drink tasted alright, despite lacking any kick, but the price is really what made it bad. \u00a0For a SMALL espresso drink that didn't taste like it had any espresso in it, I paid $3.80. \u00a0Whaa?I do like that the sandwiches and such come with a choice of side, and that none of the sides will cost you extra. \u00a0At Cafe Kopi, you have to pay extra for certain sides, including the side salad. \u00a0I liked the salad that came with my wrap, although there were a few pieces of wilted/gross lettuce. \u00a0I was underwhelmed by the wrap but would probably try a full-size salad from here.However, since Cafe Kopi is right around the corner and serves way better drinks, I don't know if I'll ever bother giving Aroma Cafe a second chance.", 
      "Its okay", 
      "On my quarterly-ish trips up to Champaign to see a friend, we usually find ourselves downtown walking around. This past weekend we had some time to kill before lunch so we stopped in Aroma for a drink. It was a gorgeous Saturday so we were able to take advantage of their backyard patio. It's pretty much your average coffee shop, but a few things stand out. One - they have sugar free almond syrup. Yum! It's one of my favorite flavors, but rarely do I find it in the sugar free variety. Two - they have a fireplace. I'm assuming it works, although I've never actually been in Aroma when it's on. Third - they have a nice patio. Although I really wish they would upgrade their patio chairs. They have the flimsy plastic kind that suck. Spend a few more bucks and get something similar to your neighbor, Pekara.Their bakery case never looks too appealing. I'd skip on over to Pekara if you're looking for a nosh, but Aroma is a-ok for a coffee or tea.", 
      "I think Aroma Cafe has the best hot chocolate in the area. \u00a0To support this claim, I had a cup of cocoa here, two hours later went to another caf\u00e9 to try their cocoa, and immediately returned to have another cup of cocoa here. \u00a0(I really need to watch my sugar intake.)Nice place to study, great place for a study date. \u00a0There's an outdoor area too, but I have not checked it out.", 
      "I quite like Aroma. \u00a0It's your typical cafe, but they have a fairly wide variety of menu items and you get a good deal with their daily specials.They have lots of seating indoors (including some cushy chairs by a fireplace in the back), and something I especially appreciated was the abundance of outlets! \u00a0There's nothing more frustrating than getting to a cafe that either a) has wireless, but you gotta pay for it, or b) has free wireless, but only two outlets for the patrons to fight over.After ordering my hummus plate, I grabbed a table by the wall, plugged myself in, connected to the free internet, and spent a nice evening relaxing.... \u00a0at least that's what I would've liked to have said. \u00a0I was actually scrambling to finish an assignment before they closed up for the day, haha. \u00a0The warm pita bread and fresh, crisp cucumbers that came with the hummus was very tasty though =)They have a bunch of outdoor seating out back as well for when the weather is nice.", 
      "Nice quick downtown lunch spot. \u00a0Went there because they were included on my WILL Member Benefit card. I'd been there before for coffee - which is also good.I had a cup (generous portion) of the Roasted Red Pepper Soup special and a Portobello toast - artfully assembled open face sandwich. \u00a0My companion had a cup of Jambalaya and turkey toast and a cup of tea. \u00a0There were quite a few customers enjoying the cozy atmosphere and free WiFi.", 
      "Excellent coffee and service. \u00a0Great employees who are helpful and welcoming. \u00a0The grab and go food is a great option for people on the go.", 
      "The happiest staff in Champaign-Urbana! Great breakfast and lunch, coffee, or just a light meal! I will definitely frequent this place!", 
      "I came to Aroma to have lunch and study. A failure on both counts.I ordered a surprisingly small amount of food for about 8 dollars. The quality was meh, and I had to order more to get full. If I'm going to spend 10-12 dollars on lunch, I can have much more satisfying experiences elsewhere.Studying was difficult. The embarrassing light jazz track that they were playing was way too loud, and much more appropriate for, say, a hotel lobby than a downtown cafe.", 
      "Indeed delicious coffee. Had a large cappuccino and an chocolate croissant and both were 5star worthy.", 
      "Quite good coffee, good ambiance, and the staff are attentive. My favorite downtown Champaign coffee shop.", 
      "They changed their recipe for their scones and that made me very sad. \u00a0I'm not a fan of the new style of scones.", 
      "I have changed my mind. \u00a0Aroma, you are my new favourite coffee shop in CU, and not just because you kept me full of coffee and happiness this weekend while I toiled over everything from Marx to historiography. \u00a0Your workers were ridiculously friendly, your huge ass coffee mugs were on point, and the Beef and Cheddar sandwich was sabroso. \u00a0You win.", 
      "I can't believe it took me so long to come to Aroma Cafe... Cafe Kopi was just way too crowded today so I decided to give it a try. This is definitely a nice place, and I'll be back. Plenty of seating (including, I believe, a patio in the back), free wireless, nice decor and lighting, friendly staff: everything you need from a good coffee shop. They have food too (mostly sandwiches, salads etc): I tried their raspberry chipotle chicken salad, and it was pretty good.", 
      "I worked at Aroma Cafe, on Neil between Park and University, for 2 1/2 years, so I can safely say that I've eaten just about anything that could come out of their kitchen. It's not amazing, but it's all good stuff. The kids quesadilla is the best deal on the menu. There's front and back patio seating, which can be important as seating indoors fills up quickly when school is in session. They have music Thursday nights which can be very hit or miss.", 
      "Aroma has delicious coffee and comfortable seating. \u00a0There are big, overstuffed chairs inside. \u00a0In back, there is a pretty patio with tables in chairs. \u00a0Aroma's patio is adjacent to Pekara Bistro's patio. \u00a0So, you can get a latte from Aroma, a crepe from Pekara, and have an excellent Sunday afternoon lunch.", 
      "I practically live at this coffee shop. The atmosphere is usually quieter than Kopi, and there is plenty of seating on most days; the staff is friendly and polite and know their way around a kitchen. There are outlets all along the walls, and free wifi, if that's what you're looking for. *See edit*I'm addicted to the vanilla chai, but I really go there for the raspberry white chocolate scones. I challenge you to find a better scone in the world! Okay, well, maybe not the world, but they trump any pastry in every coffee shop I've ever visited. When I've been on the road, this is the first place I come back to. Aroma is home!Also, the salsa here is amazing. It is house-made and there are two kinds: try the one with the peaches. I get it as a side with my cheese quesadilla, which is also tasty and totally worth spending my lunch money on!Edit: 5/20/2012Since I last reviewed Aroma, it has gone through a lot of changes, including new ownership. What's bad about this is they took away almost every single thing I loved. Those unparalleled raspberry white chocolate scones? Gone. Now they serve bloated English scones from Sweet Indulgences that are as dry and tasteless as the Sahara. Massive, extraordinary fail. I mean, there used to be epic Scone Wars over Aroma's scones--I used to try to beat these elderly ladies who worked downtown to the cafe to get my share. For real. Now the new scones just sit on a plate, untouched and unwanted, fat blobs of loathing. Anybody who likes them never had the original, heavenly scones of old. They're not even in the same category of pastry, I tell you. They offer other pastries from Sweet Indulgences, too, but they're all really expensive and not what I would eat for breakfast. (Old habits die hard.) They still sell apple fritters, I guess.They tried to get rid of my beloved chai, as well, but then the new baristas were too mentally challenged to make bagged chai tea and they had to revert back to the mix. I guess leaving a tea bag in a cup of steamed milk requires too much comprehension. I'm glad for it, anyway, because if natural bagged chai is your thing, nobody in town is better than Kopi, which is just around the block. Competing against them is just a waste of time, so they're safer to keep the chai mix and go with what their customers already know and love.Also, that amazing peach salsa? Yup, it's gone now, too. Forever. The whole menu has been revamped to have fancier, slightly healthier offering. I haven't been desperate enough to try any of their new food items except for the fruit salad, which is basically a bowl of chopped fruit with a yummy syrup over it, and that was good, but it was just for breakfast. I will say they seem to have spared most of their old menu's wraps and other lunch items for the time being. The Wi-Fi is also password-protected now (\"sexytoast\" is the key). At least they didn't insert that proposed \"kid corner\" they threatened us with earlier during the revamp. That would've sent me running for the hills instantly. As someone who comes in here regularly to find quiet and write, I can tell you the very last thing I want is to share space with a corner of screaming, running toddlers. I deducted Aroma a star for all of this, but find it hard to give it less than 4 stars. I've been coming to Aroma for seven years, so I think of it as my home away from home, even if it currently is a shell of what it once was. Some of the other regular customers I used to see in here are thinning out. I guess all of this will make it easier for when I move from Champaign, because now it's just depressing.", 
      "This cafe is usually crowded, and for good reason. \u00a0It's got a great ambiance, it's comfortable, the food and drinks are good, the baristas know what they're doing, and it's in a great location in downtown Champaign. \u00a0The menu has more \"real\" food than most coffeeshops, including hummus and cheese plates, as well as a very tempting selection of sweets. \u00a0The Chai is delicious, but vegans beware, Big Train brand chai contains milk powder (as I learned from a helpful barista here). \u00a0Of course, there is free Wifi. \u00a0In a city of comfy coffee shops, this one is a great recent addition."

      "5 for service. You get this blond hair female bartender, go to her!!! \u00a0She's totally awesome and makes good recommendation. \u00a0Food isn't bad either. Why the 4 stars? \u00a0Yo, I ordered the chocolate de wannabe creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e thingamajig and it only came with two slits of ginger snaps cookies (like the kind you pay 3 bucks for at ikea). I ordered two more of them rectangles and they charged me 50 cents! \u00a0They charged me 50 cents for two rectangles of a graham cracker (remember a whole graham cracker has 4 rectangles). \u00a0Man, as I eat those cookies I lost my appetite for the dessert (rarely happens). I didn't even want to take it home. \u00a0I felt like I got carjacked and I wasn't even driving. Carjacked by ginger snap cookies, from ikea!!! Wtf!? Ahhh, but I'll be back. I'll just stay away from them cookies.", 
      "Food was creative but a bit off the mark: 4/5. Service was super slow and less than stellar: 2/5We arrived around 11:30 on a Sunday morning and were told we would have to wait 20-30 minutes since we hadn't made a reservation. Ok, fine that seemed reasonable enough and maybe would be a testament to the quality of the restaurant, I figured. Time easily killed by a walk around downtown. The hostess said that we could leave our phone number with them, and they would call us when it was our turn to be seated. A nice touch, I thought.We never received that phone call, but wandered back of our own accord some 15-20 minutes later, and our table was ready. We received menus promptly, and then spent the next fifteen minutes waiting for our waiter. When he finally showed up he did apologize for not coming by sooner, asked us if it was our first time there (yes, for myself and one other in my party), and then proceeded to describe Radio Maria's menu: the uniqueness of the Mexican inspired breakfast items, the deliciousness of the omelettes, etc. I think I would have really appreciated that primer if I had not already had the opportunity to read over the menu several times while we had been waiting for him to show up. He seemed really startled when we informed him we were actually ready to order, because clearly he was not ready to take them, citing the drinks he had to bring to another table. So cue another wait...All in all, we saw two tables that had been seated after us order food, receive their food, finish eating, and pay in the before we had gotten ours. Which points to less of a systemic problem (because, clearly, some patrons DO get their food in a timely manner), and maybe more of an individual issue. Our waiter did seem very harried, and I would venture to say even distressed, so maybe there is an issue with the division of work. I did notice that another employee stepped to help with water refills, but during only the last quarter of our meal.FOOD : We ordered: two veggie masa boats, vegetarian Eggs Benedict, Mexican coffees,and a side of beer bread.Rated from best to worst:Veggie masa boats (4.5/5): perfectly cooked eggs, and the masa black bean and tomato combo worked for me. What did not work: the goat cheese. I actually would have liked something a wee bit less salty and more melty, but I was in the minority at my table on this one.Vegetarian eggs Benedict (4/5): I guess I am used to versions with meat, but I could have done with a little more salt or other sort of seasoning. The slice of tomato/avocado combination didn't do anything for me.Beer bread (2/5): really dry and cakeyMexican coffee (1/5): Came with a half-inch of spice grounds at the bottom, and was cloyingly sweet (The upside to this is that a refill of regular coffee, added to the grounds, makes for an actually drinkable beverage).Overall... meh. I could overlook the service issues if the food were truly crave-worthy, but I did not find that to be the case.", 
      "Made the mistake of coming here for brunch Homecoming weekend. The service was incredibly slow. Took over an hour to get two breakfast dishes. I didn't get drinks but it did seem like people were enjoying their drinks orders. I ordered huevos rancheros with chorizo which is something I thought was hard to mess up. After the wait I was expecting greatness but this restaurant did not deliver. Eggs were over salted and the presentation was not appealing. Don't think I'll be back again.", 
      "Visited this restaurant for the first time with my girlfriend due to friend recommendation. And I have to say, it does live up to the hype. Since it was early in the morning on a weekend, we liked to start out our meal with some nice coffee. Not gonna lie, if you are looking to some authentic Mexican coffee, save it. Their coffee was not their highlight. They offered two specials that day: an omelette and a stuffed chili pepper. We listened to our friendly waiter's recommendation and ordered one of each. Their baked potatoes that accompanied the core of the meals were phenomenal! The temperature was perfectly controlled and all the pieces of the potatoes were cooked evenly, and just right. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with just the right amount of salt to make it appeal to the tongues. It is very hard for me to describe the main courses in details, since there was a lot going on, but just know that food is served in a timely fashion, and the impact of the flavors truly made the visit an overall enjoyable experience. Definitely keep a lookout on the specials if you want something more memorable.  The restaurant itself is very clean, and was decorated with interesting Hispanic things that created an unique atmosphere that made it ideal for 1 on 1 dining. Definitely would return to this place next time I am in town.", 
      "I come here for business every so often, usually on weeknights. Last weekend My wife and I decided to go for a date. We were seated promptly, and the restaurant was not full, but it was clear that there were some staffing issues and it took a long time to even get a glass of water. The waiter was doing his best - he is professional and I have had him before - but it was clear that there were insufficient staff working. We ordered tapas, which are deliciously prepared and large in portion size. However, when we ordered the hummus, there was too much to be possibly consumed with the pita chips that were provided. We asked for more, and got a somewhat strange response, \"well that will be another 50 cents!\" \u00a0Somehow either they need to be free (I mean, come on) or make them a couple of bucks, or raise the price on the dish. Anyway, after a long wait for dinner and dessert and the check we were out in nearly 3 hours. I like romantic dinners, but the babysitter bill was a bit high for the date.", 
      "I love Radio Maria! I used to go here with my parents sometimes when they came to visit me as a student. This weekend my husband and I were in town for a board meeting and had a pleasant dinner. We sat outside because the weather was great.Delicious mojitos for both of us. We had the roasted garlic on toast, a potatoes with chorizo and egg tapas, and the filet mignon entree special with roasted brussels sprouts and pearl onions, radishes, mustard and cheddar. Absolutely to die for!!We will definitely return on another trip to the CU.", 
      "I can't speak for the bar and restaurant itself. We went to a wedding party where the party closed the place for the evening.As a party venue, Radio Maria was really great. I love the old architecture and the period decorations. Yet, they have a modern touch also, so I guess you would call it eclectic. When you walk in, the bar is is front of you. It is large, and I would guess that it is very well attended. (Lots of people tried to get in but were turned away due to the party.) They had one of the largest liquor selections I've seen, and they even have infused liquors. I tried the maple-bacon burbon - good, but a little too sweet for my tastes. Their infused liquors are all made on premises. The bartender told me he did it himself - and for the party, he wore a kilt.The dining room is large. We had a limited menu with four choices and we all pre-ordered our meals. I have to say that the salad served before the dinner was really excellent, fresh, simple and just the right amount of dressing. I can't say as much for the meal - I had smoked ribs. They were pretty tough, but did have a good taste.They also have tables on the sidewalk which we took advantage of. Topping the night off by sitting outside, drinking bourbon, eating dessert, smoking a cigar and watching the people walk by ended the night with a flair.If I make it back to Champaign, Radio Maria is definitely on my go-to list.", 
      "When we first moved here everyone kept recommending Radio Maria and I have no idea why. We went there a few times. The service was fine, the atmosphere was okay. The food was awful. \u00a0Everything contained way too much garlic. You could smell and taste the garlic in everything. I think it's an okay place to grab drinks and sit outside on a nice evening, but I wouldn't try the tapas everyone raves about.", 
      "Shockingly I came here without checking Yelp, but I was really happy with the meal I shared with a friend. They have two menus, one for traditional dinner and one with tapas items. Since I like trying different things, we decided to share 5 small plates.Patatas (bravas): Great crispy potato chunks with some fancy mayonnaise (aioli) \u00a0Charcuterie plate: Slightly untraditional plate of four types of meat. Spicy salami-ish meat, serrano ham, duck breast, and bbq crispy pork. The crispy pork was my favorite, but everything was really tasty, especially mixed with the pickled onions. Mussels: Really complex flavorful broth with well cooked and meaty mussels. The toast they came with was top notch, also.Lamb meatballs: Tasty, especially with hidden gems of pine nuts. If you really like meatballs, I definitely recommend these. Garlic shrimp: Four plump and juicy shrimp hanging out on a large piece of toast with a mayo based sauce. I loved these.The decor is slightly art deco, but a little more colorful and whimsical than that. Service was excellent, and I think overall it's a pretty good value for Champaign. I can't think of anything I didn't like at Radio Maria and would strongly recommend it!", 
      "Took my friend and mother here for moms weekend brunch - service was very quick and friendly. Ordered an omelette, eggs Benedict, and egg sandwich. Everything was fresh and delicious, large portions. Beer bread was excellent, as were the mango mimosas! Would absolutely go back", 
      "Addicting Brunch. MANY veggie options", 
      "Ordered off the tapas menu and had a delicious meal. \u00a0Big fan of the roasted garlic and also the eggplant. \u00a0The pictures on yelp are very true to the dishes. \u00a0The service was attentive, but I was close to assisting the waiter with opening our wine bottle. \u00a0It was painful watching him struggle. \u00a0 Overall really nice outside dining experience.", 
      "Came here for dinner and would probably go back now that I've picked a few items that I like. We did tapas, so here' s rundown.LikesFried artichoke heartsArancini (favorite!)CharcuterieSo-soGrilled hanger steakSalmonRaw and roasted apple saladIt was very cold where we were sitting (not near the main door) and we kept feeling a draft. The staff was friendly but not memorable. Some of the items I felt were well-priced ($5-8). Yet, I felt others were very overpriced ($13 for basically four bites of salmon).", 
      "My SO and I made our Valentine's Reservations here, and were extremely happy.The Good:-The goat cheese, the goat cheese, the goat cheese!! We had several tapas and one appetizer, and the fried goat cheese was our favorite, so delicious and creamy, and it is served with a light jam that makes a wonderful combination.-The pork tacos were also delicious, and obviously slow cooked, very delicious.-The service was excellent, especially for how busy everything was (they were tripled booked for Valentine's).-The homemade ricotta gnudi were also delicious, especially with the sauteed mushrooms that accompanied it. -We also ordered a flight of ice cream that featured a mint chocolate cake flavor which was extremely aromatic, and smelled like I was walking through an herb garden, delicious. The Meh:-Personally, I was not a fan of the arancini, to me all I could taste was a fried greasy taste.Overall:-Would definitely return! Especially for date night, it's a fantastic place.", 
      "Order the coffee rubbed filet - you will not be disappointed. I have had it 3 times in the past 5 years and it continues to be outstanding. 3 of our 4 diners ordered it - all had spotless plates.", 
      "Love the decor and the ambiance of this place, people \u00a0working there are great, really fun \u00a0business casual look and really polite service. Lounge part of the restaurant is relaxed and fun.Food is great, loved the variety of tapas and the uniqueness of regular menu, between two we ate like 6 tapas and shared a coffee steak total like $70.", 
      "Radio Maria has the best Cubans in Champaign. The bad news is that you can't get it unless you go during brunch on the weekend. The tapas, however, are pretty good. I generally get the roasted garlic and one of the various meat dishes, though sometimes I add in or replace it with the cheese and jelly plate.Radio Maria can get expensive, and often crowded, but the decor is great and service has generally been strong.", 
      "Why did I wait so long?Finally made it here for dinner and I'm glad I did! The restaurant has an urban / antique feel - exposed brick, high ceiling, and colorful. There were some tables outside, a rather large bar area inside, high tops, large half moon booths, and a separate dining room. Without reservations for a busy Saturday night the wait was not bad at less than 30 minutes. The host and server in charge of the outside patio were enthusiastic and kind striking small talk during the wait which made me excited for my meal! Once seated our actual server seemed distracted or slammed. Between 2 of us we ordered 4 dishes (tapas) and 2 drinks and were full. Goat cheese with pumpkin seeds/spices, eggplant frites, risotto balls, potato/charizo/egg dish = all tasty. The bill came in under $40! From being indifferent prior to dining here I now wish I did sooner. Radio Maria seems to have great drink deals, happy hour, and brunch.", 
      "Brunch might be the best in Champaign-Urbana area. 5-stars. Beer-bread toast is thick and incredible. Omelets are over-stuffed and innovative and completely satisfying. Regular specials make some variation on the menu. \u00a0Coffee is aromatic and high quality. Wait-staff at Radio rarely makes mistakes: they're natural and easy and very good.As for other things, their beer selection is as good as any of the craft beer bars in downtown Champaign (Blind Pig, Quality, Big Grove, etc) but I often forget about it as a choice.4-stars overall only because the tapas menu, while tasty, can get really pricy for the portion sizes. This is what tapas is about I suppose, but also means I don't choose to head here in the evening as often.", 
      "Brunch is awesome", 
      "I went here twice for dinner and once just for drinks.This is the perfect place for a date night- it has a really chill, artsy vibe once.I went here for dinner once and it was very crowded but we were able to eat at the bar. I had a hot pot, which was delicious but my mother ordered something that didn't take as long and her food was cold. They were very nice about it though and reheated her food for her.When I came for drinks, the server was very accompanying when our group wanted to move from inside to outside and had confusing orders.The tapas are delicious- especially the eggplant frites and the goat cheese. You could come here a million times and never order the same item.Next on my list is to come here for brunch because I've heard amazing things.", 
      "Definitely a fan of Radio Maria. It's always a safe bet for a great meal. I always have tapas but they have a full dinner menu as well. I recommend the hanger steak, plantains, and pork tacos. They also have charcuterie and cheese plate type tapas dishes that work very well as starters. The wine and beer selections are also substantially larger than the average restaurant. Anyone visiting Champaign or locals that have never been to Radio Maria should definitely give it a shot.", 
      "Best bartenders in town! Food is amazing, and if Matt is your waiter it is your lucky day!! Otherwise? Cross your fingers, host thinks he is making you a favor by giving u a table (when they are empty), and our second waiter knew we were hungry but forgot to bring a menu. Matt!!! Can you please train the rest of the staff on how to be wonderful?", 
      "What can I say? Having studied abroad in southern Spain for a semester in college, Radio Maria's Spanish flare and tapas menu really pluck at a heartstring with me. I love enjoying late afternoon tapas on a warm summer day with great drinks and better friends. I'm not forgetting the great selection of entrees this restaurant/bar offers, but in typical Spanish fashion, I usually fill up on beer and tapas before I can even contemplate dinner. While they don't serve dinner all night long, they do continue serving their most popular tapas until close. So grab a group of friends and head over to Radio Maria soon; the availability of food at all hours makes it a great place to start or end a night downtown!", 
      "*hearts-in-eyes emoji goes here*I absolutely LOVE Radio Maria. I have only had tapas one time previous to this place, and that was in Barcelona. The atmosphere, decor, and food is downright enchanting. If you want to wow your first date - don't come here. They will fall in love with this restaurant and probably forget all about you. Ok but enough cheesiness, the food is great, even for a vegetarian like myself. I can't get enough of this place. I will say that the service was nothing to rave about - but it wasn't horrible. It also can be difficult to get a reservation/table on many nights - but that's a testament to how great it is.", 
      "I have been to Radio Maria before and had good experiences, but it has been a few years. \u00a0I took my family there for dinner during graduation weekend since I had just graduated from law school.I understand that graduation weekend in Chambana can be really crazy. \u00a0However, the service we got was unacceptable. \u00a0We ate dinner at a different restaurant in downtown Champaign the night earlier and did not have anywhere near the problems we had at Radio Maria. \u00a0Our water glasses were constantly empty, the waiter would go a half hour or more without stopping by our table, he would forget to do things we requested (i.e. fill our water glasses), etc. \u00a0The restaurant is also EXTREMELY noisy.Given the prices at the restaurant, we really expected better. \u00a0Further, although most of our food was pretty good, my grandparents could not eat the hanger steak they ordered to share. \u00a0My grandparents cannot do spicy food and the steak ended up being totally caked in a pepper crust. \u00a0The bottom of the menu says items on the menu contain ingredients that are not listed, but that is in very small letters and I didn't even notice it. \u00a0Apparently, my 90+ year old grandparents didn't notice it either. \u00a0My boyfriend tried the steak and said it was pretty spicy, so it seems strange that the fact that the meal is spicy isn't on the menu.My grandpa also got meat that was not good quality. \u00a0It was very tough and he said it was inedible. \u00a0The restaurant handled the problem graciously, however, and took the steak off the bill which we appreciated.Nevertheless, it is unlikely I would go back to Radio Maria or even recommend it to other people. \u00a0I will be here for several more months while I study for the bar and even though I always thought of this place as one of the nicer restaurants in town, I was really disappointed. \u00a0There are restaurants in Chambana that have great food for better prices.", 
      "So here's the scoop - This is a great spot for two reasons: (1) back-lit bar (with bright blue lights), (2) best Bloody Mary ever.I've been here twice now. Once just for drinks and the second time for dinner and drinks. Although I came for dinner the second time, I was so drawn to the bar that I ate dinner with my friends at the bar. You see the back-lit bar once you walk in, and I swear you will walk toward it like it's force is pulling you to it. It's captivating. Like a kid following a chocolate bar being held in front of him... if you're not drawn to the bar, something is wrong with you.I've only had one dinner item on the menu, so I'm no expert, but I can tell you that the menu is stellar. The offerings are really impressive; there is something on the menu for everyone. The food is upscale in terms of components - you can tell just by reading the menu. It's also upscale in taste. I had the veggie green curry. As a self-proclaimed curry master, I have to give it my thumbs up. Delicious.If you're a \"drinks over food\" type of person. This is your spot. The drink menu is probably 4x as big as the food menu. I would say RM got this ratio just right. They have a crazy good drink menu, and if the blue bar won't keep you coming back, the drink menu will.Last tid bit - the service is great. The waiters and bartenders are really nice and super helpful. No reason not to come here, unless you're afraid you'll never leave (good possibility).", 
      "Our whole family loves Spanish food and since we were all in Champaign for the football game we decided to check out a \"new to us\" Tapas restaurant.When we arrived at 2:45, the kitchen was not open but would reopen in 15 minutes. \u00a0We decided we could easily wait so we snagged two tables outside and ordered drinks. \u00a0The waiter delivered the drinks and took our tapas order so he could put in the order as soon as the kitchen opened which was a marvelous idea! \u00a0Before you knew it we were sipping on Sangria and our food began to arrive.We tried the cheese plate which was outstanding. \u00a0I could have just eaten that and been happy. \u00a0The mussels were grilled which had a pleasant taste but the grilling did dry them out. \u00a0The biggest disappointment was the Spanish tortilla, the traditional egg and potato omelet of Spain. \u00a0This had been prepared like more of a quiche and no one at the table liked or ate it. \u00a0I adored the fantastic lamb meatballs, we even ate the sauce with some of the bread which came with the cheese plate. \u00a0The other tapa I tried were the marinated olives which were not nearly as good as I had expected. \u00a0The marinade was so vinegary, not a smooth flavor at all. \u00a0I would not order that again. \u00a0We shared everything but there were some dishes I didn't try as I had ordered paella for my entree.The paella was really really good. \u00a0It had a spicy chorizo but it did not overpower the overall rich saffron/olive oil taste of the dish. \u00a0The rice part was outstanding and the chicken and seafood were generous and tender. What a treat! \u00a0I had partaken of too many tapas so my husband had to finish mine, now that is a generous portion.We had a great meal, my sangria mellowed me out after like 4 sips, the Illini had won and the weather was beautiful. \u00a0When the sizable check arrived I might have blanched at bit under normal circumstances but my husband and I just laughed and put it on a credit card.It was a great meal with the family but very expensive. \u00a0 Next game, those kids are getting pizza or burgers! \u00a0 \u00a1Ol\u00e9!", 
      "I am not impressed with this place. \u00a0My friend and I walk into the bar side for tapas. \u00a0I had read the reviews on yelp before I went, but my friend really wanted to check this place out. \u00a0My first impression: \u00a0There are at least 7 empty tables and a totally empty bar. \u00a0The hostess asks us how many, and are we here for drinks, tapas, or full meal? \u00a0I tell her tapas, and she tells us it's going to be 5-10 minutes, would we like to have a drink at the bar? \u00a0Sure, we walk past several empty tables and sit at the empty bar. \u00a0We are impressed with the blue light coming out from the bar top, when a \"bartender\" walks past and LITERALLY THROWS a drink menu onto the bar near us. \u00a0And keeps walking by. \u00a0I wasn't shocked because I had read the reviews, but I thought that was totally rude.I asked another guy walking by for a glass of water. \u00a0He was able to ablige, and by the time we got our water, amazingly the empty table behind us was available. \u00a0We sat, checked out a menu, ordered 3 tapas, and my friend ordered a beer and I ordered a glass of wine. \u00a0It took quite awhile for just the drinks to get delivered. \u00a0I was disappointed in the amount that they called a \"glass\" was about half of a glass I've gotten at other restaurants. \u00a0And when I was looking at the wine list, I asked for a recommendation, and said I didn't like fruity reds, I preferred more on the dry side. \u00a0I took a sip of an incredibly fruity red wine. \u00a0Sigh...When the food arrived, it was alright. \u00a0Maybe I just expect more. \u00a0It was okay food, just not as tasty as I've had elsewhere. \u00a0There were no outstanding flavors, or a bite of food that made me sit back and go \"wow.\" \u00a0Just ...average.The waitress asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu. \u00a0Sure, why not. \u00a0We went with the dark chocolate cake. \u00a0About 20 minutes later, we finally got the cake. \u00a0What took so long? \u00a0Who knows. \u00a0Maybe they had to bake the cake after we ordered it... \u00a0Anyway, I have NEVER left a piece of chocolate cake on a plate at a restaurant before. \u00a0My friend said the cake tasted like deli meat to her. \u00a0How does one make cake taste like deli meat? \u00a0I have no idea. \u00a0It tasted out right burnt to me. \u00a0Burnt cake peeled out of a pan, with some hersey's syrup on top to cover the taste.I ask for the check. \u00a0She came by with the check, I gave her my credit card, and away she went. \u00a0Another 15 minutes passed, and she had walked by our table about 5 times. \u00a0The next time she walked by, I asked her for the credit card receipt. \u00a0She was totally suprised, and hadn't realized she had never given it back to us. \u00a0She was sincere, it was just annoying. \u00a0I wasn't impressed with the food, and somewhat unhappy with the service. \u00a0There was dancing (salsa or something) starting as we were leaving, but I wasn't in the mood for it. \u00a0I don't know if I would recommend this place. \u00a0Maybe once just to go... \u00a0but I think once is enough.", 
      "Some restaurants in this area have Chicago-envy. \u00a0That must be the problem with Radio Maria. \u00a0The fusion menu doesn't work because the chef has not mastered the basic cuisines that they are trying to blend. \u00a0Dishes are overly complex and are either bland or actively taste bad. \u00a0The staff used to describe it as a Caribbean-Polish Fusion. \u00a0(Really.) \u00a0I have no idea what's going on now. \u00a0Spanish-Korean? \u00a0Soul Food Middle Eastern Style? \u00a0Masa boats. Frog legs. Ground coffee rubs. Pad Thai. Torta. \u00a0 The motto seems to be: \u00a0when in doubt, add more things that don't go together, none of it done well.This could only be mistaken for sophistication by people who have never been anywhere sophisticated. \u00a0Stay away!", 
      "Brunch!OK, first, we have to discuss the breakfast potatoes. \u00a0As a daughter of Irish stock, I thought I was pretty much over any potato-creation. \u00a0Wrong. \u00a0These were baked to perfection (crispy skin, soft middles) and impeccably seasoned. \u00a0I ate every last morsel. \u00a0Seriously, I love when things look so simple (they are just cut-up potatoes!) are so unreasonably delicious.Secondly, just about any option could be made vegetarian. \u00a0Bonus points for that, Maria!Portions were enormous... but we all cleaned our plates... so yeah, it was all very good (or we are all brunch-piggies, your pick).Our lovely brunch was reasonably priced as well. \u00a0I treated my two friends (yeah, I'm a high roller) without cringing at the check.", 
      "The Good:-I liked the decor. \u00a0It was very pretty.-The \"Soup of the Day\" was Red Pepper-Goat Cheese. \u00a0I could eat that every single day forever and be very happy.-Extensive beer, wine, and cocktail list.-The boy said that his Curried Shrimp was light and pretty good.The Bad:-The waiter was not friendly. \u00a0He wasn't mean or bad at his job, but there was no smile. \u00a0Ever.-The place is separated into two parts, the bar/tapas area and the 'dinner' area. \u00a0The two sides allegedly do not communicate (?). \u00a0You can't get anything from the Tapas menu in the dinner side and vice-versa. \u00a0Our suspicions were confirmed when we heard a waiter telling a customer that no, he couldn't have the \"Tapa of the Day,\" because he didn't even know what it was. \u00a0....What the f? \u00a0Why?!-I had the Korean Hot Pot. \u00a0I was warned that it was spicy, which it wasn't. \u00a0It was extremely sweet. \u00a0So much so, that I had to stop eating by the time I reached the bottom layer of rice. \u00a0It was like a half cup of brown sugar had been lacquered all over the rice. \u00a0Blech!The Ugly:-I got food poisoning. \u00a0Thank you, Korean Hot Pot. \u00a0My guts are still kvetching about you....The problem is, they had so much delicious-looking stuff on the menu, that, food poisoning aside, I'll still probably go back. \u00a0If I come out unscathed next time, we'll see about upping the score. \u00a0Really, a 2 1/2 would've been perfect.", 
      "Falling Fast. \u00a0I've been going to Radio Maria since it opened and have likely gone for dinner for the last time. \u00a0The menu, once a delightful mix of cultures and influences, and the sort of place where there was nothing bad on the menu, has been getting progressively smaller and less capable as the years have gone on. \u00a0Drinks are good, Tapas is \"meh\" and pricey, dinner...no...and pricey. \u00a0We went last week and I ordered salmon which arrived with sweet potato chips - and a huge fried egg on top. \u00a0The fish was okay at best and the odd attempts at nouvelle cuisine were amusing - but tasteless in every sense of the word.In a market as competitive as C-U, I don't see how they can continue this based on anything but location and alcohol. \u00a0Pity to see an old favorite fall this far.", 
      "I don't even know what I'm supposed to review here. \u00a0Is it a restaurant? \u00a0A tapas bar? \u00a0And what's with this sunday comfort food menu? \u00a0Do they even know anymore?I almost feel bad giving this jack of all trades only three stars. \u00a0It's not that there's anything outright bad here: \u00a0the dining rooms are nicely decorated, the service is okay, the food is well-prepared, the wine and beer selection is thorough but not amazing. \u00a0You probably won't be disappointed.But then there's nothing about this place that's outright great, either.Radio Maria was the first restaurant downtown, and they did a fabulous job. \u00a0But now the dinner menu hasn't changed in years, they got rid of a lot of their good lunch menu (in favor of tapas), and they've got this strange \"upscale comfort food\" menu on Sundays that doesn't seem to fit in very well.Even the service - which used to be their highest point - has been slipping. \u00a0As the old guard moves on, they're being replaced with awkward servers who don't know (and don't seem to care) about the food and drinks they're serving.I will, inevitably, go back. \u00a0But since I can go just a few doors down, spend a few more dollars and get an exceptional meal, why wouldn't I?", 
      "Every time the convo about restaurants in Champaign starts, the mom-in-law mentions Radio Maria. Her praise hits often and reaches far. Tonight, we finally had dinner at the infamous Champaign culinary sensation.The food offering was a mish-mash of cuisines - South American, Asian, Mediterranean, Spanish - and seemed to lack a consistent and unifying theme/thread/philosophy. These types of menus are generally red flags for me because they say: I can do a breadth of styles good, but not one style great.We started off sharing the mezze plate. Pita was pizza dough-y, but buttery too...strange, in my opinion. Also, I found the couscous bland. Best part was the hummus, which I was wishing they served more of.For dinner I ordered the crabcakes, which were more like crabballs. Goat cheese potato pancakes were crisp, but lacked seasoning. Radio Maria's Haitian slaw was flavorless and served merely as decoration on my plate - I hate to say it, but KFC's got better slaw! Positives about the crabballs - they weren't THAT bad and you get three in an order. If you order this, ask for extra garlic aioli (probably best to ask for it on the side). I probably would've enjoyed my balls (but, really...who doesn't?!) more if I had extra aioli.Beau ordered the adobo pork. Generous hunk of pig, the orange-bourbon BBQ sauce starts sweet on the tongue, then finishes with a kick...flavor was decent, but I wasn't expecting or enjoying this sweet sweet meat (SHOCK, I know!). Jalapeno-cheddar cornbread was interesting in concept, but lacking in execution...I would've never known there was jalapeno unless the menu told me! Like the roughage on my plate, the honey left his chayote-cilantro salad be.Call me crazy, but I AM willing to try their brunch and/or tapas, but lemme check-in with not-my-bio-mama first...", 
      "Radio Maria is definitely one of the nicest dining options in downtown Champaign. I remember going almost two years ago when I first visited Champaign, and really enjoying it. I've gone again a couple times after moving here, and I was never disappointed.The restaurant is divided into two different dining rooms: one that serves more traditional entrees, and another (the larger one, where the bar is located) that serves predominantly tapas. I don't really understand why they can't serve both types of food in both rooms seems it looks like they share the same kitchen, but that's a detail. I would recommend going for the tapas (the other room is a little more *stuffy*). I've now tried a bunch of dishes, and everything has been good if not very good. A few highlights among the tapas that I tried: the spicy shrimp in chile-lime sauce are delicious, as are the anchovies (if you like anchovies, that is), and the scallops. They also usually have a bunch specials, which I would recommend trying. Not to forget, they have an extensive wine list (including a pretty good selection of wine by the glass), and a full bar. The drinks are particularly cheap (at least compared to NYC prices that I am used to), and I'm always amazed at how low the bill is in the end: you can have a really nice meal with alcohol for $40 to $50, which is a pretty good deal considering the quality of the food. The service has also always been good. \u00a04-1/2 stars.", 
      "Did they forget about an entire part of the building? \u00a0They have a restaurant that is open and functioning, and yet the food is terrible and only gets worse. \u00a0The tapas menu has changed but not for the better.Sadly, I am pretty much O-V-E-R this place until I hear they've made some effort to serve quality food they had been for the past decade.", 
      "I have always enjoyed myself here. I've dined and drank and drank and drank.A few highlights of Radio are: 1) their Absinthe service, which is quite a production. I don't feel like I can really do it justice by describing it, but you will not be disappointed if you order up a couple Absinthe drinks. 2) They offer \"The Wheel\", which is a 3.5 oz shot of each of their beers on tap. They have about 28 beers on tap, and many are the darker craft ales, which in addition to being really tasty, are higher in proof. You need a couple of people to do this right, and there are some \"rules\", but if you are already planning on cabbing it home, this is a great way to learn about beer and get drunked. 3) Their kitchen stays open all night. 'nuff said. 4) Radio is one of the very best places to sit outside on a nice summer night. Get a table at dusk, put your back to the window and watch the night unfold.", 
      "A great salsa dancing club in the evening hours! \u00a0I've never been here for lunch, but the atmosphere is great in the evening. \u00a0$5 to get in and then salsa dancing all night! \u00a0There's a full bar if you get thirsty and two dance floors. Salsa music is played and danced to--a welcome alternative to college kids bumping and grinding while sloshing cheap beer over the rims of cans. \u00a0Even if you don't know how to salsa come on by; you might meet someone who will teach you!I will certainly try out lunch here at some point. \u00a0In the meantime, check it out on a Friday or a Saturday night!", 
      "Once upon a time this place was good... but I can't say that's true any longer. \u00a0I believe that the tapas area is a good bar.. but not so much a good restaurant. \u00a0Go to Cafe Luna for better and cheaper food. \u00a0I used to enjoy the other restaurant. \u00a0They still have good free chips and salsa (that you eat while you wait for your food). \u00a0The actual stuff on the menu is not so good. \u00a0Also.. they haven't changed the menu in the last half year. \u00a0Everything on it right now seems Spanish inspired.. and some of the things aren't so inspiring to eat.UPDATE: I went here for drinks the other night. \u00a0I am not a big fan of their table set up even though the bar was pretty cool. \u00a0I think they must not have very good bartender's working here on the weekend. \u00a0It took like five minutes for them to figure out how to make a rum and diet Coke. \u00a0And it didn't even taste right! \u00a0It was like vanilla rum or vanilla Coke. \u00a0But to their credit, I heard they have good mojitos."

      "A very interesting spot in downtown Champaign. \u00a0A tapas bar, beer bar, brunch spot on the weekends, cocktail bar, and what else? \u00a0I am probably missing something...Tables spread out up front. \u00a0A blue lit bar, and a spinning wheel of taps. \u00a0Strange lighting, and can get very loud later at night. \u00a0Artsy and hip without being completely pretentious. \u00a0Just a little though.Service can be a bit slow, but always friendly and knowledgeable. \u00a0Beer list is always rotating. \u00a0Founders, Dark Horse, Ballast Point, plenty of other US micros and a good selection of imports. \u00a0I think the wheel has about 30 taps. \u00a0Then a creative cocktail menu, which I have yet to try. \u00a0Outside of Blind Pig, this was one of the first true beer bars in the area.Food is interesting. \u00a0A mix of tapas, other small plates, and brunch. \u00a0Hanger Steak is good, as is the duck. \u00a0Not everything is a hit, but there is enough good stuff to keep you coming back. \u00a0Like bone marrow, pork shoulder, and ricotta. \u00a0This is definitely a place to check out downtown. \u00a0An interesting mix of different bar and restaurant concepts. \u00a0Good beer, interesting and often very good food. \u00a0Good spot.", 
      "I'm starting to think these guys spread themselves a bit too thin.At brunch yesterday we were overwhelmed by how many options there were, with 14 regular offerings or so, about eight different omelettes, and then a dozen specials. \u00a0Yikes! Unfortunately, most of us were underwhelmed with the food. \u00a0My wife's Italian omelette lacked a kick--add some fresh garlic, perhaps? \u00a0The two of us whose dishes included the \"house made\" chorizo were disappointed at the sausage's lack of flavor--either spice it up or use store-bought, folks!The mediocre food was made up for by the wonderful decor and overall experience. \u00a0As a Chicagoan with family in Champaign I'm jealous that a place like this exists, so inexpensive, with so much variety on the menu and 37 beers on tap (next door at the Tapas Bar)! \u00a0If they spent some time tweaking the dishes they have and adding that extra something many of them miss, they could become a truly top-notch restaurant for brunch.UPDATE: Went to the tapas-bar portion of RM the other night and was really pleased with the dishes. \u00a0A few traditional tapas but mostly inventive twists using spanish ingredients, like lightly battered asparagus with serrano ham and manchego cheese and seared avocado \u00a0stuffed with quinoa. \u00a0Really tasty stuff, and goes great with one of the 25 draft beers (most of which cost four bucks).", 
      "Great tapas bar, great drinks, great ambiance, great service, just great overall. \u00a0You can come here anytime at all and find something that suits your palette. \u00a0An upscale restaurant in downtown Champaign, Radio Maria has both a well developed tapas bar with a metro, modern dcor as well as your classic restaurant dining area which is decorated in such a way that gives it a more rustic feel.My first experience here was a very pleasant one as we were promptly seated, the waitress was very attentive, and the food was done very well. \u00a0We started off with the broiled goat cheese as an appetizer which was very tasty, and then I got the grilled salmon as an entre. \u00a0Like everything else in Radio Maria, it was cooked well, plated beautifully, and served relatively promptly.I came here again several weeks later for brunch with some friends and had a craving for some spicy sausage so I got the house-made chorizo omelet. \u00a0To sum it all up: *drooool*. \u00a0My friend's said the same thing about their orders (Greek, Italian, and Pinta's omelet, and the egg sandwich). \u00a0Everything tasted fresh and light - just like breakfast should.Whether you're looking for a place to loosen your tie and grab a drink after work, out on a romantic date, or just hanging out with friends, Radio Maria is a sure bet for good food and a good time.", 
      "Nice upscale-casual place in the heart of downtown Champaign. Their menu varies, but just tonight I tried a couple of tapas (fried mozzarella and calamari) and the mushroom ravioli. All were delicious and well presented.My warm chocolate cake dessert, however, tasted soggy and generally unpleasant. It came with a scoop of some oddly flavored ice cream---I think it was meant to be mint, but it tasted more like horseradish. Not the best way to end a dinner; fortunately the rest of the meal was good enough to make up for it.Our server tonight did a thoroughly wonderful job. But overall service in the restaurant felt slightly slow, even on this quiet Monday night when my party was one of only two or three in the entire restaurant for a whole two hours. Halfway through our meal I noticed a middle-aged woman abruptly exit the restaurant despite pleas from her waiter. There was no commotion: it appeared the customer left, after settling down but before ordering, simply to protest the service speed.If I had to nitpick, I'd add that the men's restroom was a little worn and unkempt in the details for a restaurant of this caliber. The lock was also broken. Holistically, though, I had a great dining experience here.Quick tip to first-time diners: Free parking is kitty-corner to the restaurant in a third-party lot. Spaces numbered 1 through 30 are reserved for this restaurant's patrons.", 
      "If you want good cocktails that are overpriced this is your place! Seriously, they had some interesting concoctions on the menu and I tried two of them. They were both fine. Very heavy on mixer. I am one of those weirdos who actually likes to taste the alcohol, the ratio was a bit off. The food is decent as well. I feel as though there have been some odd thing going on with honey on their menu right now, though. Fried eggplant with balsamic vinegar and honey... what? Why? My friend loved it. I tried it. Yuck! Waaaay too sweet. Lots of dishes with honey when i was there last.They clearly know a thing or two about food in the way they pair ingredients most of the time but sometimes it's a miss. To some degree, I appreciate that their menu changes based on what is available, however, I don't appreciate it when I look on the menu and there is only one thing I would consider eating.", 
      "Delicious, loved the tapas and the paella. Very good food, a little pricey but worth it for a nice dinner out", 
      "I am giving this restaurant 0 stars. \u00a0I don't want anyone else wasting their money at this establishment. Here goes:My fellow students and I had organized a fundraiser to be held at R.M. We were raffling off some of our artwork and had ordered a substantial amount of food because we were expecting 50+ guests. Around 8:30pm, there was an AWFUL stench that filled the bar area, followed by a watery mist that began to fall from the ceiling along the west wall of tables. There were a number of people sitting in this area (myself included), who were covered in this putrid water (I had to go home and shower!!!). The food we ordered which was on a nearby table, was also covered. I alerted the manager who said to me \"It must be our pipes again.\" Again? This has happened to other customers? The manager then called the fire department in to inspect the pipes running along the ceiling, while our guests (those who were left) crowded awkwardly around the bar. \u00a0The manager took no action in remedying the situation. Our food was NOT replaced, and the water on the tables and chairs was NOT wiped up, so that the guests could resume sitting. The artwork that was hanging on the wall was also damaged by the water, and was NOT compensated for. Radio Maria had quoted us for the cost of food prior to the event, but when we received our bill, it was over twice what they had quoted. Worse yet, the manager only refunded us the cost of one cheese plate. Thanks. You're swell. \u00a0This matter is still not resolved as the owners of Radio Maria seem to think they owe us nothing. I disagree, and until we receive just compensation, I will not be returning and hope you don't either.", 
      "Food was good, not excellent. Prices seem high for the quantity and quality you get. The bar and wait staff could all really use a lesson on wine - I believe I overheard 4 staff persons who could not respond on their own to questions about wine. Fun atmosphere and decor.", 
      "This is probably the best place to take your parents/family out for Sunday brunch, especially if your family is full of food snobs who don't believe small college towns have anything worth eating. C-U does a good job of disproving this (and at times, an amazingly disgusting job of proving it correct) but Radio Maria is my number one choice.Their brunch menu features typical brunch/breakfast items; omelettes (lots of options for fillings), other egg creations, sandwiches, etc. My mom is a big fan of their crab cakes, and I believe my dad always gets a sandwich of some kind. I always get an omelette, which I always enjoy. Everything (nearly) comes served with their \"beer bread\" which seems to be some kind of beer/corn bread thing that's fantastic. They sell it separately in loaves, last time we were there my parents bought one to take home.The service can be a bit iffy, last time we went our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us as people who were seated later got their food way before we did. But eventually our food came, and he was very apologetic. I don't think this is indicative of their service typically, but from what others have said it may be. Overall though, Radio Maria is not to be missed.", 
      "Please, Radio Maria owners, read these reviews and take corrective action! Do not rest on your laurels because that way failure lies...I don't get to go to Radio Maria as often as I used to. It has a fond place in my heart, which is probably good for them as I'm not dinging them as much as I could in this review. RM was one of the first hip businesses that launched the downtown revival (along with The Blind Pig, v 1.0) and for that I have much love.The last few times we've gone, we've sat outside and had tapas. Now I'm no tapas expert, but I believe you usually order a bunch of tapas and they come out one-at-a-time to your table so you can experience each dish on its own merits. \u00a0RM, however, always sends out all the tapas all at the same time. Everything becomes a mish-mash and it's overwhelming and nothing stands out. \u00a0You also immediately get abandoned by the waitstaff so you have to wait forever to order another drink or get/pay your check. Also, the pretty pretty people who work there don't like kids. That would be fair if we were dragging the kids inside and interrupting the restaurant. But even if your kids are well-behaved and you're sitting outside, you catch a real snotty attitude. I am happy to report, however, that they do have a real highchair. When my eldest was a baby they had a beautiful vintage deathtrap highchair. They now have one that is still aesthetically pleasing, but without all the metal.The restaurant itself is still lovely. I just wish they'd shape up their staff so it wasn't so depressing to interact with them.", 
      "I dearly loved this place when I lived in C-U. Never had a bad meal, although sometimes it was marred with indifferent service of the \"I am a hipster working in the hippest restaurant in town! What, you want me to DO WORK?\" type. Brunch was awesome; a lot cheaper than dinner so my impoverished self could get a fix when mom and dad weren't paying. The beer bread, yes, and the masa boat, yes! And at the time they opened, renovating a decrepit downtown location to expose the brick walls and original tin ceilings was a new idea. They kickstarted a great trend. Downtown Champaign wouldn't be what it is today without Radio Maria. I remember going to that space to pick out wallpaper with my mom and dad back in the 80's. Radio Maria is a vast improvement.", 
      "Great, unique food. Awesome atmosphere. The hummus is fantastic, as is the goat cheese with honey.", 
      "Two words. Grilled plaintains. HO MY GOD.No, but really, the couple times I've been here have been good. Normally, I've only come for drinks but today was the second time I've come for food. The tapas are a little on the expensive side (they are tapas after all I guess) but I think they're very tasty. In a perfect world, I'd like to have maybe 4 arancini for 5 bucks, but it is what it is. Unless you're ballin' out of control, you're not going to eat here everyday. Living on grad assistant paychecks, it's a nice treat to come here.I really can't speak to any of the problems that folks have had with service, etc. My group today came in and the servers set up a nice big table for us. They also brought out some carafes for water which is something restaurants tend not to do.Anyway, 4 stars. Take your date here. He/she will thank you.", 
      "Came here one evening for tapas with friends. I was the only one that ordered for the four of us and our waiter just starred at us for awhile asking if we were sure that's all we wanted. You could tell he hadn't been working there long as he had to ask the kitchen twice about what was in some of the different sauces and I had to repeat my order twice so that he could remember it. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Crostini, Smoked Pork Tacos and Sauteed Calamari. My favorite was the Wild Mushroom Crostini. The mixture of the cheese, fried egg and mushrooms with the crunch of the bread made it delicious. The Sauteed Calamari was an interesting dish with a lot of flavor. It came out in a soup dish so it was great to dip just some of the bread in the sauce. The Pork Tacos were my least favorite as there was too much green onion for my liking.The food was good but each dish was made for two people rather than four. As we were finishing our plates, a waitress cleaned our table without asking if we were done, which peeved me because I wasn't done with the calamari.", 
      "I usually get the Torta Maria. It's one of the more unique vegetarian options that you'll find when eating out. Also, it is something that is enjoyed by non-vegetarians alike.Radio Maria has something for everyone, and definitely puts a unique spin on the usuals. Think, Coffee-crusted pork, wasabi mashed potatoes, vanilla bean sauce on your tortillas...I have fallen in love with just about everything I've eaten here!The desserts are also excellent. Most recently, I tried the flourless chocolate cake, which was no exception.Service started off okay, but the restaurant got busy and service subsided. There may have only been one server for the whole restaurant during prime dinner hours.", 
      "I loved the decor in the new Radio Maria Tapas bar, but I was NOT crazy about the tapas. \u00a0The olives in our manchego baked olive dish had a bizarre citrus note that was rather offputting, and were way short on manchego. \u00a0Our apple blue cheese spread appeared to be apple-free, and the blue cheese spread itself was runny. \u00a0My bloody mary was top notch; I'll have to do some serious research to figure out whether it surpasses guido's for best bloody mary down town.", 
      "I went here for Valentine's Day and was slightly disappointed. While the soft lighting and tiled ceiling lends a lovely ambiance, the food and service did not stand up. It was a very busy night, but our waitress was obviously assigned to too many tables. It too a long time for her to take our order and she forgot to bring the basket of chips initially. We were also seated by the window and the heating was poor. I was lucky I was wearing a warm dress, because I saw people near us having to wear their jackets while dining. I enjoyed my appetizer of figs with honey and gouda and the chips had a tasty aioli dip, but the main courses were less impressive. I had the Torta Maria, which sounded fascinating, but it ended up being a heap of flavors that really didn't stand out. My date's chicken breast was teeny tiny and he did not enjoy the accompanying slaw. The dessert menu was a bit boring, but the pot de creme was good. I also tried the tapas bar recently, which was a slightly better experience. The salmon skewers with cucumber were perfectly spiced and delectable. The balsamic fruit with manchego on bread was good as well. However, the lamb skewers...they were like meatloaf on a stick. The tapas are a good way to try several dishes, but they are overpriced considering how little you get and that I could probably grill salmon and put it on a stick myself. The exception would have been if the little dishes displayed exceptional artistry, such as Cafe Luna's.", 
      "Great food, not overly pricey, and thoroughly enjoyable. Their menu is unusually limited for a place of this nature, but they rotate items frequently, ensuring that Radio Maria is a place you can come to more than once a month.The best part about Radio Maria is at night; not content with being just a cultured restaurant, it become a bar/latin dance night. For this, it gets at least one more star to land at 4.", 
      "This is one of those restaurants that makes me wish I lived in Champaign/Urbana again. Even though it's been open for years, I didn't go until recently. We went for a brunch, and the food was amazing!My wife had the french toast and something eggy. Probably an omelet. The french toast was fabulous. I don't know what kind of bread they use, but it's perfect. She was able to taste some of the egg used, but I just tasted lovely golden syrup and cinnamon.The cuban was served on a fresh baguette. The meat was terrific, and so was the bread. The american fries ( I think) that we each got with the meal were perfectly cooked and seasoned.The decor is very cool, nice artwork hangs on the walls, and because it's downtown, it's close to Cowboy Monkey, The Art Theatre, and The Virginia theatre. VERY highly recommended!", 
      "On a recent trip to Chambana my family stopped here to celebrate my sister's graduation from UIUC and were quite pleased. \u00a0To start, the wine list was decent with selections from the west coast to Burgundy and Bordeaux, though they were slightly more marked up that I've been used to in Chicago. \u00a0However, the kitchen was very clearly overextended on the graduation Saturday. \u00a0While I don't fault them for that I must comment that it didn't seem like they had tried to shove extra tables into the restaurant so it shouldn't have taken 3 hours for dinner, especially since we ordered quite quickly after we were seated.As for the food, we started with the arancini and garlic shrimp skewers. \u00a0The arancini was satisfying though plain, and the shrimp skewers were well done. \u00a0The entrees were bold options that suffered only slightly from less than perfect execution and definitely warrant a return trip. \u00a0I enjoyed the pan roasted duck with goat cheese polenta and roasted beets, while my family selected their daily special (a salmon dish) or the hangar steak topped with bacon and a fried egg. \u00a0As I mentioned, the entrees were good enough to warrant a return trip. \u00a0Hopefully on my next trip to Chambana the kitchen will be less burdened and I'll be able to enjoy my meal at a slightly less leisurely pace.", 
      "Had brunch on Saturday, and it was so good we had to come back for more on Sunday. I had the vegetarian masa boat on Saturday, and it was absolutely delicious. The eggs were a wonderful texture, and it comes with a really great helping of goat cheese - always a plus IMO. Also had to order a side of beer bread and fried plantains, both good. The mexican coffee had a really nice flavor - I would recommend it over their regular coffee.I had the omelet special on Sunday - blue crab, corn, celery, red pepper, with hollandaise on top. Amazing flavors, really great crab. Ordered a side of corn bread (drizzled with honey and orange marmalade), and that was pretty nice as well. Had a guava mimosa - not as much guava flavor as I had hoped, but can't argue too much with a nice helping of champagne!I want to come back soon, especially because we saw these beakers mounted to the wall in the bar area, and our waiter told us it was their own strawberry rum.", 
      "Delicious food, lovely atmosphere. One of my top 5 restaurants in Champaign-Urbana!The roast chicken, fish tacos, and coffee filet are some of my favorite entre's that I've enjoyed here. The food is good quality, and the flavor always delicious!Tapas menu: the frog's legs (mmm, honey) and roasted asparagus are some of my favorites. A few of the tapas items lack flavor; but in general you won't be disappointed.The desserts I've had are lovely; with good flavor and pretty presentation. The portions of everything are very good - not too much food, but plenty to satisfy you.The wait staff has always been nice and helpful, if a bit distracted sometimes. Friendly people, good service.It's definitely one of my favorite restaurants, I go whenever I get the chance, and recommend it to anyone!Note: Many people have reviewed Radio Maria negatively. I think they need to put it in context of local restaurants. We're in Champaign-Urbana, not New York or Seattle. While we should have high standards, we just don't have the variety (and therefore competition) to create a large foody restaurant culture. I also think they need to stop being so negative. I've had a lovely meal and experience every time I've been to RM; I believe you get out of a place what you put into it (as long as it's moderately good, and this is much better than that). Viva Radio Maria! :)", 
      "By far our favorite spot we've eaten at so far in Champaign. Our server was a little strange - definitely new to the job - but the food was excellent and the service was completely reasonable. Very large beer selection as well. Highly recommend - we'll be back!!", 
      "We came here and had the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, stewed oxtail, lamb meatballs, steamed mussels, saut\u00e9ed calamari, patatas, roasted tomato and shrimp crostini, and crispy bone marrow. The mushrooms were bland -- the broth needs to be more flavorful. The bone marrow was also disappointing, the sauces on the plate did not complement the bone marrow at all. The crostini was very average, too much bread and oversized tomatoes for the amount of shrimp rendered.On the other hand, the stewed oxtail was absolutely delicious -- the meat was tender and the broth full of umami flavor. I was also a big fan of the lamb meatballs, perfectly done with a creative sauce to match. The potatoes were well seasoned and the dressing paired nicely. The mussels were served in generous proportion.Overall, 50/50 good bad. This was my second visit and I definitely trust Radio Maria for a night out dining.", 
      "Looking for an omelet using my Yelp Mobile application I ended up at Radio Maria. I was hoping Sam's Cafe was open with a more diverse breakfast menu, but to no avail, I would head to the trendy (read: odd) Radio Maria. Not Maria's Radio, because who has a radio now a days? I don't even have an Pod so I am one to talk about technological advances.We were seated on a Saturday afternoon during the beginning of Restaurant Week in Champaign. They were setting up all along the street for a big festival, so I figured we should get somewhere quick before all the drunks show up...haha. There is a dining room (which is where we were) and a bar/tapas area. Seems really trendy, hipster, and urbanized. You're definitely not in the suburbs of Chicago anymore!I went with the Greek omelet that comes with house potatoes and beer bread, to which I got fruit instead of the potatoes. I also got a grilled plantain. That's a banana (almost, different genus species for all you biology nerds out there).Total for two people was under $20. Waitress was great refilling my water, but she had too much lipstick on and didn't really seemed pleased to see me, which was disappointing because most people love to see a short, quirky, medium skinned Yelp Elite member. Not Ashley, who was our server. Oh well. Will I go back? Probably not, but this makes the grade. I used that pun because I am a teacher who teaches things to people...hahaha.TURN DOWN THE DAMN RADIO, MARIA.", 
      "Had the chance to visit this restaurant on a Sunday night. \u00a0Despite having seated most of the tables in the bar side of the restaurant, they seemed to have only one person actively waiting the tables. \u00a0It took 10-15 minutes to get our drinks...not cocktails, but diet coke and iced tea. \u00a0The waitress was friendly enough when she showed up to the table, but seemed relatively uninterested in doing so.We ordered several items from the tapas menu (no entrees) and other tables that were seated after us received their food before we did. \u00a0I agree with the reviewer below that says that tapas should be brought out as they are prepared, not all at once. \u00a0But sure enough, 45 minutes later all our food arrives at once.The food itself was all very good to excellent, but in hindsight it's the too cool for school attitude of the waitstaff that stands out in my mind, not the food. \u00a0That's a shame.", 
      "AGHHHH This place is GREAT! I'm not as big of a fan on their Sunday brunch though, but everything is great, especially their TAPAS!!!Last time I went there, I re-orgasmed over and over again. You have to try their steak tips tapas dish. Hopefully it's still there. As the steak tips met my lips, my heart began to sing, and fairies and sparkles started falling out of the sky in a beautiful, sexy, and delicious array of love. It was so good, I wanted to regurgitate each bite, just so that I could taste the deliciousness once again. It also had smoked bacon and feta mixed in, which made me want to take off my clothes and dream of simpler times. PLEASSEEE, please go here, and try to stick with tapas, their regular food is good, but their tapas are ahhmazing!!! only downfall though? Pretty expensive-i think we might've blown about $100 on tapas and there were only three of us.Anyway, please go here and indulge on what may be a gateway to a magical land of rainbows and smiles, and angels singing to you as wish that the chef could accompany you along the path of life.", 
      "I used to go [almost] every Sunday for brunch. Phenomenal. I still crave the beer bread. and the Masa boatThe interior is so artfully done. I always found myself staring at the sculptural objects on the walls. And the tables made with old doors. Very cool. (Sadly, I could never afford a real dinner experience here on my student budget.)", 
      "Radio Maria has nice decor and an interesting menu. \u00a0We came for tapas and I got the aparagus topped with eggs and the vegetarian crostini trio. \u00a0Both were very good. \u00a0My boyfriend got the eggplant fries. \u00a0They were so-so. \u00a0A little too greasy and the sauce was too sweet for me.My only complaint is that the service was painfully slow. \u00a0There seemed to be one server for the entire place. \u00a0We sat there forever just waiting to order our food. \u00a0Not the type of place to go to if you are in the rush, that's for sure.", 
      "Awesome beer and wine selection, probably one of the best in the city. I mean, they serve absinthe! The atmosphere is great, very nicely lit inside, the bar its awesome, and they always have some crazy art on the walls.I also really love their tapas, it's a great spot to go on a date. Everything I've had there was suuuuper delicious. I also love their specials and they seem to have new ones all the time.", 
      "Went here for brunch with my sisters. \u00a0The atmosphere was great! \u00a0I loved the massive beer list, build your own bloody mary bar and atypical menu. \u00a0I got an omelet with shrimp, avocado and corn salsa in it which was pretty freaking delicious! \u00a0Sampled every meal at the table which were all oustandingly good...but next time I'm definitely getting the fish tacos!Restaurant seems to run pretty smoothly...service was decent as well.", 
      "On a return trip from the mid west, we were lucky to walk into Radio Maria. \u00a0From the outside it wasn't very impressive. \u00a0Once inside, we took a seat a the bar. \u00a0The bartender was really knowledgeable and there was a great selection of beer, wine and spirits. \u00a0The menu runs from an inventive tapas list to unique entrees. \u00a0We were blown away by both the house smoked pork tacos and the duck breast salad. \u00a0Between the wonderful bar and the outstanding food, we will be stopping back next time we are able to come through Champaign!", 
      "My friend and I went here for brunch. Everything was delicious! I got the caprese omelet, and my friend got the lobster omelet. The beer bread and potatoes that come with the omelet were so good! We also tried the mexican coffee. It doesn't taste that good with the food. It tastes better on its own. It's something you won't regret trying. It's sweet and has a strong cinnamon flavor. Service was pretty slow, but we were okay with that this time. I highly recommend going to Radio Maria for brunch! I would love to try their lunch and dinner menu as well :)", 
      "Awesome atmosphere, creative and very well prepared food, excellent wines and beers, and great service. The space is very well done in a mix of old Champaign with some more subtle modern features. Ate here on a visit from Seattle and was very impressed. My steak was one of the tastiest, most tender cuts I've had anywhere (including any upscale steak house). The gnocchi was outstanding. The prawns with the bacon, amazing.I didn't think Champaign had cool restaurants with awesome food...was I ever wrong!", 
      "Went there for brunch , hot cinnamon rolls were fantastic \u00a0all three in our party had the same thing which was the radio Maria stack. Which had everything you want In a big breakfast \u00a0 By the way it was delicious. Waiter was very friendly alsoForgot to mention \u00a0the interior design of this place was very attractive and comfortable", 
      "I visited Radio Maria nearly 4 years ago with some friends after a Salsa dance lesson, and I \u00a0could not remember the name of this place for the life of me. I am from Danville/Champaign \u00a0area, and I drove by this place all the time in the daylight, and I never even noticed it. It's definitely for \"friends\" after hours.I remember I had the Arancini....holy crap was it DELICIOUS!!! The vibe was chill and trendy. A bit upscale for my liking...but eh, to each his/her own. I personally believe the restaurant needs to do more food advertisement, because I think the only thing that either my friends, acquaintances, or myself believe the reason that this place gets any business is because their bar service on the patio after dark.", 
      "Wow. \u00a0What a great restaurant. \u00a0I went here with my spouse for a nice date on a Saturday night. \u00a0It wasn't too packed, surprisingly. \u00a0They had outdoor and indoor seating, and the atmosphere was exceptional - really nice decorations, perfect lighting, both laid back and classy in its artistic feel. \u00a0 We decided to order drinks and tapas. \u00a0They have an excellent selection of beer and wine, by the glass and bottle, both affordable and more pricey, depending on what you want. \u00a0I had a delicious local craft beer, and my spouse enjoyed some really nice white wine. \u00a0We are both vegetarians and found that there were many delicious tapas options for us, including fried goat cheese, patatas bravas, fried artichoke hearts, and small gnocchis. \u00a0Everything tasted wonderful and the presentation was nice as well. \u00a0Finally, the service was really good. \u00a0Our waitress, despite having several tables both indoors and outdoors, was attentive without being weirdly hovery, gave us good recommendations, and was really friendly.Overall, an excellent experience, and a great environment for a date.", 
      "Went for brunch and would definitely recommend it. \u00a0My boyfriend and i tried the masa boat surprise, smoked pork pozole, and 2 mexican coffees. \u00a0The mexican coffee was delicious, like a spiced coffee with nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. \u00a0My boyfriend said it had a little too much spice for him, but it reminded me of a spiced latte. \u00a0The masa boat surprise was tasty, although I recommend getting a little bit of everything in each bite. \u00a0Eating just the egg and chorizo can be a little bland, but eating it with the veggies, cheese, salsa, black beans and some of the corn \"boat\" is sooo good. \u00a0The smoked pork pozole was really good, although it could have been a dinner item if not for the poached eggs. \u00a0It was kind of like a mexican stew with a couple poached eggs, and some beer bread. \u00a0The beer bread was very tasty. \u00a0We'll definitely be going back and try some other things. \u00a0Radio Maria's has a pretty extensive breakfast and lunch menu.", 
      "Great Tapas. I want to go back for more. Wish they had better hours though. The parking lot attendant was rude. Couldn't wait in my car to wait for my friend to arrive. Made me not want to go into the restaurant, so I didn't. They're so worried someone might park there that isn't going to Radio Marias.", 
      "I came here for tapas after reading the reviews on yelp. \u00a0I love to eat tapas in my hometown and was a little skeptical whether or not this place could live up to my LA expectations. \u00a0Radio Maria did not disappoint!First off, I loved the atmosphere. \u00a0The architecture and style of the place is so artistic and unique. \u00a0It's beautiful. \u00a0I love the artwork all over the walls and the bar area especially. \u00a0The dim lighting and the small bites menu definitely makes it a great place to go out with friends or to go on a date. \u00a0The drinks are reasonably priced and tasty too.I had the lamb meatballs, the bread with fig jam, \u00a0and the bread with serrano pork and orange marmalade and the potatoes. \u00a0I'm forgetting the name of each dish but they are on the tapas menu. Everything I ordered was great, but the potatoes were AMAZING! \u00a0They were crispy and had a delicious flavor because they were hickory smoked. \u00a0They also came with a delicate drizzle of the most delicious sauce, I wish I knew the ingredients so I could re-create this dish. \u00a0I can't wait to come back to have them again!"

      "We really enjoy this place. \u00a0Service is great. \u00a0The Sunday bartender makes the best bloody Mary's and the food is not bad as well. \u00a0We have tried several different things on the Sunday breakfast menu and have not been disappointed. \u00a0We usually sit at the bar so we see all the servers. \u00a0All are very nice and friendly. \u00a0Things appear to move quickly and efficiently from the kitchen", 
      "I think the trick to enjoying Radio Maria is not going there for dinner. The brunch is great. I like their omelets, especially the smoked trout one, I like the potato and beer bread that comes on the side. The omelets are enormous and I think the Radio Maria approach (tons and tons of ingredients) works in that context. They'll make you a Bloody Mary with horseradish which I love. The dinners are another story. I've probably eaten here five or six times in the last few years, and I don't get a lot out of anything on their dinner or the tapas menus. Maybe I consistently order the wrong things, but the food is either over- or undercooked or weirdly chewy or bland or greasy. I have friends who rave about the eggplant frites but they are just a greasy mess to me. The wine is usually fine but most of the cocktails are silly, like sorority-girl/moms'-night-out drinks. There was one thing they had years ago that I loved -- grilled asparagus with a fried egg and a drizzle of balsamic. It was simple and delicious. If they still had that I wouldn't dread meeting people here for dinner.", 
      "I enjoyed the atmosphere and the selection on the menu, as it offers food you cant really find anywhere else in the C-U. \u00a0I thought the menu items were decently priced, maybe a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality of the food. \u00a0I ordered three tapas dishes - the grilled plantains, the goat cheese, and the beef tacos. \u00a0The goat cheese was fried and served with honey and bread and it was absolutely delicious! \u00a0The plantains were pretty plain, but still a nice change of pace from what I normally eat day to day. \u00a0The beef tacos were tasty, but they were incredibly hard to eat when served in dry corn shelled tortillas. \u00a0They cracked and fell apart so it was a bit frustrating to end up having to eat a taco with a fork. \u00a0Our service was absolutely terrible, I had to flag down the host at one point to get my water glass refilled, and she brought out all of our food at different times which was a bit strange. \u00a0Overall, I was happy with the food I ordered and how it was prepared and how it tasted - were talking about Champaign, Illinois, not Chicago or New York - and unhappy with the service. \u00a0I wouldn't tell someone not to go there, because it is a unique restaurant for this area, but I would be warned that the service will likely be disappointing.", 
      "I went with a friend and sat outside. It was a beautiful night and our server was very personable and helpful. She helped us order some things that she thought we would like based on savory and sweet and she didn't mind repeating specials and such for us.We got three tapas and an entree and it was all great.A bunch of people told us to try the plantains. They were our least favorite. They weren't bad... just plain.We also got the fried goat cheese, which was served with a honey sauce and bread, and arancini, mozzarella-stuffed risotto. They were both excellent. We had their gnocchi special which was absolutely delicious. It was definitely worth the trip.It is definitely a more casual place. The servers weren't around every minute, but I really didn't mind. It is pricier, but worth the money. I think that it is a great place to relax and spend some time with some great food.", 
      "I believe they got a new chef semi recently... Didn't think much of this place a few years ago but now think it's one of the best spots for a good dinner in c-u", 
      "First time here...and I've heard great things about this place. First impressions were pretty good....the ambiance was good and the restaurant had a good amount of people. We started off ordering a tapas as our appetizer...the apple salad. It was very disappointing. The apples were not cut to order and were not crisp even though it was stored in a container of lemon juice. The bacon was not reheated...I mean who likes cold bacon? For pur entrees we ordered the scallops and duck meatloaf. The scallops were good however I personally didnt appreciate the jam that went with it...could have done with a spicy savory sauce. The duck was unknowingly served with the same exact jam. It was a tad too sweet for our tastes, but regardless of that...the meatloaf was absolutely amazing. The egg that topped it however was a bit overcooked so the sunnyside up yolk could not be used as a sauce. Our final conclusion is that the main part of the entreeswere cooked to order, as they should be, but all the garnish was precooked and we got the feeling that it was just thrown on...not worth the price.", 
      "I've never had tapas before so there's might not be too much credibility in my review but the food was okay. portions were small and very expense. We ordered a paella ($20) but it came out to be the size of a small tapas so that was kind of disappointing. The servers were super friendly and hipster so definitely fun people to talk to. The wine was really good and the environment was top notch. However, I don't think i will be coming back but it was definitely something I wanted to experience at least once living in Champaign.", 
      "My wife and I returned to Radio after not having been for several years. The service was fantastic and the wine list was excellent. For the most part, the food was good, but there were a couple clunkers. We ordered the a number of tapas, including arancini, pork belly arepa, diver scallops, crab tart, pork tacos, and beignets. The arancini were nicely done, if slightly overpowered by the breading. The pork belly arepa, however, was not made with pork belly and the diver scallops were not diver scallops. I believe the arepa was made with pork shoulder, and was good, but no one ever said anything about the change. Similarly, the scallops were very well done, but were not diver scallops. The crab tart, on the other hand, was a clunker, as were the beignets. The tart was made of corn bread and I don't know that I've ever had a more dried out piece of corn bread in my life. It totally overshadowed the crab. The beignets were huge, which meant they weren't cooked through. They were like eating a heavy cake doughnut, not the light crunchy wonder they should be. The best dish of the night was the tacos. Smoky, spicy, delicious. We will probably go back, but will be much more careful in selecting our dishes.", 
      "Enjoy the brunch here on Sundays but that is usually the only time we eat here. The Lloyds omelet is great and you can sub grits or a biscuit for beer bread if you ask. Good draft beer selection.", 
      "Just felt like adding the fact that I have traveld extensively through all of southern Spain and am very familiar with tapas. The food at this place does not remotely resemble anything I have had in Spain or any other good tapas restaurants in the US (New York, DC, SF, etc.). Everything lacks in flavor and freshness. Bottom line, hate it.", 
      "Radio Maria is at the top of the restaurant heap in Chambana for dinner. \u00a0Top 5 at least. \u00a0Haven't been for lunch and I haven't experienced the tapas yet. \u00a0I LOVE the atmosphere because it is understated and eclectic at the same time. \u00a0I love it when a restarant has the confidence to quietly state its intent rather than screaming \"look at my personality!!!!!!!\" \u00a0The radio hostess stand is lovely. \u00a0And I'm a sucker for their Crass-esque vintage graphic design.Excellent wine selection. \u00a0The Reisling and Gewuiztraminer are my favorites.The service has always been friendly without being intrusive.My food has always been cooked perfectly.I can't say I agree with the claims that the menu is uninspired. \u00a0The coffee crusted filet with espresso drizzle and savory vanilla sauce is not exactly something you can get anywhere. \u00a0I think there is a fine line in a place like Champaign between daring and scary. \u00a0You can tell by the popularity of places like Olive Garden in this town does not have the most adventurous pallate. \u00a0Fennel, Saffron, hearts of palm, plantain, poblano chilis, mole... these ingredients are all \"hot\" in celebrity cuisine scene and at the same time pallatable items for most people. \u00a0It might not be truffles and quail eggs, but it is modern and accessible. \u00a0Oh yeah, and delicious.", 
      "The first time my husband and I came to check out Champaign before moving here, we stopped into Radio Maria's for brunch, it was GREAT! Our server who I wish I remembered his name was fantastic! Now that we live here we decided to go out for a really nice dinner, and thought this place would be a great choice. I am sorry to say I was a bit disappointed, in the food and the service. \u00a0I love the atmosphere there, however that can only entertain you so long, our food took at least and hour before it came out. We did have the baked brie for and appetizer which came out straight away, but then we waited, and waited, and waited for our main entree. Finally I think our server who at this point I was sure had vanished, came to our table and explained the delay. That was 45 minutes later mind you. \u00a0If he had told us initially that our meals would be slower coming out I would have been more understanding, however when you are starving and you see people who sat after you being served and getting their bill and you don't see your server anywhere, you start to wonder what's up.I would likely go back for the brunch, but may try dinner somewhere else, hence the 3 stars.", 
      "Excellent choice. Great and tasty tapas menu with a wide beer selection. Good service that isn't in your face.Highly recommend the pita chips and hummus. The chips were thick, crispy on the outside, but preserving the soft tender pita texture on the inside, complimenting the exceptionally smooth hummus.", 
      "The brunch was very tasty and a good value. \u00a0The dinner, however, was nothing special. \u00a0They had a lot of great choices on the menu, but everything just sort of tasted average. \u00a0The service was good. \u00a0I would suggest going here for brunch. \u00a0Dinner is also good, but not amazing.", 
      "Great place for tapas in Champaign. I agree that it's a good 'date night' place. Coming from Chicago, I find the portions of tapas to be large and inexpensive- which is great! They also have regular entrees if small plates aren't your thing. They had a good wine list, and the sangria was different ( I think there is brandy in it?) but good nonetheless. This is also a great vegetarian spot.", 
      "David S. and I were here for \u00a0brunch today, and it was pretty sweet! They had a variety of options, and a full bar and a commendable wine list. We started with bloody marys though I was tempted to try the bloody maria. My goat cheese, trout and avocado omelet was fresh and delicious and David seemed happy with his tuna, so we made one happy brunching family! Though, can I just say, his tuna was his hunk of meat that looked like a rarely done steak, it was massive. Our waitress was very nice and checked in on us very frequently. All in all, a great brunch experience, I would definitely come back here!", 
      "Radio Maria is trying a little too hard to be trendy, d\u00e9cor-wise--it's the kind of place you walk into and expect to be treated with a bit of a condescending attitude by the staff. But thankfully this was not the case! We made our way to the bar where we were greeted by a friendly barman who presented us with a very nice cocktail list while we waited for a table. I chose the Dark and Stormy, which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it! (I ended up having another that I really didn't need, just because it was so refreshingly awesome.) Unfortunately Radio Maria's website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that I went here on a trip out to Des Moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had, but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average. I'd definitely return here on a trip to the Twin City area.", 
      "Radio Maria makes me feel good. There, I said it. Any restaurant has its flaws, but RM is about as close as it comes to perfect in Chambana. RM is situated in the bustling Downtown, and sports an eclectic modern decor with latin touches. The Tapas Lounge is all-modern, with changing exhibitions for wall-art, and a Euro-chic cleanliness, not typically found in the mid-west. I will talk of the awesome Tapas 'experience' at a later date, but this blog is devoted to our last night in The Dining Room.With an exceptional wine-list, dinner at RM always begins and ends well in terms of drinking options. One of the best things for me is that no matter what mood I am in financially, (from big-night-out, to my typical tuesday-night-budget) there are so many choices of great tasting vino. Although RM changes its menu about once a year, they (thankfully) keep many of their favorites available, such as the Coffee Filet, Peppercorn Tuna steak, New York Strip and appetizers Seared Avocado with Quinoa salad and Grilled Goats Cheese Medallions in pesto. All dishes have latin-fusion inspired flavors, plenty of warm chile, spicy cream, mole and guacamole sauces.Service at RM is impeccable. Quick, but tastefully so, timing is almost always perfect, polite and sophisticated. Their knowledgeable sommelier staff are very helpful for beginners and experienced wine-drinkers alike. Dinner is not cheap for the average mid-west dining clientele, but compared to similar dining rooms in larger cities, I think Radio Maria is worth double whatever the bill is.ALWAYS order the special, their young, fashionable chefs always deliver. Expect to spend $60-$80 on food for 3 courses for 2 people in the restaurant, or $40-$60 in the tapas lounge.", 
      "Brunch was delicious! \u00a0I enjoyed the scrambler - all components were cooked perfectly. \u00a0Loved the beer bread. \u00a0Others in the party recommended the omelets as well. \u00a0Generous portions, reasonably priced and fun atmosphere.", 
      "I'd love to say Radio Maria is my favorite restaurant and give it 5 stars. \u00a0After all, they have awesome sangria and great sunday brunch. \u00a0The fig appetizers on their dinner menu are fantastic, but their dinner entr\u00e9es are \u00a0hit or miss. \u00a0The tapas also taste great, but they always make me terribly sick afterward. \u00a0I'll keep coming back for dinner, though I think I've given up on the tapas for good.", 
      "Oh Radio Maria, how I wish we could be in love.Radio Maria is like the girl your friends try to set you up with. \u00a0You hear how beautiful, how wonderful she is. \u00a0Then you meet her, only to find out she bites her fingernails during dinner.This restaurant has all the makings of a high class experience. \u00a0It has a pretty bar with house-infused liquor. \u00a0(I especially love the ginger vodka.) \u00a0There is a large tapas menu, a full service restaurant, and even a hostess!However, that's where the magical journy ends. \u00a0You enter the restaurant only to be told to wait. \u00a0You may, if you're like me, point out all of the empty tables and ask \"why can't I sit there?\" \u00a0\"Well,\" says the snooty hostess, \"those are reserved.\" \u00a0Really? \u00a0You have half of your restaurant empty and those are all reserved? \u00a0Ok, I'll bite. \u00a0Yes, we'll be happy to sit at the bar and have a drink and wait for \"about 15 minutes.\"At the bar, we order two delicious drinks. \u00a0They're made well, even though it took a little longer than it should considering there were three people behind the bar. \u00a0We decided to ask for the tapas menu so we'd be ready to order. \u00a0Sure, I don't mind that this one has food spilled on it. \u00a0After about 20 minutes of staring at the menu, not having any contact with the bartenders and certainly not seeing our promised table, we left, paying only for the expensive, but tasty, drinks.Will we go back? \u00a0Well....no.", 
      "Good food from a wide selection of ethnicities - cajun, indian, latin american, but not fusion. \u00a0Just all on the same menu. \u00a0Kind of hard to explain. \u00a0They have just about everything - seafood, duck, lamb, plus the standards. \u00a0They try to be inventive but usually are not too adventurous - still, the meal satisfies. \u00a0I think they could let their hair down a little more by putting some riskier things on the menu. \u00a0Good selection of wines and beers, plus margarias and sangria.", 
      "I had Saturday brunch here this week and was terribly disappointed. \u00a0In the past its Radio Maria has been nothing but fantastic, but all they had for the lunch menu was a set of sandwiches. \u00a0Really nothing exciting at all. \u00a0Make sure you check to see what they're serving that particular day before you go for lunch.", 
      "Eh. \u00a0I have some issues with this place. \u00a0It has really good potential but I definitely have mood swings about it. \u00a0The main restaurant is decent. \u00a0The food isn't necessarily anything I couldn't make myself but it is good, especially for me-- a vegetarian, who has had trouble finding interesting vegetarian food at many of the places in CU. \u00a0Also, the wine selection is pretty decent. \u00a0BUT, I think the tapas side is just terrible. \u00a0We've only eaten in that part one time and I believe it was a Tuesday night, but essentially every dish we got had something wrong with it. \u00a0The biggest issue was that we were served the Spanish tortilla omelet refrigerator cold. \u00a0It is supposed to be GRILLED. \u00a0Not grilled then put in the fridge over the weekend! \u00a0We told our server and she told us that was how it was supposed to be. \u00a0Alrighty then! \u00a0Actually, every tapas we ordered was COLD, but this was the one that stood out the most (who wants cold eggs? \u00a0Not me!!).Maybe I need to experience the brunch to give a fair assessment, but for now I'm giving 2 stars (4 for the restaurant + 1 for tapas)/2 = 2 when rounding down).", 
      "After being a loyal patron for seven years, I am done with this place. While they still have some great drink selections, the service has gotten so bad. On a Friday afternoon, I was one of six sitting at the bar. Two bartenders and 1-2 servers were working and it still took them 20 minutes to take my order. With the downtown Champaign scene evolving, this kind of situation is unacceptable.", 
      "I wish I could give the wait staff 1 star and the food a 4. I've been here 5 times, mostly for brunch. \u00a0The waiters are my least favorite part of Radio Maria. That said, the prices are reasonable at brunch, so go on the weekends if you decide to check the restaurant out. \u00a0There are never enough people working at brunch. \u00a0We always have to flag someone down to order, to figure out where our drinks are, to get refills on our coffee, the list goes on and on. \u00a0The food has been quite good; I loved the Torta Maria, the blackened salmon, and their soups, while overpriced, have been excellent. \u00a0The masa boat was a little dry, but the flavors were well-balanced. \u00a0I went once for dinner. \u00a0The food was good, but unremarkable. \u00a0I had the Korean hot pot. \u00a0It was good, but I wasn't expecting it to be sweet. \u00a0The portion sizes were also tiny. \u00a0For half the cost, I could have gotten twice as much food at B-Won.I don't drink alcohol, so I can't say anything about their drinks, but my friends say they have one of the best-stocked bars in town and the weeknight bartender is excellent.", 
      "Nothing at this restaurant warrants the cost. The tapas servings are tiny (for tapas); brunch is inventive but disappoints. The staff always act like you're wasting their time. This place sells an image of Euro-trendiness, but it's nothing more than that image. Go to Escobar if you want expensive food WORTH the cost.", 
      "A grad school fav... This place has stood the test of time, which is the best indication of restaurant quality.", 
      "The sangria here is awful. I think it was a tequila sunrise. The food is greasy and not in a good way. The only thing good was the goat cheese. But it is goat cheese. How can you mess that up?", 
      "LOVE this place, always have. \u00a0One of the few restaurants that is consistently different. \u00a0Having lived in and round C-U for waaay too long its easy to see that many places are often derivative, dull, and lack character (a good example is the bar across from RM). \u00a0I make a point of going any time i pass through town and find myself craving Radio food when I'm away for too long.", 
      "i'm from los angeles, the land of many-a-radio maria - so really, i like radio maria because it feels like a slice of home. \u00a0i've been three times so far, and frankly i have to say that nothing has blown me away, but everything i've had has been pretty damn solid.first time i came for lunch, and had a portobella/goatcheese/pesto sandwich thing, and it was delicious. \u00a0not very unique but good eats. \u00a0i came for dinner the same night and enjoyed the pan seared peppercorn crusted tuna which again was not a unique dish by any means but solidly executed. \u00a0i recently went back for the tapas - their piquillos rellenos were flavorful and the portobello entree was perfect. \u00a0what i admire about the food here is that they aren't scared of flavor, which is something ive noticed happening in fusion-type restaurants. \u00a0ALSO, their drinks are marvelous. pricey but innovative!", 
      "first drink: arcadia porter. \u00a0pretty good. \u00a0decent price.second drink: kilt lifter. menu advertises: \"tastes like a cookie\". \u00a0ok i'm in the mood for sweet. \u00a0when i got it and tasted it: \u00a0EWWUCK. \u00a0completely flat. \u00a0and tasted like syrup. \u00a0not the you-put-on-your-pancakes-good-kind, but the high-fructose-corn-syrup-kind. \u00a0EWWUCK.me: can i trade this for something else? \u00a0it's really not good.bartender 1: what do you mean?bartender 2: what is going on here.me: this tastes like corn syrup.bartender 2: the menu says \"tastes like a cookie\"me: it tastes like ROBITUSSIN. have you tried it.bartender 2 walks away never to returnbartender 1: we can't _trade_ it. it's not like we can serve it to someone else. \u00a0it would be different if there was something wrong with it.this beer tastes like ROBITUSSIN; how wrong do you have to get? \u00a0your beer tastes like ROBITUSSIN = WRONG. \u00a0your cookie tastes like ROBITUSSIN = WRONG. \u00a0anything besides ROBITUSSIN tasting like ROBITUSSIN = WRONG.if i wanted to treat my nasal congestion, cough, runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing, itchy watery eyes, i would have gone to my local pharmacy. \u00a0but hey, at least i got a better deal at radio maria's.it's not entirely their fault; it's my fault for being born as a _non-priviledged_, seeing that i'm not a WHITE MAN donning a business suit. \u00a0if you want differential treatment, go here.", 
      "I use to go to Radio much more often, but lately it seems to have fallen off the wagon. Ok so half off wine night is nice, but other than that I try to steer clear of RM and either go to Carmons for food or Quality to drink. The food seems uninspired and the quality of ingredients is average. I do like the decor of the bar. What happened to this place?", 
      "Another update -- I wish this place was more consistent. \u00a0We actually had a nice tapas dinner about a month ago, and I've grown to really like the beer bar. \u00a0I enjoyed, particularly, the patas bravas (although I'm pretty sure they were using liquid smoke, although if I'm wrong please let me know). \u00a0I'm going to leave it as 2 stars now since consistency we've had such an up and down experience over the last few months, but I'll give it some more chances in the future...", 
      "I am straight up in LOVE with the fried goat cheese balls at radio maria. i was super excited to go and enjoy some of the deliciousness that is the food, however, last week i went in with a friend and we were seated and then literally sat there for 7 minutes before someone came over to us. I was just the hostess, who said that a waiter would be over in a minute. That minute was another 7 minutes, and we didn't even have a drink order in, so we got up to leave (as we were super hungry.) The hostess shrugged and was totally unapologetic about the terrible service, so we went to jupiter's and had some delicious pizza and beers for 1/4 the price of what we were going to order.", 
      "i would give this place 3.5 stars. \u00a0we had reservations here for sat night at 745 and weren't seated for about 15-20 minutes. \u00a0it was graduation wknd, so there were a ton of people. \u00a0when we were finally seated, we could only get seats at the bar, which was super loud.the menu here is not big. \u00a0we started w/ the patatas and the bulgogi summer roll. \u00a0i thought it was weird that they had korean items on the menu, b/c there was also a korean hot pot dish that looked a bit like bibimbap. \u00a0the patatas were really good and smokey.for my entree, i had the snapper w/ shitake mushrooms, edamame, and celery. \u00a0it was really light and asiany. \u00a0my brother's filet was huge, and my mom said her salmon was good. \u00a0my dad had the ratatouille w/ couscous, which was the smallest dish. \u00a0all the other portions were pretty hefty. \u00a0for dessert, we got the tres leches cake, which was good, but i wished it was more drenched in milk.service here is pretty fast considering it is packed and loud. \u00a0there were a ton of drinks on the menu and a bunch of beers on tap.", 
      "This place keeps getting better and better. I have to admit, it had been 3 years since I went back to Champaign but I am glad we were able to visit one of the restaurants I used to frequent. The tapas bar wasn't there when I used to come, but it is an excellent addition to this fusion style restaurant. My favorites were the egg plant frittes and the seared scallops. Hopefully it won't be another 3 years until I am back!", 
      "We came here for Sunday brunch, and ordered 3 things.Leroy's buttermilk skillet cornbread @ $4 - just one slice. \u00a0[Chicago downtown's Bandera Restaurant used to have a whole mini skillet for this price 5x the portion of this, the price has since gone up.] \u00a0With the word \"skillet\", we assumed it would came in a full skillet (even a small one, but nope!) \u00a0Taste-wise nothing to write home about, the bread is just so-so. \u00a0Marmalade added a nice kick to it though.Migas & Pulled Pork Eggs benedict - both were not too bad each came with a small side of their house potatoes. \u00a0The deep fried house potatoes were delish. Portions of the main entree were enough, but the side potatoes was on the lighter side, almost too little. \u00a0Service at 1:30 pm on a Sunday was a little slow - the place was fairly filled up, still, it seemed like they had a good number of servers, so this was a little disappointing. \u00a0Nice ambient, but can get very noisy. \u00a0Our overall rating of the restaurant is 2-star.", 
      "did lunch in their new tapas bar today. \u00a0had to sit at a bar table with those dreadful high chairs because there were no booths available. i'm not a big fan of being uncomfortable...ever.our waiter was great, in fact he added to my experience. \u00a0the interior is very well done for that particular genre.the food, eh, nothing to write home about. \u00a0had a small salad with the standard blue cheese, grapes, apples, walnuts=better than average. \u00a0then shared a few tapas with my friend. \u00a0we had the pita triangles with hummus and the tuna salad sandwich. \u00a0the portions were acurately small. \u00a0flavor was good but again, nothing special. \u00a0it was extremely cheap though...in addition to the food above we had the blackberry iced tea and 2 coffees and each spent $12 including tip.", 
      "Good atmosphere but the food is overpriced and midiocre. \u00a0I had a collection of appetizers at the bar that were not large enough portions. \u00a0We were ignored by the bartender for quite a long time as well; and the place was almost empty."

Their seafood is nice and fresh and the chocolate molten is a good finish for the meal. \u00a0I like the vibe in the restaurant and the outdoor seating is a plus to the the restaurant", 
      "Great vegetarian options and large beer selection! Highly recommend! Heard there was salsa dancing in the evening on Saturdays as well, but left before it started.", 
      "Got there about noon on a Saturday and was disappointed that they had limited brunch menu since I was looking forward to the highly rated tapas. \u00a0The server was very friendly and patient while we tried to figure out what to eat. \u00a0Ordered a bunch of food and drinks. \u00a0None of it was outstanding, but the attitude was so good that I would be willing to try again at tapas time. \u00a0Good attitude triumphs mediocre food.", 
      "A great lunch and brunch place, but I'm less impressed by their dinner fare.I mostly go here for brunch and the food rarely disappoints. The torta Maria and smoked port torta are unusual and always good. Each week the brunch specials usually include a special omelette, scrambler, and a sandwich. The omelettes are only OK; somehow they seem a bit dry and overcooked.My main complaint with brunch is the coffee. For my past several visits it's been quite weak and it's hard to get a refill. At a weekend brunch, I do expect good, hot coffee and not to go 20 minutes with my cup empty.For dinner, I think Radio is trying to present itself as more upscale and trendy than it is. A few years ago, the menu had a much more pronounced Carribean/Cuban/South American flair to it, and I miss that. I'm sure everything on the menu is very well-prepared, but it all seems like dishes I can get at any number of places.For my last dinner experienced there, I had a tenderloin special. It consisted of two pieces of tenderloin, one correctly medium, one well-done; six gnocchi (I counted); and a scattering of green peas. I believe the sauce mentioned in the description was absent. We did have a large party, but we were sitting at an empty table for nearly an hour before our food was ready; no salads, no bread. I guess we were expected to order cocktails and appetizers. Everything was tasty and was artistically arranged on an appropriately-trendy rectangular plate, but the portions were quite small. I shouldn't leave a restaurant after a $30 entree feeling a bit peckish.I feel like Radio can't decide what it is. A fancy drink bar? A tapas bar? A haute cuisine restaurant? It does all those things fairly well, but none of them exceptionally.", 
      "Nice restaurant in downtown Champaign. \u00a0Has a really nice atmosphere. \u00a0Good selection of wines. \u00a0I really wanted to like this place but in the end, their food is just forgettable. \u00a0I had the lamb once and that was a bit rough, not tender. \u00a0Also tried the salmon (or some other fish) once, also a bit overcooked. \u00a0Dessert menu was very standard.", 
      "Service was a little slow but great food and an interesting atmosphere.", 
      "We usually sit at the bar and order up tapas and drinks. \u00a0The bartender never missed a \u00a0chance to mix us up a mean cocktail of his own creation. \u00a0The food is good and priced right. \u00a0The atmosphere is also wonderful, and very unique. \u00a0They also serve brunch, which is great!", 
      "It is sometimes a great spot, but it is not as consistent as it was a few years back.", 
      "As I waited over 15 minutes for the waitress to return with my initial drink order on a slow night, I hoped the tonic wasn't as flat and flavorless as the last time. It was. I ordered a Bell's HopSlam the next moment I saw the waitress, and it came only 5 minutes after I pained through the flat gin and tonic. When the tapas came 45 after my wife and I arrived, we enjoyed the mussel in miso broth special and bacon-wrapped rainbow trout with aoili. The Spanish tortilla was burnt. Luckily, the harissa helped cover up the carcinogens. Now, I wait for the waitress to return so I can ask for the bill and go to a bar with responsive service. At least it's beautiful outside.", 
      "Overpriced. I ordered steak. Nothing to write home about. Better, cheaper choices abound.",

      "Radio Maria is a great off campus place to go because it has a different atmosphere than other places on campus. The food is pretty good, but the tapas I was not impressed by. \u00a0They were missing alot of key tapas meals, and the waitress we had the last time we went was very ditzy. None of our drinks were refilled, and it took forever to order. \u00a0Will prolly go back and hope that it's a little better. I really did like the atmosphere, and the food has potential.", 
      "Food is solidly good but not brilliant compared to tapas places I've been in other towns. \u00a0That being said I enjoyed the food and definitely will come back - it's creative, fresh, and varied.Kind of weird to have two kitchens/two menus that aren't coordinated - they start with an apology for it.Wine and beer list is plenty long and varied - flavors for everyone. \u00a0Plus, Tuesday is 1/2 off wine by the glass night - how can you beat that?Specials were very tasty - Mahi-mahi in parchment, and a local organic heirloom tomato salad w/orange zest and balsamic - yummy!Outside tables are great on a warm summer evening.Service at times a bit slow although great service attitude and personality by our server - as with any restaurant it depends on the person you get and the night you go...Agree with 3+ stars.", 
      "The good: - the decor. It's cool on one side; wood-warm and artistic on the other.- the food, when it works.The bad: - the food, which mostly doesn't work. It's all over the map, fusing foods from every which corner. I like fusion menus just fine, but the trick with them is that the tastes have to get along with each other. Radio Maria's often behave like they've never met, never wanted to meet, and hate each other when they do meet. The result is tastes which stomp on each other in needlessly complicated food. - the service. I second whoever wrote that it's hipper-than-thou. Apparently, no one is cool enough to be in Radio Maria, much less get competent, friendly service. Just ask the wait staff - if you can get their attention. We couldn't.", 
      "My meal here was phenomenal. I got the Masa Boat Surprise. My wife got the fish tacos. The masa boat was nothing short of amazing. It looks beautiful before you start eating, at which time it turns into chaos. You eat your way down to the little masa boat that is stuffed with Mexican cheeses. A really thin omelet tops the boat, and it was so loaded with veggies and chorizo that you hardly notice that the eggs are there. That is perfect omelet in my opinion. The dish also included black beans, yummy potatoes, and salsa. All for only $8. My wife's fish tacos were great too, but not as good as we've had in other locales.", 
      "Always a good place to go with friends/family from out of town for it's vegetarian friendly menu.",

      "Stunning!Astounding interior!Amazing Bar!Look at the bar - the rail is a retired escalator handrail. \u00a0Look above the bar, and you can see the shroud from a vane axial fan - a big one, from the former University of Illinois wind tunnel. \u00a0Even the host station is a re-purposed tube radio. \u00a0The center of the bar is a drink dispenser, made from a re-purposed laser. \u00a0Gad - there was so much eye-candy, I had a blast!The tapas is simply amazing - every dish we ordered was good. \u00a0The prices were on par for what you pay in downtown Champaign, and my daughter was smart enough to get us reservations. \u00a0If you're bold enough to try a walk in, all I can say is good luck. \u00a0They are reserved to the hilt usually.All in all, a good meal. \u00a0We have eaten here twice, and love the place.", 
      "This place is honestly a world class Spanish food/Tapas place. \u00a0The service is always awesome and they have a constantly changing menu that always includes things like cheese plates, steaks, fish, frog legs, with their goat cheese boursin stuff in lots of things. \u00a0Another reason going there is their great bar that has a beer selection which will please anyone who is as geeky about american craft beer as I am :-)", 
      "Awesome decor - heard that the owner customized everything himself.The food was very good, not amazing but definitely among the better culinary experiences available in the Urbana-Champaign area. \u00a0One caveat is that the portions are rather small.",

      "Sunday brunch is the best in town, in my opinion. \u00a0Portions are generous and the entrees are flavorful and hearty. \u00a0Options for vegetarians. \u00a0Evening tapas is good, but Radio Maria's brunch is what won me over -- and very reasonably priced -- about $10 including coffee.", 
      "Came here for my birthday. Was greeted at the door by the host and led into the dining room that was dimly lit by candlelight. We ordered a couple glasses of pinot noir and were happy with their selection. Our appetizer, the broiled goat cheese, was amazing. The grilled bread provided great texture to the meaty pumpkin seed and spice spread and the divine creaminess of the goat cheese. Our entrees were the two dinner specials for the evening, seared diver scallops and a filet. Our scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The accompanying puree had pieces of bacon which perfectly complemented the entire dish. Our filet was a beautiful medium-rare piece of meat that just melted in my mouth. The bourbon demi glace and gratin brought the dish together into a very enjoyable experience. We tried two desserts, the molten chocolate cake and the green tea white chocolate mousse. I absolutely loved the mousse while my partner preferred the chocolate cake. The best part of the rich chocolate cake was the fresh mint ice cream that came with it. Overall it was an amazing dinner. Go to Radio Maria and order their dinner specials. You will not be disappointed.", 
      "The ambience at the bar is really exceptional. \u00a0We always sit at the bar for tapas.. You must be in an experimental mood, this food is nowhere near \"normal bar food\". \u00a0The sea scallops and the seared tuna will make you crave more. \u00a0The bartender can accomodate any request, with a passion. \u00a0We have him making key lime pie martinis, and they rock. \u00a0 Fun place. Ultra Cool. Super Hip.", 
      "We wanted an interesting overnight stop enroute to our Northern Michigan vacation & figured a mega-university town on summer break could fill the bill.It was perfect place to spend the evening, despite no TV to see opening ceremony of Olympic Games.",

      "I love this place. \u00a0My friends and I try to have a 'girl's night out' once a month and we frequent Radio Maria because of the delicious cuisine and the atmosphere. \u00a0It is relaxing and has several conversation pieces. \u00a0The service is spectacular. \u00a0This is one of my favorite local spots to dine in Champaign", 
      "I've moved back to Champaign-Urbana after living here briefly 8 years ago and sooo much has changed. I feel like either the town finally realized that it would be wise to start spiffing its image up a bit to attract more students' $$ \u00a0by spending some $$ or else maybe in the last 8 years, CU's been adopted by a millionaire benefactor with desire to see a small town emulate a big bad city in its gastric offerings. The restaurant scene here has improved phenomenally. My boyfriend and I popped into Radio Maria after being turned away from Bacaro for not having a reservation on a Saturday night. We both had to giggle a little as that's never happened to either of us before in Chicago but it's good to get rejected every now and then. The waitress was apologetic and nice enough about it. So next door to Radio it was and I'm so glad we gave it a chance. We hadn't been in the mood for tapas until we opened the menu. Surprisingly innovative, interesting and very hip. We tried the smoked red potatoes with aioli, the fire roasted pears with manchego shavings and fennel, spanish fusilli pasta salad with olives (which I didn't want to fuss with at first b/c I hate spitting out seeds in public but they were pitted, nice touch) and spanish olive oil. I'm not a big dessert person but since I'd been enjoying the meal so much, I splurged and ordered the pumpkin cheesecake with cinnamon cream sauce. Still thinking about it a day later...the restaurant's decor was again surprisingly hip for Champaign. The bar is lit in blue from beneath and the artwork was very urban/Japanese. There was this cool light box banner thing running the length of the artfully splash-painted brick walls that I'd love to have in our house back in Chicago. Check it out if you're in town. The waitstaff and service was also very friendly, young and attentive.", 
      "I'm a huge fan of Radio Maria, but their Valentine's Day Dinner left a very bad taste in my mouth and it wasn't the food. \u00a0Radio Maria is my favorite restaurant in Champaign. \u00a0The food is top-notch and the atmosphere is one of a kind. \u00a0But my wife and I had their Valentine's day menu this past weekend. \u00a0The food was great, but not for the outrageous cost. \u00a0It was $50/person plus drinks for a \"tasting\" menu that wouldn't have filled up a mouse. \u00a0Normally the value/price ratio is excellent. \u00a0I always felt like the food was worth the cost, but not the valentine's day fixed menu. \u00a0The high price combined with lack luster service took the sizzle out of what could have been a hot night.", 
      "This place is a paradox. I was there over Memorial Day weekend, on Saturday night, and had none of the issues with staff \"coolness\" that others reported. We were treated well and served professionally as we stayed all evening (7-11 PM). The drinks were good, though I'd say the beer was a bit small for the otherwise fair price. The odd thing is that the food is irrationally high priced - at least for the entrees. Our group of 4 ordered 3 of the specials and 1 menu item. The specials (which are not priced on the board) were simple plates of an entree & a \"decorative\" side. I ordered the Paella from the menu. The Paella was a 6 inch skillet of rice and seafood - 3 or so pieces each of shrimp and scallops, with some hard cooked sausage slices throughout. Good, but not special. Two of the specials were a fillet with a garlic crust - 4 oz of good meat. So what's the issue? Well $30 for the fillet and $24 for the Paella is an outrage for a remodeled VFW in a College town. This pricing is just too much like Soho/Manhattan - but it is Central Illinois! So go for the drinks and the Salsa Dancing after 10:30, but skip the food - it just is not worth it.", 
      "I just finished dinner here about an hour ago, and I'm still wondering how Radio Maria managed to get all of this attention. \u00a0I guess their HUGE wine/beer/drink list was pretty impressive, but the food...was not. \u00a0My first disappointment was in the size of the menu. \u00a0I looked it up online and they seemed to have a wide array of choices, when I saw the actual menu, I think there were 5 entree choices, in addition to a wide variety of tapas. \u00a0On top of that, the one dish I wanted, was sold out, so I went with the Smoked Duck and Brie Pizza. \u00a0I mean, it was OK, there was a good amount of duck on the pizza but the whole time I was craving more brie!! \u00a0They could have seriously doubled the amount of brie on the pizza and it still might not have been enough, I could hardly taste it. \u00a0Also, it wasn't really a pizza at all, more like a cold flatbread, so be forewarned. \u00a0I also ordered a small side salad. \u00a0It was a delicious spinach salad, but lived up to the \"small\" definition....AND it was $6--give me a break. \u00a0If I'm looking to drink, maybe I'll stop by next time I'm in town, but I'll hit up K.O. Fusion or Jim Gould over this place ANY day!", 
      "Radio Maria was one of the first restaurants in the current resurgence of downtown. \u00a0When it opened around 1996, two upscale restaurants had come and gone in the Mike n' Molly's space, and other than Great Impasta, in its old location, there was nary a place to eat downtown except in bars/ short-order cafes. \u00a0RM made quite a splash, and I thought it pretty good the first several years. \u00a0Nice space, creative menu (for CU), \u00a0and some good servers. \u00a0Then things starting going south as more and more better-quality eating places opened downtown and elsewhere. \u00a0I feel they often try too hard with their entrees...too many conflicting influences and tastes. \u00a0I am all for fusion cuisine done well, but I think they lose the forest for the trees here a lot. \u00a0Now, the new tapas bar I like quite a bit. \u00a0Very reasonable, GREAT beer list, better service, and b/c of the nature of tapas, a more focused concept and execution of cuisine. \u00a0Both spaces are nice - they are adjacent to each other.",

      "Wow, this place has really changed, now they occupy two spaces instead of one. One space is for formal dining, while the other is more casual and laid back. We sat across a huge purple bar. The menu was much different than I remembered. \u00a0Instead of entrees like half chickens with grilled plantains, etc. they offered Tapas, which we didn't mind at all. In fact, we love Tapas. The best Tapas we ordered was the vegetarian paella. I wished the paella was served on a big platter like in Spain, but it was just in a tiny side dish, which I understand is part of the whole Tapas mentality, but still I wished they'd offer it on the menu as a main dish. The margarita I ordered was spot on. Not to strong, not to watered down. And their prices are extremely reasonable. We spent $47.00 without tip for six tapas, two margaritas, and one dessert, which we shared. I still love Radio Maria's, but I like the decor on the older side better.", 
      "What a unique, wonderful place! \u00a0This place has 2 sides, each with their own menu: a tapas side and a restaurant side, I ate in the tapas side. \u00a0Must have = eggplant frites. \u00a0Their drink menu was extensive, but pricey. \u00a0The service was a little slow, but granted, it was a Saturday night. \u00a0The server was personable and ready to provide recommendations though. \u00a0The place itself is beautiful and modern, and they decorate with art from local artists. \u00a0I'd definitely go back when I visit Champaign.", 
      "Simply put, this is one of the best \"date places\" in Champaign. \u00a0The food is amazing and priced very well. \u00a0The bar is a blast and the staff is very friendly.", 
      "Unique place. \u00a0You won't find anything like it. \u00a0Has a full resturant and a apas bar. \u00a0Great food, and truly excellent service. \u00a0Easily the most interesting place in central Illinois. \u00a0Really."

      "Cool vibe here, nice beer garden, great selection. \u00a0They only had two of their own brews on tap during my visit, the IPA was sold out. \u00a0I had their ESB, it was ok, but the guest tap selection was excellent. \u00a0Great setting and relaxing. \u00a0I actually started at their bar about a block away because I didn't know about the brewery. \u00a0All guest taps there and great selection too. \u00a0If you're going to choose, go to the brewery, better setting.", 
      "Went on a Monday night and was really impressed by the specials. The bartender recommended a great beer and I got it for only $1.50! Really laid-back atmosphere, people are nice, kind of quiet (but I did go twice in the day time, so that could be why). Great bar, I'd definitely go back.", 
      "Best place to get a good variety of beer in town.The beer brewed in house can be hit or miss but I appreciate that kind of experimentation in a brew pub.I also always secretly wished they served food but if they did, I'd probably never leave!", 
      "Great draft beers, great prices, great atmosphere! Of note: This pub does not offer food.", 
      "The Atmosphere - 5 stars. I love hanging out at the Piglet, whether it be in the snug inside at one of the small wooden tables, or especially the fantastic patio in the alley out back. The ambience is great outdoors with strings of lights hanging and a small water fountain, and its a great place to come read or catch up with friends.The Guest Taps - 5 stars. Though only 12ish taps are available, I always find two or three beers that I can't wait to try, and the rotating nature of the taps keeps everything fresh!The Blind Pig Beer - 2 stars. I've just never been super impressed with what I've tasted of the beers made at the Piglet; some too thin, some too heavy, some with just a weird funk! Overall - 4 stars. I waffled between 4 or 5 here, my experiences being at the 5 level. But if my review is to encompass the whole place, and the Pig beer is part of that, and I just haven't fallen for it yet!", 
      "I don't have a visit to Champaign without a visit to the Blind Pig for trivia night. They have some pretty interesting things on tap (I regularly go with folks who home-brew and know what they are talking about). Trivia night is (I think) mostly Sundays and it's a ton of fun. No idea what their food is like, but when I've seen it served it looks pretty good. More of a bar than a restaurant, though. Great service and really fun atmosphere.", 
      "My girlfriend and I always stop in on Monday nights because they have $2 off all bottles. (beer) \u00a0That being said, we usually have about 4 or 6 beers in total for around $10. A great deal! \u00a0We each have about 3 beers and end up only paying around $10 total. As of this past Monday, we will not be patronizing the Blind Pig any longer. The bartender told us they were completely out of the Weach, which is my favorite. I then ask for the apricot, which they are out of as well...keep in mind, both of these beers run about $1.50 each on Monday nights with the discount. \u00a0He then offers up a raspberry beer that he promises will be comparable to the fruit beers that they were out of. \u00a0However, the bartender forgets to mention that the beer he suggested, which I've never heard of before was $25 per bottle!!! \u00a0 \u00a0How deceptive and shady! \u00a0I am clearly a regular there on Monday nights due to the cheap bottle beer...shouldn't you give the customer a \"heads up\" that the beer you just suggested to them was $25 a bottle? \u00a0Shady and very deceptive. \u00a0I ended up ordering his suggestion, which I hated and later found out it was $25 a bottle when I went to close my tab. Buyer beware!!!", 
      "One of my all time favorite breweries. \u00a0If you like the original Blind Pig, then you will no doubt love this place. It looks the same, and has the same wood work as the original. With an old barn look and lots of dark wood. The wood is taken from a 200 year old barn and antique tables. A relatively small and centrally located bar in front of the taps, the bar back is over 150 years old as well. The area has a couple of tables out front, and a great beer garden out back. Character oozes out of every wood poor here. Really laid back and relaxing. The service is good. The bar tenders know their stuff, and are usually quick. \u00a0Sometimes it takes a little to get noticed.The house beers are great. Usually 3-4. There was a Winter Warmer, a Belgian Dark, and an IPA the first time I visited. The house beers are constantly rotating, and they are always something interesting and unique (A Peach Wit, Dry Hopped Pale, Cherry Stout, Barleywines). They also have about 15 taps of other good micros and imports that rotates regularly as well. There is always something different to try. There are a ton of bottles as well. The quality is always exceptional, just fresh as can be.You can't beat a quality brewpub, and this one is excellent. Very fresh and always enjoyable. It is about time there was a good brewpub in Champaign. Really, one of my favorite brewpubs I have been to. I can't recommend this place enough.", 
      "I don't drink beer.I know.I enjoy a good hard cider, or a mixed drink, or perhaps a frou-frou now and again. I was excited to see that The Blind Pig is brewing their own cider, but bummed that it isn't being sold yet. I (tried) to settle for Woodchuck Amber, but they were out--must have been popular, cause the guy two stools down had one, and the girl after me asked for one! I then had to double settle for the Woodchuck Pear, which actually ended up better than I remember. It was crazy, back to back(or worse, front to front) packed, so we retreated to the patio, which is lovely. Thank goodness it was actually a decent night for November!", 
      "First of all- this place has two beers from Stone Brewing Co,.......ON TAP.I take it that Champaign is a drinkin' town, but this is a phenomena universally considered as kick-@ss anywhere within the known galaxy.Also- the 'Pig is gritty, dark, and distressed inside, as any good watering hole should be. But like it's booze selection- is not without a bit of distinction. It's a labrynth of cathedral arches and dark recesses. The only thing missing is a dirt floor. It's crazy like that.", 
      "Delicious beers (and cider!) My first experience here was after the reception of two of my friends' wedding in 2010. It's a staple of C-U. I've always liked it because of the low-key, relaxed atmosphere (most of the time). It's a great reprieve from the usual under-21 rowdy crowds on Green street.A good place to relax with old friends with a tasty brew.", 
      "The home-brewed beers first became available this week and we enjoyed 4 on the first day. \u00a0But by Thursday and again on Friday they only had two home brewed, one of which was the cider. \u00a0So, a little disappointing that they ran out of home brewed so soon after they first became available. \u00a0That having been said, the decor is nice and feels warm, and the sound is muffled enough that you can have a conversation without resorting to shouting.The beer selection is good. \u00a0The wine offerings on the other hand are proudly displayed to be \"Black Box\" box wines, which I have never seen in any bar...Its not that box wine is bad, it just was so strange.My last complaint, and this probably cost them a star is that they offer almost nothing to eat. \u00a0Planters peanuts in a pouch and tiny sample bags of pretzels are the total menu. \u00a0Maybe one or two other non-perishable bar snacks would keep folks from feeling the need to leave to get dinner.Can someone get this bar a Slim Jim or a pink hard boiled egg?", 
      "The Blind Pig recently opened a second location, one street across on Neil St, providing downtown Champaign with another bar stocked with good beer.The real draw here will be the house-brewed beer - in the coming months, there will be four drafts of craft brewed Blind Pig brand beers. \u00a0Until then, the draft selection is a (smaller) reflection of the selection from the Blind Pig around the corner. \u00a0Despite that, the new Pig Brewery remains very busy, both in the small interior and the very large beergarden.", 
      "I love the Brewery (Piglet?). \u00a0It has become my new go-to bar for when I want to have good beer, overtaking its older brother in my esteem. \u00a0While the Pig is now crowded and full of people asking for Busch Lite, the Brewery is comfortable and usually has available seating.During the summer, this place can't be beat: a huge amount of comfortable outdoor seating, and excellent service always. \u00a0In addition, their beers are generally good, with a few (I remember a certain honey cider with \"50 pounds of honey\") being FANTASTIC. \u00a0Mug night is also a deal, and you won't get quality at that price ($2 off each beer) anywhere else.", 
      "Long story short: if you are going to label yourself a 'brewery' and offer a really good selection of beer (they do), then OWN it. \u00a0My guess is that the owner/manager/shot caller knows and loves their beer (me too!). \u00a0However, I think that \u00a0If he/she went into his/her own bar as a paying customer, they'd find their staff cannot execute on that vision at all. \u00a0I won't go into the details, but their staff treated me like a transient when I asked to \"taste\" one of the beers on tap. \u00a0I was first taken aback (it was like the guy had never heard of that), then insulted, then embarrassed...for him! \u00a0He pretty much refused me and it wasn't like I wasn't spending money. \u00a0It wasn't like I was sitting there ordering Busch Lite all night and then suddenly wanted just a little freebie of the good stuff for chrissake! \u00a0Still, they have good beer, the concept is great and the atmosphere (kind of low-key dive-ish) is good, so despite the staff; 3 stars.", 
      "The Blind Pig Brewery has become my favorite bar since moving back to Champaign from Ann Arbor. I like it a bit better than the original Blind Pig because it's a long, narrow space. This can work against it because it fills up easy, and it's not conducive to a group bigger than four people until the patio opens up. Still though, I like feeling cozy with my fellow bargoers. The decor and atmosphere are great. The beer list is good too; mostly bottles. It's the place to go to support your Michigan breweries! If only they'd order some Shorts. Their own craft brews have generally been okay, but supply does seem to run out quickly. This isn't really an issue for me since there's plenty of other beers on the menu I've never tried, but if you're coming specifically to try some local beer you might go home disappointed.The one other knock is that it can be hard to get served when it's busy (just like 90% of other bard, I suppose). The narrow physical space of the bar means that traversing it is difficult when there's more than a couple people waiting to order.All in all, though, definitely worth the modest prices. Great place to either sit inside or out back with the beautiful City Building in view.", 
      "I like \"The Piglet\" well enough but I really think downtown Champaign needs another bar like it needs another grad student sitting outside a coffee shop writing a thesis on their Macbook that is going to change the world. \u00a0I've heard the rumor that The Piglet was built to hold the overflow from The Big Pig and I'm interested to see how the business holds up once the crowds who were enjoying the unusually beautiful and humidity free evenings this summer disappear into their holes for the winter. \u00a0The interior is cozy and dark but I don't think it will be able to hold crowds in the winter months. \u00a0On the plus side...they have $1.75 Old Style Drafts (rock on!), the beer garden really is monstrous and a nice place to hang out, and I've never had bad service from the staff. \u00a0Keep it up Piglet...I'll be back to see you next time I'm in town!", 
      "The Piglet is my go-to bar. It has great ambiance and provides an intimate bar setting with no frills or distractions other than a great selection. The best and worst part about this place is its narrow corridor shape and limited tables, small and narrow, intimate and personal and yet tends to get crowded and impenetrable during prime weekend hours.They have seasonal micro-brews that cater to most palates. I recommend the Wietbier and Hard Cider, both out during the spring and summer season. They also have a wide mix of bottles and ever-changing draft selection, along with the four or five micro-brews to go along with the full bar. There prices are reasonable for the area. The micro-brews typically run between four to six dollars. The only downside to the menu is the complete lack of food: no appetizers or peanuts here.This is a simple but fun bar and is especially good for afternoon get-togethers or cocktail hours in the early weekday afternoons. Something is always on special. Because they are in downtown Champaign, the management keeps a close eye on the clientele to be sure no underclassmen filter through. This is also a great place to start an evening on the town, too.", 
      "There are two kinds of bars: ones that serve food in order to compensate for the lower quality of their beer and ones whose beer is so damned amazing that food is something you should've thought of beforehand. The Blind Pig Brewery is definitely of the latter type. There are 3 distinctions between the Brewery, which my friends and I refer to as \"the Piglet\" in reference to its smaller size and the original Blind Pig: 1. The wide availability of outdoor seating makes the Brewery better than the Pig for people who enjoy fresh air over enclosed caverns of noisy stuffiness. 2. Beer Club Mondays have a $1 off bottled beers which allows others to experience an incredibly wide array of European and specialized microbrews. Also its fun to attempt to conquer the long list of beers. 3. Trivia on Sundays. I love beer and places like the Brewery and the original Blind Pig convinced me that my move to Champaign for education hadn't abandoned my tastebuds completely. If like good foodstuffs, this place is one that won't disappoint you at all.", 
      "The Blind Pig - and now their brewery - are really probably the only places you should go to if you're an adult (or grad student) and find yourself at UIUC. I've been impressed with downtown Champaign on a couple of recent visits and glad to see it growing.This nano-brewer's output is small enough that they don't yet offer growlers to go. Bit of a bummer, but understandable. I got a sampler with 3 of their beers - good sized pours (see the pic) and cheap too. Nice breadth of styles and flavors. This isn't going to be the next [insertcurrentlytrendybrewer] but then again, I don't think that's the goal. I get the feeling they want to make good beer, local beer, something that satisfies and share it at a price we all can afford. They've exceeded at each of those. Head out on a nice night and hang out in the beer garden and if I'm lucky enough, I'll see you there.", 
      "The Piglet is a nice little bar in downtown Champaign. While the indoor part of the bar is very crowded (and there are places that are just as dark as it's big brother on Walnut), the outdoor garden is quite fantastic. Plus, I'm a big fan of all the brewing equipment in the windows. Otherwise, there's not much to set the Piglet apart from the main brewery. The beer list is okay, but not otherworldly, and the spirits are also pretty limited. A good place if you're into beer, and if it's summertime.", 
      "Very few brews of their own. The night we were there they had one bartender, way too long to wait for a pint. I'm sure it's a favorite of college students, and I can relate because that is their market, but for me it just didn't work.", 
      "The beer is decent. \u00a0My favorite was Rhubarb Wheat.", 
      "I really like this place. The bartender was really friendly and since it wasn't too busy when i was in took the time to talk to me about different stuff to do in Champaign since i had just moved here. I really appreciated that!When I went in there was only one microbrew left of the four (I think there are four) but it was actually really good. I was disappointed that I couldn't try any of the others, though. It seems like they need to readjust their brewing schedule/amount or something because it seems like they're running out of their brews really fast!Next time I go I'm going to check out the outdoor patio area because it looks so lovely and perfect for a nice summer's evening.", 
      "I've been here twice now, and my only complaint is the size of the tables in the booths, but whatever, I'm just being persnickety. \u00a0The bartenders are quite knowledgeable and will allow you to taste what they have on tap. The local brews are very tasty, quite strong (as all true beers are), and inexpensive. There's trivia (w/ deals on Jameson & Guinness) on Sundays, a beer club on Mondays, and probably other fun stuff throughout the week, too.A beer garden/patio is situated out back. Once the weather gets warmer, I'm totally plopping my rear, a pint, and a book out there on a Saturday afternoon.", 
      "I love this place!They always have freshly brewed beer on tap, and if you are in the mood for something else, just get a bottle of something, there is a huge list of bottled beer.I have never had any problems with the bartenders, they are always quick and courteous.The only problem you might ever have here is finding a seat. \u00a0It is so popular that they sometimes fill up all of the inside and outside (even when it is freezing outside).", 
      "There really isn't much to say to great beer and a decerning \u00a0crowd. The beer is a constant conversation piece among all the patrons. Usually 4 or 5 home brewed samples which change on a regular basis. The home brews tangs across the whole gambit of craft brews. The place has no food and no gaming and no entertainment and no scantly clad bartenders although the ladies seem to be here the men out number the ladies. A great place to drink beer and talk about beer. Not a college hangout.", 
      "So The Piglet finally revealed their micro-brews a few weeks ago. \u00a0Well, i was working for the grand reveal and missed on most of the brews as they were sold out by my next brew-focused quest downtown. I did happen to get a pint of their bitter... which i promptly gagged at. It had the distinct taste of a bacterial infection (some bacteria is needed in a good bitter, mind you) and it was simply overpowering. I understand that, in order for it to be the Blind Pig BREWERY, said bar has to have some micro-brews, but I wouldn't supply my customers with poor product just to make up for batches of mistakes and wasted supplies. It's called integrity, my friends. Poor business ethics, poor beer.Unnecessary addendum: \u00a0I don't understand the boxed wine thing... Must do some gumshoe work on this...", 
      "For years, I would see Champaign on the map and would always say \"I should go there at some point.\" A number of my favorite bands are originally from Champaign, and I've known a number of U of I graduates over the years. I finally did a year or so ago right after we moved to Indiana. I was just looking for a day trip and it seemed like a good idea. I hit the Blind Pig when it opened on that Tuesday because they were listed on a site as brewing their own draft beer. Since then, I've come out to Champaign twice more and will be back again, and the Blind Pig has a lot to do with that. This is a great beer bar. In fact, it's become one of my top ten beer bars in the country.One thing that makes it a great beer bar is a great draft list that the staff really gets behind and knows a lot about. It changes regularly, but it's always really interesting and from various places around the country. Last time I was in there, they had a Two Brothers, a Left Hand, a Schlafly and a Stone, and I don't believe I had had any of the particular varieties, even though I'm a regular drinker of all those breweries. They also do their own beer. Sure, it's hit or miss, but they're trying. And you get some really good stuff sometimes. Downside, as mentioned, is that it's really small batch, so you're lucky to find the same house beer on tap for two consecutive weeks. They do reuse recipes though so it may come back.What I really like about the Pig is the vibe. This is very much a locals place. In fact, the first time I heard the word \"townie\" used non-sarcastically was by a bartender here (it's more of a Midwestern thing, I guess, because I've heard it several times since). But it's a local beer snob place. The regulars here are a little old and drunkenly, but they really care about their beer, which is why they come back. I've always met interesting people here when I've come.But the main reason I come back: mug club. For $5 you can buy a Blind Pig mug, which you can choose to leave there or take home. And that mug gets you $2 off all drafts on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. As a result, I've always gotten out of there well toasted for under $20.The interior has old college town bar written all over it (although it's certainly not an undergrad sort of place), and it has a very nice patio in the back. They tend to have good music, but it's at the bartender's whim, so it varies. No food. I've seen it brought in, but I wouldn't try to bring it in myself.I should add, also, that, although I'm not really a liquor drinker, they seem to have a very good liquor selection. This is one of the few places I've seen Johnny Walker Blue Label.", 
      "The first and foremost thing I expect from a place that calls itself a brewery is a broad selection of beer brewed on premises. Sadly, not only is the selection small-- at most four choices, more often only 2 or 3-- but the quality rarely gets above mediocre. More often than not there's at least one beer or cider at any time that is objectively flawed-- murky, smelly, unintentionally sour.The atmosphere is rather dark, dingy, and claustrophobic, consisting of basically one narrow shot through the building. When the place fills up-- and it doesn't take much-- it can be difficult to shoulder past the people standing at the bar.Saving graces are a modest and decent bottle selection as well as several guest taps, and the presence of a nice-sized outdoor seating section that's good for the 7 or 8 months a year it's not too cold, snowy, or rainy outside.Bottom line is that I've been giving this place a chance since shortly after it opened, but sadly it hasn't seemed to come around to be the kind of place that's inviting enough for me to frequent.(From reading other reviews I should also point out that more than a few people are getting the Blind Pig Brewery confused with The Blind Pig Pub. Though owned by the same people they're different places.)", 
      "Great atmosphere and brews! We go most Tuesdays and/or Wednesdays for mug night - which is a great deal for the only brewery in town! The only disappointment is the lack of any type of bar snack for sale... however, you can bring in outside food which is fortunate (but a little bit of a pain when you just want a snack).", 
      "Very friendly, but doesn't have as much character as the Pig. \u00a0I tried two of the in-house beers, the Cherry Milk Stout (delicious) and the Red Rye Ale (disgusting).", 
      "It's a little more cramped and crowded than other bars in the area, but since my friends and I scored a tallboy table and our access to the bartender was substantially unhindered, The Pig is all good in my book.", 
      "The Piglet is a nice intimate bar with a great bar and some amazing craft brews. Although it can get very crowded the clientele is grad student and late 20's so no worries about loud drunks. A great place to go when you just want to unwind and relax.", 
      "Solid place. \u00a0Good beer selection and a small brewery allows for some in-house beers that aren't bad on their own. \u00a0I'll stop by next time i'm in town.", 
      "I'm a pretty picky person and not really a beer connoisseur so I don't usually like to try different kinds and just stick to my bud light. My friend and I happened in here one night when our usual bar was WAY to loud (stupid salsa night). The bartender let me try several of the on tap beers and I found one I liked. We LOVED the atmosphere and the music was fantastic. We started to frequent this bar every week and have never had a bad experience and I am now on my way to trying new beers. I also enjoy that they change the draft beers often. Mug night (Tue, Wed) is defiantly a night to visit.", 
      "I had a really great time on the \"mug night\" that I visited a few times. This place has a great outdoor area where I could spend hours. Great selection, a chill crowd later in the night, and very friendly bartenders. Would definitely return if in the area again.", 
      "It felt like a tavern crossed with a kitschy antique store in here, but maybe that's just me. \u00a0I really appreciated that they played music at a level that can coexist with conversation at your table. Great tap selection and decent prices. \u00a0It was busy but not packed on the Friday night of our visit, and the setup was just right to play some cards at one of their barside tables.", 
      "I'll probably up my rating once the Piglet starts serving their own beers, 'cause god knows I love local microbrews. \u00a0But for now it's just alright. \u00a0It is a smaller version of the Blind Pig with a poor layout and a way toned down beer selection. \u00a0I hope it'll get better with the introduction of their own beers, but if not, I still have its mother ship, so all is well.", 
      "Beer is ok. Like the outdoor seating. But I prefer the Original Pig."

      "Decent burgers but for the price you can get better in town. \u00a0The best reason to come here though is the cheese fries. Their cheese sauce is uhhh-mazing! \u00a0The staff is always very friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming and clean. \u00a0We eat here from time to time but since it ends up running about 30 bucks for two people we go here sparingly (or when we crave those cheese fries!!)I love that they give you sea salt grinders amd pepper grinders insteaf of the ol stuff we are all used to. \u00a0Nice touch.",

The food was excellent btw. Excellent burger and fries.",

      "Our favorite burger place in Champaign. Great burger and fries. My favorite combination is Hawaiian burger with cajun fries. The fries portion is quite big, which could be enough for two. Beside the food, what makes us keep coming back to this place is its staffs - very friendly with smiles always on their face. Highly recommend when coming to Champaign!", 
      "Love the food, love the service. These guys are great! Definitely try the cajun fries.", 
      "Just finished a wonderful salad called \"the chopped wedge.\" Ordered it as listed on the menu board but added the \u00a0crispy chicken. The iceberg lettuce was cold and crisp. I asked my husband when he had ever seen me eat a salad without dressing. Answer was \"never.\" That' s how great this salad was. Have to add the blue cheese vinaigrette was very good ... I dipped my chicken in it! Great staff every time we go.", 
      "We have been to Meatheads in both Champaign and Bloomington. Both times it was delicious! The burgers beat the heck out of Five Guys, and the fries do too! Especially the cajun fries! And you MUST try the cheese sauce for dipping...yummy and a little spicy. The milk shakes are for real, too. Great, now I'm hungry...", 
      "Surprisingly a not so great place for meatheads to eat. Food is really greasy. That's probably the main ingredient, grease. They drown everything in fats and their cajun spices to mask the mediocrity of their other ingredients. I would not recommend this place but it's not inedible.", 
      "This place's burgers remind me of Five Guy's with more options. I'm impressed with many of their burgers, and my kids have enjoyed the chicken, too. I'd put their fries up against anyone's. The only restaurant that has better fries anywhere is Arthur Bryant's in Kansas City. I'm as pleased as I can be that they have a reading incentive program for kids. My kids are actually doing this and enjoying it. As others have mentioned, the freestyle drink machines are great. So what's not to like?!Did I mention my 5 year old likes to call them \"Beefheads\"? That's worth the trip by itself!", 
      "If you are looking for a genuine American cheeseburger this is the best place to go in Champaign. All in all the resteraunt featuring a coke freestyle machine has an atmosphere that makes you want to come back.", 
      "Tried quite a few burgers in town during my first year here. Meatheads has become my burger of choice. The staff is incredibly friendly, the food arrives fast, and you can build your own delicious burger. So stop eating crap burgers from McDonald's/Burger King/Wendy's and other cheap fast food joints. Upgrade to Meatheads!", 
      "As an update re: my last review, I was contacted by regional management and was asked very nicely for specifics about why our experience was unsatisfactory. \u00a0After voicing my complaints, I was offered a generous gift card ($25) for my feedback, which was not necessary but we appreciated it. \u00a0We've already used it, and the service experience seemed better this time. \u00a0While it's still a bit steep price-wise, I do like the burgers and it's comparable to several other fast-food places in town.Just want them to get the credit they deserve for following up so quickly to my relatively unknown Yelp posting to make things right.", 
      "Man, this burger will haunt my dreams. We came across this place while we were in town for friend's wedding and we could not have been more impressed. I loved the warm, friendly staff and the fast arrival of our food. To top that, I loved the juicy burgers and chicken tenders (probably the best I've ever had - seriously!). It really hit the spot for dinner. My only wish is that you would expand out and create a location in California! Love this place and highly recommend!", 
      "When I first arrived, the line was out the door which I thought was both a good sign about the food and a sign that this might take a while. But the cashiers were speedy and maybe the customers were decisive as well. The concept of this place is similar to that of Chipotle--you pick what toppings you want on your burger or you can choose one of their predefined burgers. \u00a0I went with the second option and ordered the californian with regular fries and a drink which came to a total of just under $12. \u00a0Kind of a lot for a meal at a fast-food like place but I was hungry so whatever. My meal was pretty good and there was a ton of fries in the \"regular\" portion. \u00a0They were thin and crispy as well which I loved. \u00a0The burger itself was good, it did fall apart a little bit when I tried to eat it, but there were a good amount of toppings so that was predictable. \u00a0I was disappointed in the amount of cucumber wasabi on my burger as I was really looking forward to that. \u00a0I feel like I only tasted it in one bite. \u00a0Instead I just added some of the specialty spicy chipotle kethcup available which was delicious and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like ketchup and eats her fries dry. \u00a0They also have Coca-Cola freestyle machines were you can pretty much have any Coke drink imaginable so that's cool. It also means the person in line behind me gets irritated because I like to check out all of my options before making a decision.", 
      "All great experiences at Meatheads! The burgers are great, and their fries are the perfect combo to go with the burger. Try the cajun fries if you like a little extra kick! The restaurant was very clean and the service was also excellent. The food came so quickly and they clean up for you right away when you are finished.", 
      "The only fast food choice you should even consider in Champaign. Nearly leaps into sit-down restaurant status. Quality ingredients and a wide variety of choices make this a destination heads and shoulders above the rest. The staff is always friendly and very helpful. \u00a0John was a welcome smile for my late night drive-through purchase. He encouraged me to come back to try the milkshakes. I definitely will include that stop on my next Champaign trip.", 
      "We ate at Meatheads on June 14th 2014, everything was fabulous. \u00a0 The service was excellent, \u00a0the manager is fabulous and my burger was amazing. \u00a0 Hands down ten times better than 5 Guys! \u00a0 \u00a0We will definitely be back....", 
      "Awesome food and service. I get the Cajun Sunrise burger most of the time! Also, order kid sized fries because regular may be a little too much for most people. The serving is still a lot for \"kid-sized\"However, it seems they get new people staffed every so often which slows down the speed of my order because they are training. But everyone else working there is so nice and friendly!All in all, I really love this joint!! I frequent it and leave satisfied every time.", 
      "I stopped by Meatheads one weekend and while I had fun, I wasn't blown away. \u00a0I ordered a cajun, which was a solid meal for one. \u00a0The burger came with egg + fresh jalepenos (delish) + cheese, etc. hold the bleu cheese sauce. \u00a0Everything was nicely spiced and season, but the egg was a little overcooked and the patties were on the dry side. \u00a0For ~$7/person, my sister and I had a solid OK meal.", 
      "I don't go for fancy dancy burgers, like wasabi or fried egg and weird flavors. But if you like that, they have it at Meatheads. \u00a0There are tons of choices to put atop your burger.All fresh. It's an adult \u00a0fast food atmosphere. \u00a0I like the regular old cheese burger, so I got a 1/3 lb. burger, which is two thin \u00a0 patties. All in all, it was tasty, it was almost everything I wanted in a hamburger. \u00a0Fresh ingredients. \u00a0The patties are fresh, never frozen, as per the manager. \u00a0It was very tasty and our order came out fast, and the staff was friendly, the place is clean. The fries are really good. \u00a0Crispy, thin (but not too thin) and salty!!!I'd go here again for a quick burger. UPDATE: I had a nice email from the manager, I would patronize this place again because it appears he CARES!!!", 
      "Very friendly staff, but the service was a little slow. \u00a0Those burgers, Cajun fries and shakes are amazing. \u00a0Lots of great choices for beverages and toppings.", 
      "I love this place. It's a bit provide than the average fast food burger joint, but the food is so much better. I'd argue that the food is better tasting than most sit-down burger places in C-U. Perhaps more importantly to someone as dorky as I am is that they regularly cycle their Chef-inspired burgers off the menu, but they'll still make them; as a result, I've literally been ordering from the \"secret menu\" for months. Ask for the Goulden with Cajun fries--you won't be disappointed!", 
      "A but pricey but the food was great, inside very clean, and the safety was attentive and friendly. \u00a0I'll be back every now and hen but I'd come more often if they could trim the prices a bit.", 
      "I liked it. Despite some not so positive reviews, they have a really good burger joint here. Found the place to be immaculately clean. Even the mensroom was spotless. \u00a0A lot cleaner than most of my recent Five Guys visits that had peanuts all over the floor, and garbage on top of the tables (China Town DC--you know who you are!).They kill you with too many fries, the burgers were good, very tasty and cooked to perfection, but my work colleague said his burger was too small. I felt my 1/2lb burger was appropriately sized. Service was friendly and fantastic and a manager-looking guy even bused our table.It's great to see a burger place like this offer a drive thru window.", 
      "Great burgers! I am not a fan of anything else on their menu but the burgers are worth going here.", 
      "First of all I do not care for hamburgers but once in a while I will get one. \u00a0I drove by Meatheads and noticed they had a drive through.& I decided to give it a try. \u00a0Not a big menu. \u00a0I had the kids meal which included french fries, cheeseburger and a teeny tiny drink.I am also not huge fan of french fries either (yes, I am American) but as far as french fries go these were excellent. \u00a0The cheeseburger was OK too. \u00a0I think it taste just like Culver's. \u00a0You can get a cheaper burger at Culver's but their french fries are gross so if you are going for the whole meal thing this place would be your best bet. \u00a0And they don't skimp on the FF, they give you plenty!!!The staff in the drive through were super nice.I tried to do a check in on Yelp here but it did not list it on my phone for some reason.", 
      "LOVE TO EAT HERE!!! Californian is the BOMB!!! And I love how friendly everybody seems...even when it's packed!", 
      "The atmosphere and service are great. Very modern and clean inside, and the staff was helpful and nice. The food, however, like others have stated leaves something to be desired. When I pictured a meathead burger in my mind I expected a huge beef patty, and instead get something similar to a McDonald thin patty. The meat didnt really have much flavor, and the sandwich pretty much fell apart. I will say the ingredients were very fresh, and they give you a ton of fries. Easily could split a order between two people. The coke machines are pretty cool and was more memorable than the food. I'll give this place another try sometime, but for the price, it won't be a regular go-to place.", 
      "Yuck. \u00a0Normally I like to try a place a couple times before writing a review but I will not be getting anything else from this place.My girlfriend's coworkers got take-out from here and she got a burger and a sandwich for me. \u00a0Her burger had avocado, lettuce, and tomato. \u00a0My sandwich was an ALT - avocado lettuce tomato on white bread. \u00a0So there was similarity.When we got it, the paper around both sandwiches was soaked through in grease and translucent. \u00a0This is not, in fact, necessarily a negative. \u00a0I didn't get food from a burger place to eat healthy. \u00a0I love seeing the grease on the wrapping paper from Derald's on their breakfast sandwiches.My sandwich was disappointing. \u00a0It had enough avocado - once I could find it in the almost half cup of mayonnaise on the sandwich. \u00a0The lettuce was iceberg lettuce and uninteresting. \u00a0The tomato was okay. \u00a0The bread was just white bread, fried in some kind of cheap vegetable oil. \u00a0That made the sandwich much \"heavier\" and unpleasantly greasy. \u00a0Like I said, I don't mind some grease, but this stuff tasted cheap and stale. \u00a0After eating it, I felt kinda sick later in the day. \u00a0My girlfriend's burger had much less avocado. \u00a0The patties were extremely thin and bland. \u00a0The bun wasn't great either. \u00a0For all they talk about fresh ingredients on the website, I am not seeing the quality reflected in the food.The prices aren't cheap, either - $5 and up even for veggie sandwiches and up to $10 for burgers. \u00a0Fries are extra - so we didn't get any, but I hadn't heard good things about them. \u00a0Compare this to Black Dog, where you get an awesome burger and fries or other side for $8. \u00a0Or Derald's, where the burgers are much cheaper and the veggies look more freshly sliced. \u00a0If you must eat at a chain, try Culver's, even that's a much better deal, I think.Since we got take-out I can't comment on the restaurant itself. \u00a0I would still never get food from them again.Edit: a note on this review. \u00a0After it had been up for a little while, I was contacted via Yelp message by someone from Meatheads. \u00a0They apologized profusely for my dissatisfaction and offered me a complementary meal in the future. \u00a0I haven't taken them up on it - I'm still not in a huge hurry to go back - but they are trying to address unhappy reviews, and I think that's worth noting.", 
      "My boyfriend and I were having a craving for burgers and decided to give Meatheads a try as opposed to going to our regular bar for burgers. We regretted it as soon as we took the first bite.The burger here was greatly unimpressive and meat itself was mostly tasteless. I like it when I have a rich beefy taste to the burger patty, but this one did not have a trace of it. (so much for advertising the beef ... ) The burger was dripping with grease and it soaked the bun with the grease which made it soggy. Needless to say, eating became a messy ordeal. For two burgers, drinks, and fries (regular and cajun) we spent nearly $22!!! I was thinking this was gonna be the best burgers I've had, but it was a huge let down.I'm not coming back for sure. Much too expensive, burgers AND fries were subpar. Even if it was cheap, I would pay more for something that actually tastes good. At least the people were nice. Decor was very modern and clean. Oh and they had the new coke machines. But those things wouldn't be any reason why I would come again.", 
      "We've eaten here probably a dozen times in the last six months, and every single time the experience has been perfect.We typically order the \"chef-inspired\" burgers (Californian, Hawaiian, Reuben, etc.). We've tried them all, and they're all great. \u00a0I've eaten burgers at a lot of places in CU and I'd say Meatheads ties with Crane Alley for my favorite burgers. \u00a0(I even like them better than, e.g. Seven Saints, Destihl, and other high end places.) \u00a0Crane Alley has fancier ingredients, but the quality is at the same high level at both places. \u00a0I think that's very impressive for fast food.The other meals are good too. \u00a0My daughter loves the chicken tenders, which are crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, unlike the dry chewy stuff you get at many fast food places. \u00a0She also loves the hot dog, which is a real footlong.The fries are really, really good. \u00a0And this is surprising considering they make them from fresh potatoes. \u00a0Most places that I have been to that make fresh-cut fries (including, e.g. Five Guys) make a soggy, greasy mess that tastes like raw potatoes. \u00a0Meatheads makes a hot, crispy pile of deliciousness that is really hard to beat. \u00a0And with the cajun seasoning on them they are my favorite fries in town. \u00a0FWIW they will also put things on them (bacon, cheese, etc.) if you want.The management at Meatheads is superb. \u00a0Whenever we go at a busy meal time when the place is packed, the manager is always out on the floor watching *everything* and picking up the slack wherever it's necessary. \u00a0This is exactly what a manager should be doing, but it is so rare in fast food that it is actually a pleasure to watch him and his employees do their jobs. \u00a0It's like watching a well-oiled machine.Cooking is my hobby. \u00a0I love fancy food. \u00a0But this place is my guilty pleasure. \u00a0I never thought I'd say this about a fast food restaurant, but to be honest it is my favorite American restaurant in town.", 
      "I saw this place at 10am in the morning while I was on my way to Charleston, IL and made a small footnote to stop in on the way back. \u00a0I pulled in around 2:45pm and the place had a good crowd in it. \u00a0I have a fondness and a weakness for a good burger...must...stop...in!The place was clean, the staff was professional and patient while I ordered. \u00a0I went with the 1/2 pound Meathead, Cheddar, Mayo, Ketchup, Mustard, Lettuce, Tomato and Applewood Smoked Bacon. \u00a0Hey its not fancy but I like the combination. \u00a0I ordered a large order of fries and was warned, I went with the small. \u00a0I also ordered a vanilla shake, I'm out of town I miss my girls and needed to eat my pain.I forgot to order my burger medium, what I got was absolute perfection. \u00a0The burger was like cotton candy, it melted in your mouth. \u00a0The river of fries were at the height of crispy perfection and the 'nilla shake, wooh!Over 11 hours later, I haven't been able to eat another thing, just not hungry, that was a good burger, as good as it gets! \u00a0'Nuff Said!", 
      "My wife and I went to Meatheads for the first time this evening. They did a great job remodeling the building. However...Our order was taken promptly, we were seated promptly although the tables were really close together and we felt like we were setting with six other people at our table. Even though the good folks setting on either side of us were pleasant and courteous, the seating did not make for a comfortable dining experience.I had a third pound meathead burger with all the fixings, a regular fry and drink. Our order was ready in supersonic record setting time and was brought to our table by a server. The burger was tasty and I really enjoyed the fresh cut fries. However...I understand turnover is important, especially on a busy Saturday night, and management wants to push as many people through the line as possible, but be reasonable. I have never felt so rushed or pushed to finish my meal as I was tonight at Meatheads. It was ridiculous! I barely got my last fry into my mouth before someone was hovering over me wanting to clear the table (and have me leave). Maybe it would be different say at 3:00 on a Tuesday afternoon. Maybe someday I'll find, or maybe not.", 
      "This is an okay burger place. It's a bit pricey. The fries are okay. Not much else to say.", 
      "The burgers are definitely a cut above. They are comparable in price to the nice burgers in town at the Courier, Esquire, Crane Alley, etc. ($4-$7, depending on what you order). My husband still thinks that the Courier has the best burgers, but Meatheads blew the competition away for me. You get a larger portion of excellent tasting beef for the price. Every burger has at least two patties. Nearly everything about my regular meathead burger was perfect. The only room for improvement is the bun...but it wasn't bad at all--just not as gourmet as the rest of the burger. They have lots of fancy options. My husband really liked his Cajun Burger (although it was pretty messy to eat!) The fries are fresh, cut thin with skins on, and also served in large quantities. I have yet to try the shakes because Custard Cup is right down the street...The ambiance is casual and clean--a wide variety of songs played, not too loudly. There's plenty of seating and room to spread out, although I have seen it get pretty packed. This would be a great place to come with a big group because you could easily push tables together. They give you a number so that you can sit down after ordering and wait for a server to bring your food. The food comes very quickly. They also have the world's most high tech soda machine, with a touch screen menu of more than your average options. There's a drive through as well.Obviously eating here costs more than a fast food place would, but it tastes so much better. You're not eating pink slime, chemicals, fillers, or trans-fats, and it's obvious. It's still cheaper than eating out at a \"sit-down restaurant.\" Tonight, my husband and I spent $16 for a filling meal for two and didn't have to tip anyone. When I'm in the mood for a burger at a casual place, this is where I will go.", 
      "Well, I went back to Meatheads with intentions to give it a second try. I figured this time I'd try an Oreo milkshake and a specialty burger, while sticking with the Cajun Fries. In all, this experience was much better than the first. The specialty burgers are the way to go, and the Oreo Milkshake was better than the Chocolate milkshake I got on my first try of Meatheads. I will be going back, but it's still a bit pricey to be my main choice of restaurant. Still, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good burger.Also, this time I noticed how involved Meatheads was with the community. They had a wall devoted to the sports for the high school's in the area. I thought that was a great idea. Just a side note."

      "Sushi Kame is the best place in CU to get sushi! It's off campus, but a relatively fast bus ride and walk will get you there. It's in downtown Champaign so you can do a lot of things before or after you eat. Conveniently, it's right next to a little independent movie theater!I've gone here multiple times during slow hours and busy hours. The service is consistently good and they clean your table before you're seated and give you a warm towel. During slow hours, Sushi Kame is tranquil and becomes an intimate dining experience. The food comes out fast and is a wonderful quality. I also really like the complimentary tea and vermicelli noodle dish they give you before your order comes. It's refreshing and cleanses your palate. The servers are attentive and I've never had to wait for water. Even during busy hours, they don't rush you.The sushi is fantasic and well priced. I like the spicy scallop roll, love love roll, and salmon rolls. Fresh fish that is melt in your mouth good. The rolls are artistically presented and gorgeous to look at. The chef really puts hard work into them.I had the udon on another visit and I enjoyed it. The soup is light and savory and it isn't oily at all. The udon noodles had a perfect al dente texture and together, they really made my day on a cold evening. The tempura is also another recommended dish. It's perfectly fried with no grease or oil and presented in a nice manner.On holidays like Valentine's day, they are super packed so I definitely suggest making a reservation. I walked in and had to wait 15 minutes with my boyfriend until we were seated at the sushi bar. That day our server was rushing around but did a fantastic job getting orders, people, and food around. We got the bento boxes and they are huge! They offer a lot of food for a great price and I took a lot home.At the end of every meal, they give you a chocolate mint, which is a sweet finish to a marvelous meal. I definitely recommend coming here for your Japanese food craving!", 
      "They are consistently perfect! The lunch specials for the bento boxes cannot be beat. \u00a0I get the salmon teriyaki bento box. \u00a0It comes with miso soup, delicious cold cucumber noodle salad, and then much more food. The veggie tempura is always perfectly fried and never greasy or soggy. The sushi is fresh and tasty. \u00a0Even at lunch, the service is usually pretty quick. \u00a0What I really appreciate about them is that the restaurant is so clean. \u00a0There is no dust in their venetian blinds or the fake flowers in the windows. \u00a0How do they do this?! \u00a0I ponder this question as I sit eating way too much awesome sushi. \u00a0I've had sushi at a few other popular places in Champaign but nothing beats Sushi Kame for taste and value.", 
      "I went there and had a daily special salmon sashimi, it only has 5 thin pieces and is 10.95$. I also had a soba, where the noodles looked exactly like what I bought from grocery for 3$ a bag, and it's 7.95$. You can't say a sushi restaurant is good, just because champaign doesn't have other good sushi restaurants. I think I will never go there again.", 
      "They have the best sushi in town. I don't know if I call it the best sushi but I do eat here when I crave sushi. There is almost always a place to sit so no waiting.", 
      "As far as sushi in the middle of the cornfields goes, this place rates pretty highly. I've tried other restaurants in town and keep coming back here. The wait staff is always attentive and I'm consistently happy with my order. Their soup bowls are huge and I can never finish them in one sitting...but I can certainly try! I usually at least get a caterpillar roll and have tried many of the others without ever finding one I don't like. The only downside is the creepy bathrooms out in the shared hallway with Farren's.", 
      "The first time I tried Sushi Kame I thought it was good. I didn't exactly try their sushi. I got the chicken teriyaki bento box and that was okay. My second visit I ordered various rolls. They were decent. I thought I would enjoy it more but it would either be lacking flavor or it wouldn't be enough. I do enjoy their appetizers- the miso soup and the cold noodles. I wish I knew how to make those. As for the ambiance, it's comfortable. It's good for dates or meetings. That said, it's a little more chaotic on really busy days. Expect the sushi to take a while especially when everybody else is ordering them. The service is fine as well. Nevertheless, I wouldn't completely forget about Sushi Kame. There's such a few selection of good restaurants when it comes to sushi at Chambana and Sushi Kame will still be able to satisfy your cravings.", 
      "Love this place!i am a big fan of sashimi, and sushi kame delivers.i think their sushi rolls are pretty standard, but don't be afraid to shell out for the nicer rolls if you want something really good.a lot of people are too reserved to try the ones that are actually awesome, so the tame ones are just that- pretty dang tamethe bentos are a good vareity, the tempura is delicious, and the main is always a wonder. i highly recommend the teriyaki salmon or the udon bowl if you dont roll with raw meats, but i do say this-their sashimi is fresh, good quality, and much larger portions and slices than the other fish joints in town. big ups to their lunch sashimi bento!dont be afraid to try something new here! it's all pretty delicious fare and no flashy items to bring up the cost.truly japanese - simple yet delicious. the food speaks for itself.", 
      "Love this place. We've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. Great food and a great price.", 
      "I'm very surprised at some of these reviews. \u00a0Both times I came to this restaurant I received rice that was cold on sushi that looked like it was made hours ago and on my last visit, got food poisoning.I honestly refuse to go back to a place that failed inspection with a score of 10 and then managed to stay open with a score of 40 (5 points above failing). \u00a0Honestly, Champaign really needs to enact a law to protect patrons by requiring establishments to post their score card on their doors like other cities. \u00a0Thank goodness for cu-citizenaccess dot org.", 
      "I really liked the sushi here. It's grey tasting and fresh. Plus, they have a really good tasting soup that is given before the meal. Just the waiting time was bad.", 
      "Their love-love roll is my favorite. I order it every time here and it never disappoints me", 
      "I love this place! Tried it for the first time this week and it will definitely be my new go-to sushi spot in Champaign. This is such a great little find for those looking for a nice, quiet atmosphere filled with authentic Japanese food.The service was great, and they even gave us warm towels before our meal began. They also provided miso soup and noodles on the house. They were delicious! I ordered edamame and the sweet potato sushi roll, both of which were fresh and tasty. I was impressed with how affordable the menu was especially in comparison to competing Japanese restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area. I can't wait to come back again soon!", 
      "We went here for lunch today and were SO pleased. Thank you yelpers for directing us here! We got two rolls and the sushi bento box and enjoyed everything we got. \u00a0The Love-Love roll was especially good, with each bite a little explosion of flavor from the cilantro, spicy sauce, and pepper. \u00a0Everything tasted fresh and was neatly prepared, and, while California rolls are usually just sushi filler, the two pieces in the bento box were fantastic and would actually be worth ordering on their own. \u00a0The Sunset roll was expensive, but good. \u00a0We will definitely be back.", 
      "If I'm going to buy some expensive sushi, I expect them to be of high quality. These sushi rolls were not. I ended up spending $16 to get a three roll special of California roll, spicy salmon roll, and spicy tuna roll. The spicy salmon tasted like it wasn't that fresh. The service was very amiable. I wish their servers wore name tags so I could thank them by name.", 
      "After trying four different sushi restaurants in the area, I would without a doubt say Sushi Kame ranks above them all. I came here with a couple of friends on a Wednesday night and had a very pleasant experience.The service was very good. After taking our order, we were served some miso soup followed by some cold noodles. Our sushi rolls were brought out not long after the noodles. Between my friends and I, we ordered rolls of spicy tuna, negi hemachi (sp), unagi, dragon, shrimp tempura, and crab. Everything tasted great. However, I personally liked the dragon, unagi, and spicy tuna above the others. It can become a little pricey but it is worth it for good sushi in this town. Overall, it was a \u00a0pleasant experience and I shall be returning soon.", 
      "This is the best sushi restaurant in Champaign, hands-down. \u00a0I don't like Yellowfin (inconsistant with freshness), I don't like Sushi Rock or Sushi Avenue (both cheap but neither tastes very good), I definitely don't like Kamakura (bad service and crappy food), I don't like Miso (Urbana...across from Carle??), Oishi is ok (#2 on my list for sushi, but a very distant #2 -- they get points for creativeness and plating) and Kofusion is local but is very over rated ($1 sushi night on Monday is ok, but most selections are cooked and have either cream cheese or something \"tempura\" worked into it one way or another). \u00a0And it still stands that there is no good gyoza in Champaign.... no one pan fries them properly... they're usually very soggy and the filling sucks. \u00a0Better off to make your own.They have bento boxes for about $10-$13 for lunch. \u00a0They start you off with a cold noodle dish (very good) and some miso soup.... I had my one year old son with me once, and they brought out more tofu cubes for him.... he gobbled them all down saying, \"More cheese! More cheese!!!\" (whatever gets him to eat tofu! LOL). \u00a0 The fish is good -- I mean, it's not the kind of fresh fish that you'd get in Tokyo or NYC, but it is GOOD. \u00a0The rice is seasoned well. \u00a0 The tempura in the box is also very good -- not a heavy breading like other restaurants have. \u00a0 I came in the other day at 1pm and it was BUSY. \u00a0The busiest I've ever seen. \u00a0There was only one waitress.... but the service was OUTSTANDING for it being one service. \u00a0She had some sort of system down because she had it down -- no one was left waiting or fuming. \u00a0Water glasses were kept filled, food was hot (or room temperature if you ordered sushi), food was prompt, checks were dealt with fast and I was left dumbfounded -- I couldn't believe how wonderful the service was that day -- I mean, I didn't want the waitress chit chatting with me but for the amount of tables she was dealing with, it was excellent. \u00a0I tipped her well that day..... and this is why I gave this restaurant five stars today..... usually it would be about a four star.... but her service (and I believe she is either the wife of the owner or at least a long standing waitress) was impeccable.", 
      "This place was much better than we expected after walking in and looking around, it is really not much to look at! But overall, we were really impressed. There were definitely some high points and low points to the meal. The service was very efficient, but in an inattentive sort of way. By that I mean, our drinks were ALWAYS full, but getting the waitress's attention to place our order was a challenge. The pacing of our meal was non-existent. We received appetizers of miso soup (really good) and a cold noodle cucumber salad (nothing special). We also ordered some gyoza, which was below average. It was soggy and poorly fried, I wouldn't order it again. The Spicy Tempura Roll and Spicy Crazy Roll were both well liked by the spicy folks. The Unagi roll was a good standard. The Crunch Dragon was my least favorite, the flavor fell a little flat and it tasted a little mealy. I really enjoyed the salmon and salmon roe nigiri. My favorite part of our meal was the side of veggie fried rice. It was a huge portion and tasted amazing!!! Overall, so pleased we gave this place a try.", 
      "My favorite place for sushi in Champaign. Lunch is my favorite time to go but the dinner selections are great too. We always order a variety of rolls. Anything with tuna is excellent. The rainbow roll is my favorite.", 
      "Not a big fan of it. Price for lunch is okay but not for the dinner. Worth a try but that's it.", 
      "I miss Japanese food. \u00a0I grew up in Southern California, with Japanese-American family and I'm jonesing here in the midwest for a good chicken katsu, or a decent Udon. \u00a0Kame's the closest I've come here to being satisfied. \u00a0I like it a bit better than Kamakura, and the servers are both friendly and on point.The miso's pretty good, the udon is a trifle underwhelming, but the katsu's quite lovely. \u00a0Although---you can get cheese on it? \u00a0WHAT THE HELL? \u00a0Is that a terrifyingly midwest thing? \u00a0Cuz I've never heard of this. \u00a0ICK.That aside, i'm bummed that they only have chicken katsu curry (one of my favourite things in life ever) one day a week. \u00a0I want it now ;)", 
      "After a recent visit to Sushi Kame, I thought I would update my review with even more positive, tasty comments and suggestions. \u00a0First (and this is kind of a silly compliment), I was impressed by their spicy tuna roll. \u00a0Most places use older, leftover pieces of fish to make spicy rolls, hoping that diners will overlook the borderline-spoiled fish once its been finely chopped and masked with mayonnaise and chili. \u00a0Compare that shady technique with the way it's done at Sushi Kame, where the chef applies the spicy sauce alongside WHOLE slices of tuna (not that minced stuff). \u00a0You can still appreciate the freshness of the fish without having it saturated in a misleading sauce. \u00a0As far as I'm concerned, the spicy rolls at Sushi Kame are totally legitimate.As usual, I was also delightfully surprised by some of the offerings on their \"daily specials\" menu. \u00a0For my appetizer, I asked for the takoyaki (a regional specialty from Osaka that consists of octopus encased in pan-fried bread). \u00a0This made me giddy with foodie glee--this dish is relatively rare in the United States, and much more so in the Midwest. \u00a0The takoyaki came topped with a classic Otafuku sauce and katsuobushi shavings (dried bonito flakes). \u00a0While not perfect, I give Sushi Kame props for serving a Japanese street dish and some delicacies beyond the usual expected fare at Japanese restaurants.Unfortunately, I don't think they offer the daily specials menu everyday (ironic?). \u00a0I think it's only available on certain nights during the week, but if you happen to receive that small, hand-written insert in your menu, I would definitely give some of their other dishes consideration.", 
      "Firmly believe this place is doing the best Japanese food in town. \u00a0Def the best bento boxes! \u00a0Their tempura actually tastes like, I don't know, tempura. \u00a0As opposed to other, trendier places in town where the tempura tastes like the fried veg you'd get at a county fair.The sushi here has been spot on. \u00a0Can't rave enough about the tasty and cheap eats.", 
      "Black magic, thats how they do it. \u00a0In a small city called Champaign, isolated in the middle of the United States, far away from any ocean body, the people at Sushi Kame conjures up some of the best sushi I have ever had. \u00a0In the middle of freakin Illinois, who would've thought. \u00a0My roommates and I were feigning for some sushi and decided to try out this place, what a great surprise. \u00a0Its a small joint, nothing fancy, with cute waitresses and cheap dining furniture. \u00a0But who gives a damn, they make the best Uni and salmon nigiri. \u00a0My all time favorite sushi is the uni (sea urchin). \u00a0Every place I have been to, except for one, had uni that tasted really fishy. \u00a0And I hate that! \u00a0But this place had the most buttery, savory, fresh uni that I have ever had. \u00a0It was so good, I ordered 12 uni nigiri pieces the third time I went. \u00a0The second time I went they had ran out of uni, crushing my delicate little heart into tiny tiny pieces. \u00a0 \u00a0The food is great, my roommates ordered some rolls and teriyaki dishes which were all excellent. \u00a0The prices are very reasonable and service is good. \u00a0If your ever out here in this quaint little college town, Sushi Kame is a must.", 
      "Two words: Golden Rice! You cannot go to Sushi Kame without getting the golden rice (sometimes called egg yolk rice, depending on who is working). Its phenomenal! Unfortunately, it sells out very fast and they don't always have it made - so I always make sure to call beforehand to make sure its in stock. Several times, they told me that they did and when I arrived, I learned that they had lied. So be careful.Their sushi is pretty decent quality, but nothing extraordinary. Its a bit on the expensive side and the rolls are somewhat bland, but if you know how to order correctly, you can get a great meal. I'd suggest getting either the Love Love Roll or the Vienna Roll, which comes with miso soup and a small cucumber salad. Then I usually get a house salad (it comes with a very good ginger sauce) and a side of golden rice. It comes to about $13 and leaves you filled to the brim - making Sushi Kame my favorite sushi place in Champaign.", 
      "Normally I'd leave 4 stars but the service wasn't up to par. Sushi was good by Champaign standards. But the service was slow, and we had to wait 30 minutes to be told they ran out of the dessert we had ordered.", 
      "One of my favorite restaurants in town. \u00a0It's great for a quick, delicious lunch for a reasonable price, or a nicer dinner. \u00a0Before eating, you always get the miso soup and cucumber salad. \u00a0With the lunch bento boxes, you also get a ginger salad, a few pieces of tempura, some caliifornia rolls, your entree choice, and some rice. \u00a0 The best choices are the sushi and the calimari, I think, but it's all really good. \u00a0The prices are very reasonable, too - about $7-8 for all that food.The soups are massive and very good, too. \u00a0I am not sure if there is anything better for a cold winter day or if you aren't feeling good.For dinners, there are meals like the bento boxes or sushi. \u00a0I've never been disappointed with the sushi here, either and it is definitely some of the very best I've had in the midwest. \u00a0They do not skimp on the fish, either - with the nigiri, there is always plenty of delicious fish. \u00a0Prices are reasonable, especially for what you get.This was the first place I had uni, the delicious creamy sea urchin. \u00a0It's a little scary looking \u00a0at first, but it is incredibly good if you are feeling adventurous.I've never ordered dessert because I've always been too full from the entrees.I have been here many, many times and the only time the service was slow at all was on a busy Saturday night. \u00a0Generally, service is quick and attentive. \u00a0Decor is not overdone.Like I said - one of my favorite restaurants in town, and definitely my favorite sushi place.", 
      "I've been to Sushi Kame lots of times, and it's always a great experience. \u00a0I would definitely say it's my favorite sushi place in the area. They start you out with a free cucumber and somen noodle salad. \u00a0It's small, but very appetizing. \u00a0I still can't figure out exactly what the dressing is, but I always drink the extra. \u00a0After that they give you a (also free) miso soup, which is pretty good as far as miso soup goes. \u00a0 \u00a0Oh, and the green tea is free and they use real matcha as far as I can tell. \u00a0It's got a really nice, light, floral taste.I've also been to Yellowfin a few times. \u00a0While Yellowfin is good, the reason that I like Sushi Kame more is probably their \"American Sushi\" combo. \u00a0For about $14, you get three pieces of salmon nigiri, three tuna nigiri, a salmon roll, and the house salad, which is lettuce with ginger dressing. \u00a0The slabs of fish on the nigiri are nicely cut and usually pretty thick, giving the sushi a rice-to-fish ratio that definitely favors the fish. \u00a0 Speaking of the fish, it has always been fresh and clean-tasting, never \"fishy.\" \u00a0Admittedly, I've only had non-midwest sushi once, so my basis for comparison is only other sushi in Illinois. \u00a0When it comes to maki, I usually stick with the simpler stuff that lets you taste the fish more, so I can't offer much of an opinion on the super tempura fried california rolls or whatever. \u00a0The unagi rolls are good though.I've had the sea urchin here as well, and while it's softer than the stuff at Yellowfin, there's also more of it and it tastes really, really good.", 
      "Ehhh. \u00a0It's better than Ko Fusion but that's not saying much. \u00a0I also am rather dissapointed that they serve the same things when they were running Sushi County on campus.. except with higher prices! \u00a0I don't really think their regular rolls (like tuna or even spicy tuna) is that good even though they are cheap. \u00a0I think the rolls with no fresh fish and more expensive (like dragon roll or any eel or crunch roll) for ~$10+ are good.The service is really mediocre.. they only have one or two waitresses that obviously don't have much experience. \u00a0You can wait a long time to order or even get water.I would drive to Chicago or Bloomington, IL and save your money. \u00a0They have yet to have a decent Japanese establishment in Champaign.", 
      "Sushi Kame is a decent sushi place in downtown Champaign. The sushi is definitely authentic, and some of their sushi was definitely right on the money. That the sushi was relatively cheap only made the experience even better.The interior is unassuming, which is fine, because it usually means good things for the food. The Nigiri was quite good, and the sweet rice was cooked perfectly. The rolls we had were Crunch (good flavor with a good crunch), sweet potato (best tempura-based roll I've had), Alaska (pretty good, I don't remember much of it, though), green turtle (better than the Crunch) and volcano (not nearly as spicy as it should be).I sort of wished the soy sauce wasn't just salty (it tasted like the stuff that comes out of the bottles at standard Chinese restaurants). Some of the rolls could have been a bit more flavorful. Overall, though, I'd definitely go back to Sushi Kame when I'm in town.", 
      "Sushi Kame, I love you.Ironically, I never come here for the sushi. Good sushi isn't very hard to find, but good Japanese food is especially in a town this size. Granted, service isn't very good. The waiters weren't very experienced, but to be honest I don't care that much about service.", 
      "this place is actually pretty good, and I like the fact that it's not too trendy looking inside.It feels more traditional, and the tempura is awesome! Yet, I guess it's not that hard to make tempura.I love, love LOVE when they give you the sliced cucumber, cold noodle and rice vinegar small plate. OMG! what a great way to start a wonderful meal of sushi.Plus, this place has a lot of good memories. My first dates with my bestest friend ever, and he's still in my life. Hm, maybe I should take him there for ol' memories.I HIGHLY recommend this place for traditional sushi/japanese food.", 
      "The best sushi place in Champaign, and the cheapest. They also give you a noodle dish, miso soup, and free green tea with your meal. Compared to Yellowfin, the food quality is better, the price is about the same, and the atmosphere is about the same. Compared to Kofusion, the price is better, the food quality is about the same \u00a0(although I prefer Sushi Kame's rolls), and you don't have to deal with the the pompous atmosphere you get at Kofusion.", 
      "Sushi Kame is placed in downtown Champaign surrounded by the more pricey restaurant such as Jim Gould, Escobar, and Kofusion. You would expect some overpriced meals at Sushi Kame but the items on the menu is reasonably priced. The food is simple and not gimmicky like the trendier places in town. Also the people are very polite. You can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. If you would like a warm soup for you meal, go for the Udon soup (I believe it's $2.00 for one tempura shrimp to be added with the soup). If you want something with a little bit of everything, the bento box consist of the meat and served with 1 roll of California tempura, salad, and rice. More importantly, the sushi is great and they never run out of fish!", 
      "Sushi Kame has some fantastic Japanese food and some of the best prices in town, especially for the quality. I've sampled several dishes from their menu, from sashimi to sushi rolls to noodle dishes, and I've been very happy with each and every one. I have yet to try Yellowfin restaurant, but in my experience, Sushi Kame easily beats the other area sushi restaurants in terms of quality and price. As a previous reviewer said, service isn't always the best, but, in my experience, that's only been in terms of table visits by the waitstaff (they seem to get overwhelmed easily). Having said that, they have always been friendly and our food has always been quick to the table.Oh, and they close for a few hours between lunch and dinner, so be sure to call ahead if you're not sure if they're open yet.", 
      "Of all of the places in Champaign, I think that Sushi Kame does Japanese food the best. I have gone twice and each time ordering something a little different and I can only offer praise to this restaurant.I once asked for a chicken tempura which was not on the menu but they went ahead and made it for me. It was really good so I am puzzled why they do not put it on the menu at some point. Their teriyaki glaze is quite good: not too salty but not too sweet. I also like the cut-up vegetables they put alongside it. The yakisoba is great too with a little more noodle than veggie and/or meat. The sushi, while I chose the tame Tuna roll, was very tasty and well wrapped. It tasted fresh and I felt like I did not have to pay an arm and a leg like I would elsewhere. The miso soup was also likeable and that is a big compliment from me because usually I am not a big fan of miso.Anyway, give this place a try. Definitely worth the trek downtown and it is the right price range for a college student.", 
      "Hey, who would have guessed you'd be able to get decent sushi and sashimi in the middle of illinois? Huge menu with probably something for everyone, including hot cooked items for those who don't want to order raw fish.Recommend:Rainbow - pretty goodAlaska - Ok a little spicyCaterpillar roll - great amount of sliced avocado to eel to rice ratios. Skip:Chirashi -- great selection. the white tuna and salmon were fantastic. the yellow tail and the tuna should have been fresher. mm, may i repeat, white tuna... mmm.. [this was previous review based on the time i went in the summer when no students were around]EDIT ::: WENT BACK AND TRIED IT AGAIN B/C I HAD A DECENT SET LAST TIME BUT IT IS NOT CONSISTENT. TONIGHT'S CHIRASHI was not good, I give it barely a 2 star. Fish were all poorly sliced, they even left 2 MUSHY chunks of the back end of the tuna with a trailing white dribble of tendon, DISGRACEFUL, all fish lacked flavor or seemed as if they were sitting under a plastic cover too long since they all had this strange empty taste and smell to it... that white tuna I wrote about before? this time it was a bit icy, with poor texture and no taste. then comes the ginger, which has gone bad and made most of the dish smell like a dirty rag. Perhaps all the customers during the school year makes it so they don't have to care as much about quality? Some fish also seemed precut and must have sat on the plate too long. NO no no.Maki - insignificant.Spider roll, non spicey - about half of the amount of crab that should be in there.Uni - sure try it if you are craving it but it's not a great representationKind and attentive service. Hot tea. Good presentation. Mediocre ambiance.Stick to the rolls.", 
      "Great sushi. They also hook you up with appetizers like Miso soup, noodle salad. I recommend you try the roll with the baked smoked salmon. You really can't go wrong with any of their rolls.", 
      "My favorite place in Champaign for sushi. Prices are reasonable and the food is delicious! I've only come for sushi, and have tried a handful of rolls, but the Spitfire roll (tempura tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, spicy sauce in a soy wrapper) is what keeps me coming back! You get miso soup and a little dish of noodles before the meal. Awesome! My friend also loves the beef soba soup. Service is very fast during dinner hour and the waitresses are very attentive.", 
      "The food is really good, but it's pretty expensive. If you want a great deal and want to try a little bit of everything, get one of their bento boxes. I got a chicken teriyaki bento box the last time I went - everything in it is so good. You get soup, tempura vegetables, a warm entree, a california roll, rice, cucumbers, salad, and more, I think but I can't remember. Their sushi tasted so good and fresh. Their chicken was really good, but the best thing was the tempura. I had never had tempura before, but it is to die for at Sushi Kame. In the bento boxes, you get an assortment of fried sweet potatoes, green beans, and other veggies. It was really the best part of my meal.It's just a little high to go often. My boyfriend and I usually only go when we're going to see at movie down the street at the Art Theater. If it was a little cheaper, I would make a huge effort to go more often.", 
      "I have no idea why this place is rated so high! I had many different rolls of sushi here and save for two, they were all terrible. Most of the rolls were doused with a very spicy sauce. I live in Texas and am used to spicy, but this was so much, I could barely even continue to eat the sushi (we had to stop). It was so spicy, you couldn't even taste any flavors of the roll... which completely defeats the purpose of sushi. The edamame was good but grossly overpriced at $3 for a tiny little bowl. The tempura sampler dish was really tasty and priced fairly. It took forever to get service any single time we needed anything, even though there was almost no one in the restaurant when I came one weekday night. I came here with my mom and sister based on Yelp reviews hoping to explore some new joints in the Champoobanana area and was immensely disappointed. I'll stick with Kofusion for all my Champaign sushi desires."

      "Don't ever dine in unless you're not hungry and planning to stay for over 3 hours. No doubt, the WORST service I've EVER experienced in my entire life. Yes, they were busy, but what restaurant in downtown Champaign isn't on a Saturday night? DEAL. 25 minutes for the server to take our drink order. Another 20 minutes to get our 4 waters, then we tried to order, but she ran away. Flagged her down and put in our order another 10 minutes later, then started making bets to see how long it would take to get our food. Mind you, we were already there for 55 minutes with only water. Needless to say, we all were under. It took them, I believe, 57 minutes to bring out 2 rolls, sashimi, and soup. ...but there were 4 of us. Our fourth order didn't come in until after everyone had already made a dent in their food (he felt bad and didn't want us to wait until he got his food). I was so angry, I can't even remember how the sushi tasted. We also didn't receive that cucumber salad thing that every other table received, and only got our miso soup upon flagging her down. We TRIED to be patient, we TRIED to get attention from any waitress we could, but nothing. I felt I should express how completely dissatisfied I was with the service to the manager, so I did (very kindly, btw). She responded with something along the lines of, well you didn't make reservations, then continued to say that because we hadn't made reservations, they're not obligated to cater to us as quickly as the customers that did. ...REALLY?Moral of the story? ...make reservations or you'll get treated like garbage here.", 
      "I don't know how long this place has been here, but I've been looking right past it for at least a couple of years' worth of periodic visits to Champaign. \u00a0My dad is a big sushi fan, so he was glad to discover another local option (Kamakura is still apparently his favorite, but I can't speak to their sushi as I've only been for hibachi). \u00a0The wait staff at Kame was friendly, attentive and kept our meal going at a great pace. \u00a0The kitchen was keeping up excellently with our staggered ordering.The vibe inside feels, oddly, much more like a Mexican restaurant.", 
      "The Love-Love Roll ($6.95) is what I order every time. It has everything I want in a roll and it's affordable and filling! I do enjoy the fact that they offer their guests a small portion of sliced cucumber, cold noodles w/ rice vinegar and a cup of miso soup before the meal. You don't get that anywhere else in town...Sometimes, it is difficult to have a power lunch due to the fact that the staff is outnumbered by its customers.", 
      "Awesome sushi rolls, extensive selection with some interesting options. I got the rolls with fried chicken in them - Chicken Run, different and tasty. I also got the Crunch rolls which were great. Everything was ideally arranged and fresh. Business travelers: OK for eat in, reasonably nice interior. I got takeout which was easy and not messy for eating in a hotel room.", 
      "The BEST sushi in Champaign!We love Sushi Kame and highly recommend it to anyone wanting outstanding sushi....fresh, flavorful,filling, fantastic!", 
      "Wow, I was surprised at how fresh the fish is here and how tasty the rolls are. \u00a0The lovelove doesn't sound good but I promise its amazing! \u00a0I have tried the bento boxes, nigiri (raw fish over rice) and rolls, everything has been delicious. \u00a0I travel quite a bit and rarely find a sushi restaurant in a land locked city this good.I will be back and highly recommend.", 
      "I love Sushi Kame- it's cheap, cozy, and the staff is great- very attentive and friendly! \u00a0They start you off with complimentary soup and a little salad. The sushi is fresh, rolls are awesome, \u00a0and this place has none of the fake pretentiousness of some other places. \u00a0Also, after your meal, they bring you a little piece of fruit- perfect! \u00a0:) A++ for service, sushi, friendliness, and lack of pretentiousness!", 
      "I was surprisingly impressed with Sushi Kame! My mom and I went for dinner and each ordered a bento box. The bento box is huge! and it has a bit of everything... some salad, assorted tempura, rice, california rolls (that can be replaced with any of their regular rolls with a small charge). Definitely don't recommend the bento box if you just want a light dinner. Luckily, I was really hungry so it was perfect for me! I ordered the Tonkatsu (Deep fried pork) bento box while my mom ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box. My tonkatsu bento box was really good except for the one piece of ebi (shrimp) tempura. I don't know how to describe but it just tasted really weird. I think they don't let the oil drip and dry after they deep fry the shrimp so it doesn't get nice and crispy. Instead, it was kind of soggy which was disappointed. Also their Tonkatsu sauce tasted funny. I don't know if they make their own sauce but it definitely didn't taste like traditional tonkatsu sauce. My mom's salmon teriyaki was delicious! Salmon was cooked so nicely and it came with sauteed vegetables as well. Between the salmon teriyaki and the tonkatsu, I'd definitely say the salmon was the better choice! The good thing about sushi kame was the service. Our server was really helpful and nice. She recommend the love roll to me in replacement of the california roll and what a great recommendation it was! Overall, I was very satisfied.. oh, did i mention that a bento box is only 12 dollars? All that food for 12 dollars!!!!! Amazing. Definitely will come back again soon.", 
      "My bro and i were home for xmas and seriously craving a sashimi plate. \u00a0After doing some pokin around, this is the place we were pointed towards. \u00a0The fish was fresh, which is the ultimate MUST for decent sushi. \u00a0Didn't have any rolls, just a big plate o' raw fish. \u00a0I was pleased that I could find this in Chambana.", 
      "I really enjoyed eating here. I was surprised at the small courses that were brought out in between-- cold noodles, miso soup, watermelon; it was a pleasant surprise. I'm not a huge sushi fan, but I loved the sushi here. They had tons of sushi combos to choose from, and were fairly quick at tending to our table. The decor seemed a bit cheesy, but the food was great!", 
      "My wife and I enjoy sushi. Of the sushi restaurants in the Champaign / Urbana area, this is our favorite. Their White Dragon Maki is fabulous, as is their Love-love Maki. Those two are probably our favorites, while we rotate through many other excellent choices. The service is always friendly. The experience is always enjoyable.", 
      "I went back for dinner. We had 2 different regular maki that were really good: the fancy spicy tuna and tempura sweet potato. I also ordered pieces of Hamachi (yellowfin) and Unagi (eel) that were also great. The unagi was as good as any I can remember. We also got their nightly special, \"the Ninja Roll\", which was filled with all manner of goodness and wholly delish. With tea for two, miso, and their little cucumber/noodle dish (miso and cucumber dish is included with all meals), the total was only $31.00. That is a really good price in my book, and is why I raised the rating.", 
      "Best sushi in town. \u00a0They're also reasonably priced, making sushi night possible more than once a month! \u00a0I like eating there before catching a movie at the Art Theater. \u00a0The service is great, they even give you warm washcloths before you eat - sweet! \u00a0My only complaint is the Udon soup. \u00a0It's not tasty at all - pretty flavorless in fact. \u00a0Other than that, everything there is great!", 
      "Sushi Kame was the first place that I tried sushi, and it made my fall in love with it. They have a wide selection of rolls for a very reasonable price, especially when you consider the little extras they throw in there between meals. This is the place that holds the standard for sushi for me, and most places don't compare. Great service, great prices, great food.", 
      "Sushi Kame is probably my fav restaurant in C-U! The food is fresh and awesome-ly priced, with a great selection of sushi fo beginners or sushi-pros! I eat here at least once a week!", 
      "Sushi Kame is probably the best Japanese restaurant in town. The interior is no Kamakura but overall it was great! I ordered a mixed tempura dish that had all my favorite foods. I also had requested that my side of white rice be changed to fried rice and boy did I make the right choice. Sushi Kame has the best Fried Rice. The rice had a coating of egg which is so hard to come by and had great veggies within it also. I was more than please with this restaurant and i will be more than happy to eat there again. The service was also good.", 
      "This is definitely my favorite sushi restaurant in Champaign-Urbana.The bento boxes are relatively cheap and HUGE, and every roll that I've had has been delicious. The salmon don bowl is pretty amazing, too. I keep meaning to try the noodles, but when faced with the list of delicious sushi rolls, I always succumb. Cute location downtown, and great staff. My only minor complaint is that they often seem understaffed, and the poor servers seem a bit overworked during dinner. \u00a0But they are \u00a0unfailingly kind, and the food is always delicious.", 
      "Food came out fast and it was tasty. \u00a0The made special vegetarian rolls for some in my party, which is always a plus. \u00a0Prices are very affordable and I would go back.", 
      "I definitely got food poisoning from this place. I do not usually have a sensitive stomach and this is a very rare occurrence for me. Other than the food poisoning it was good though. I went there for lunch and got the sushi bento box. The food was average but it was also a good amount of food for being relatively inexpensive.", 
      "For champaign, best sushi. Very good prices for its large portions. I highly recommend this place.", 
      "I woke up with a craving for sushi and in my experience Champaign hasn't been the best place to find a good sushi spot. \u00a0Regardless, I yelped to my heart's content and settled on Sushi Kame.To start, when I looked at the menu I was shocked at the prices. \u00a0They were charging $4.50 for a bowl of edamame and some of their other appetizers and sushi rolls were just way overpriced.The miso soup was very bland and the barely filled up half the bowl. \u00a0I work at a sushi restaurant and our miso soup isn't amazing or anything but it has flavor to it that the miso soup at Sushi Kame was lacking. \u00a0As for the portion size, I just didn't understand why they couldn't fill up that extra portion of the bowl...Next, the house salad. \u00a0The dressing is a staple that I've tasted at many Japanese restaurants and this one was just too sour and I couldn't take more than one bite.Now, the main course. \u00a0I ordered the Love-Love roll and the Sushi Special, which comes with 5 pieces of nigiri and a california roll. \u00a0I'm not a fan of the california roll so I asked the server to replace it with a spicy tuna roll and that I would gladly accept any upcharges. \u00a0She didn't know how much it would be so I asked her to just let me know. \u00a0She came back and informed me that it would be $0.25 extra. \u00a0She then returned 2 minutes later saying that it would actually be $1.00. \u00a0Now I wouldn't have minded paying that if she told me that from the beginning. \u00a0But it seems to me that if you're going to tell a customer a certain price for something you shouldn't go back on it...that was a little off-putting. \u00a0My love-love roll was okay, but the cilantro was a little overpowering. \u00a0I don't know if i would use whole leaves of cilantro in one roll..and the spicy tuna that came with my sushi special, well..it was one of the worst spicy tuna rolls I've ever seen or tasted in my life. \u00a0It had no flavor to it, and it was falling apart. \u00a0It was basically like the sushi chef put a piece of tuna and a little spicy mayo over it. \u00a0Again, because I work in a sushi restaurant I know that it takes a bit more preparation than that to make a spicy tuna roll. \u00a0And if you can't manage to make a simple roll like that, I don't know what that says about your skills. \u00a0The only thing that I enjoyed about my meal was the nigiri as the fish was fresh.Needless to say, I will not be returning.", 
      "Was in Champaign for the weekend & was jonesin' for some sushi. Went to sushi Kame after seeing good reviews on Yelp. When I walked in I immediately noticed that there were Japanese folks eating at the Japanese restaurant. Always a good sign. The service was excellent, and despite a somewhat limited (and eel-heavy!!) menu, I had a really tasty lunch with good quality sushi, at an affordable price.", 
      "i like sushi kame. \u00a0their fried rice is good. \u00a0their veggie sushi rolls have never disappointed. \u00a0but to the totally stressed out older lady who seems to run things over there...take a vacation, because you're rude to your customers. \u00a0on their menu it says they will make rolls to order. \u00a0i asked if an inari roll could be made for me. \u00a0basically a little fried bean curd wrapper with rice and cucumber inside. \u00a0i have made them myself, and it takes very little effort... and is extraordinarily cheap. \u00a0not at sushi kame! \u00a0the first time i went, the price was $6 for 4 rolls of this type. \u00a0i thought it was a little steep, but whatever. \u00a0it was good. \u00a0i enjoyed it.the next time i went.... the same order.... SIXTEEN dollars. \u00a0yep. \u00a0apparently inari rolls now have gold flecks in them or something, because in a little over two weeks the price skyrocketed by $10. \u00a0i brought it to said stressed out older lady, because she had taken my to-go order. \u00a0she just kept repeating that it was \"today's price\". \u00a0she totally seemed angry and upset that i had even asked. \u00a0i had though. \u00a0because....listen, lady... i don't think tofu has a market price like seafood. \u00a0even if it does... it's f'n tofu. \u00a0no one had to go out on the wild seas and wrangle it. \u00a0i paid it. \u00a0for some reason two cucumber rolls, an order of fried rice, and 4 inari rolls came to a little under $30 that day. \u00a0i gave that rude lady $16.... and i hated every minute of it and every minute of eating what now felt like total rip off inari.i haven't been back since that. \u00a0it's a shame too. \u00a0the food is really not so bad. \u00a0not gold plated tofu prices, but good enough.", 
      "Amazing food for the price. I love the cucumber salad they start you off with. The bento box is also awesome. It's great if you want just a little bit of everything and at around $8, it was well worth every penny. Their sushi alone is also amazing. It feels more like a traditional Japanese restaurant compared to other restaurants in Champaign. I'll definitely be back!", 
      "Soon after leaving Naperville, IL, I drove down to Champaign, IL to check out this small town in the middle of Illinois. \u00a0 Champaign is a true University town (unlike faux places like Duluth) and it offers a wide variety of local restaurants and great coffee shops. \u00a0Having a second craving for sushi, I stopped by Sushi Kame to see if it would be a good option should I wind up living there. \u00a0 The place was small and pretty empty as the University was on spring break, but the sushi was very good. \u00a0The spicy tuna hand roll was clean and layered (opposed to mixing chunks of ahi with the ubiquitous spicy sauce), \u00a0I also had the tempura scallop roll, which was awesome! Again clean flavor and the scallop was noticeably fresh. \u00a0 I had \u00a0a few other simple pieces and each one was well prepared. \u00a0I would definitely recommend Sushi Kame to anybody looking for a solid roll.", 
      "Waited an hour and a half for some of the worst rolls and steak teriyaki I have ever had.", 
      "This is the best sushi in Champaign-Urbana. After living in Japan for a short period, I am crazy snobby about sushi. Certainly, compared to the quality you could find in a major/coastal city this is nothing to write home about, but in a midwestern college town this is as good as it gets. I've not tried much here besides their sushi but what I've had I liked. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but the food is the obvious draw here.", 
      "Tried Sushi Kame for lunch today. I am no expert on Japanese cuisine, so for this Midwestern girl, the Japanese food was delicious. I had the salmon bento box and my husband had a chicken fillet. Loved my salmon and grilled vegetables. Had three pieces of vegetable tempura, two pieces of California roll, lettuce salad. The restaurant was not very busy for a Friday lunch time. There seemed to be one cook and one server running the place and we had no waiting. There were several people coming in to pick up carry out orders, too. \u00a0We will give them another try and be more adventurous in our selections.", 
      "Visited the first time a few weeks ago. I got the Bento Box (chicken teriyaki) for dinner. It was a LOT of food. I don't for CA rolls, so I passed that to my bf. Everything else was great, though. The BF got their chirashi, and he thought it was great. He has been back, and said it was good on his second visit.", 
      "Easily the best sushi spot in town. The prices vary from ridiculous to good, and the lunch bento boxes are probably the best lunch deal I've seen at a local Japanese place. I usually don't really notice service or atmosphere one way or the other but the restaurant is near perfect on both of these counts.", 
      "Heard about this on Yelp, my girlfriend and I went there for the first time today. I lived in Japan for 9 weeks a couple years ago and understand the quality of food and service that you get there, but I certainly wouldn't hold restaurants in Champaign to that same standard. This is a small University town and access to fresh seafood is limited at best.Having said that, I was rather underwhelmed by Sushi Kame. The server (a middle-aged Korean lady) was very demanding and impatient. My girlfriend takes a long time to decide what she wants and when we were given the extensive menu, I knew it would be a while. So I asked the server if we could order the egg yolk sauce with rice dish side-dish while we looked at the menu. She gave me a very accusing look, as though I was committing some sort of crime, and then scampered off to put the order in.When she returned, \u00a0I attempted to order several more authentic Japanese items like [kama] toro, uni, and oyster, only to find none of these were \"in season\". We settled on a special spicy salmon roll, the green turtle roll, and several pieces of nigiri.As others have mentioned before, the egg yolk sauce with rice was really delicious. It is very rich, so you will need to share it with someone. The sushi was rather ordinary (by Champaign standards). The rolls fell apart prematurely indicating the rice did not have the right consistency/stickiness. The ginger was mild in flavor, the wasabe obviously dyed horseradish, and I swear they served regular soy sauce, not the special variety for sushi, because it was extremely salty.I can't comment on other dishes on the menu, and they may be delicious, but I'm not likely to come here again. For me the rudeness of the server coupled with the subpar sushi was enough to deter me from this restaurant.", 
      "Love the Bento Boxes!", 
      "Great place and certainly less crowded than Ko Fusion on a weekend. The service was courteous and I really enjoyed the chirashi I had which is basically sashimi over rice. My friends also had the chicken teriyaki and a couple different rolls. We were all content with our meal and I definitely plan on coming back. This is a much simpler sushi place with more traditional dishes you'll see at a regular sushi place compared to Ko Fusion which has a lot of American sushi rolls and honestly sometimes gimmicks.", 
      "The asparagus beef roll was delicious! And u have to try the teriyaki beef! It's really tender and tasty!", 
      "Good sushi at reasonable price. Definitely try the spicy salmon role and spicy tuna roll.", 
      "Sushi Kame is the best sushi place on campus (and by on campus, I mean a 5-10 min bus ride on the Green, but it stops right in front of it). On the outside, the place doesn't look like much, but the interior has a warm atmosphere and the staff is friendly, if a bit overwhelmed (my only complaint was the service, but I attribute this to their being understaffed)If you're a sashimi person, be warned that the prices are a wee bit on the \"are you kidding me?\" side, but it's worth it; I don't know how they do it, but the times I've had their American Sashimi, the salmon and tuna were PERFECT - fresh, succulent, and slightly chilled. They have a large collection of rolls, and being a pro-spicy person, I like their selection of spicy rolls. Great place, and highly recommended", 
      "Sushi Kame is tied for my favorite place to get sushi in Champaign. The sushi is very good. \u00a0If you're going for lunch the bento boxes are hard to beat when it comes to bang for your buck! I've always been happy with the food. The service is OK, I've never had the long wait times that some others here have posted about. I guess my only complaint is that I tried the Chirashizushi once and while it was good propotions and delicious it was one of the less ornate presentations I've had. Of course for the price I couldn't really complain. So yeah- if you're in the CU area and looking for sushi, this is one of the two places I would recommend!", 
      "Probably the best sushi in Champaign. \u00a0Reasonable price and prompt service.", 
      "Lunch Bento set is of good value - the portion is decent and the food tastes great. \u00a0The ambience is also good and the restaurant looks clean.", 
      "After moving from L.A. where there's good sushi on every corner, I was a bit apprehensive about finding a good sushi place in the middle of Illinois. However, after reading the reviews here on yelp and going to try for myself, Sushi Kame gets a big thumbs up from me. An earlier reviewer complained about the service, but I've never had anything but attentive waitresses. Prices are more than reasonable compared to all the other sushi joints in town, and the sushi is excellent. The roll selection could stand to be a little more varied, but whatever. Overall, this place is awesome. Love it."

      "I have been in Champaign for more than 7 years now. I have been at Rainbow Garden so many times. I really love the food and the people who works there. I loved the Szechwan Chicken, Chicken with Napa Saut\u00e9ed with Black Pepper Sauce, Sole Fillet in Chili Bean Sauce (spicy), and many other dishes!", 
      "So like most Chinese sit down restaurants, all orders are generally meant to be shared so bring a friend. The entrees are relatively expensive and each of them can be shared by two people since they don't give you too much food. I thought that the fried rice was good, but the only reason it was good was due to the portentous amount of soy sauce that was blanketed over it. I also found it odd that employees were in the restaurant working on their establishment's balance sheets as well as folding napkins. Water is on my top 5 of favorite beverages and I have to say that the water here was absolutely filthy. Perhaps the worst aspect I experienced here was the server only speaking in Chinese despite knowing that there were English-speaking people at the table. He didn't address us at all and just choose to talk Chinese to the only person in the table to understand it. That was extremely rude and I was quite offended by it.", 
      "There are way to many Chinese and Tex-Mex places in the twin cities that are just mediocre or worse. \u00a0This place however always hits the spot for me. \u00a0The dinning area is not that big, and the tables are kind of close together. \u00a0Though I think the atmosphere is very cozy and welcoming. \u00a0Everything here is very clean as well.Quick service that is very friendly. \u00a0A large menu, and all is very well made and prepared. \u00a0Fresh and tasty food. \u00a0Lots of lunch and dinner specials as well. \u00a0I always love the dumplings (how can anybody not love them). \u00a0The different types of pork, chicken, and beef are all excellent. \u00a0From sweet n sour to BBQ or stir fry. \u00a0A small beer and wine menu. \u00a0I think the newer location in Urbana has a full bar, but here it is pretty bare bones. \u00a0Though the Gekkeikan Plum Wine is amazing. \u00a0I am not usually a huge fan of Chinese restaurants, but this is a great place cause everything is true to form, fresh, and well made. \u00a0In the States anyway, especially small college towns, there are to many crappy Chinese places that would make the health department go crazy. \u00a0If all were of this quality, I would go for Chinese more often.", 
      "Nuts and bolts: My boyfriend was in the mood for some hot and sour soup so I searched online for options in the city that served it. \u00a0We went for a quick lunch.Order: Hot and sour soup (for the boyfriend), crab rangoons (for me), garlic chicken (to share).Pros: Good portion size. \u00a0Hot and sour soup and crab rangoons were pretty good.Cons: We didn't enjoy the garlic chicken too much. We actually brought it home thinking that we would possibly eat it later. We ended up tossing it. Didn't compare at all to what we can get a home.Take home: I'll be trying out a new Chinese place next time.", 
      "Rainbow Garden is solid and authentic. It's a quieter, cleaner, and slightly classier alternative to the Chinese restaurants on Green Street. You can tell that they care about presentation with regards to their dishes. Their menu is pretty unique and the house specials are delicious. I like Rainbow Garden's fried tofu, sole fillet, deep fried pork, salt & pepper squid, seafood bird's nest, and pan fried noodles. I'm also a fan of their Korean Chinese fusion foods, something that's pretty common in the Chicago area. Overall, it's great to escape from the hustle and bustle of inner campus once in a while and enjoy a scrumptious meal at Rainbow Garden.", 
      "I have been ordering food from Rainbow Garden for ten years. Their food is delicious, it's always hot, and delivery is fast! My husband loves the crab rangoon, and I don't think I've ever had a dish I didn't like.Rainbow Garden is also a great spot for lunch. They have the usual lunch special: soup, spring roll and entree with rice for $6-$8. \u00a0The lunch specials are a great value, however they only include the common/popular Chinese restaurant dishes such as general tso's, princess, garlic sauce, etc. \u00a0If you want something different, you have to order off of the full menu. \u00a0But the food quality here is very good and everything tastes fresh. \u00a0I'm a fan.", 
      "I've ordered delivery from this place in the past. However, I enjoyed my first dining experience couple days ago. I am surprised to enter a clean and quiet place. Rainbow Garden had a nice oriental ambiance. I'm not referring to the tacky and excess Asian imageries on many walls of Asian restaurants in general. The interior space had a beautiful red wall with red/black elements and simple oriental decor complementing the space. You don't see many places like that at Asian restaurants. Enough with the wall color and such....The lunch special was a very reasonable price ranging between $5-$6. It consist of the type of meat/veg, your choice of fried or white rice, 1 egg roll, and your choice of sweet/sour soup or egg drop soup. The lunch portion is very nice and I think $5-$6 for lunch is very reasonable. However, their regular entrees after lunch might be a little pricey for a hungry, poor college kid. \u00a0My boyfriend and I have grown to have bigger appetite over the month. We shared a Mongolian lunch special with two jja jang myuns (black bean noodle with shrimp, meat, and assorted veggies) which was a little too much. The jja jang myun was very tasty and I would recommend people to try it, and they serve you pickled yellow raddish on the side. More importantly, I would highly recommend people to stop ordering delivery for once, get off their lazy butts, get out, and experience their dining service for once. :)Don't get me wrong, their delivery service is fast and good also.", 
      "Had lunch at Rainbow Garden for the first time and wished I discovered it sooner! As one of the few Chinese restaurants south of Green Street, it is worth a visit over China King.I had the sweet and sour chicken lunch special that came with a small eggroll and your choice of hot and sour or egg drop soup. - The chicken was battered just right and not too oily, and the sweet and sour sauce came with white onions, green peppers and carrots. I also appreciated that they only used white meat chicken.- The eggroll is small but one of the most flavorful I've had among the Chinese restaurants in the area.- The fried rice was among the best I've had with ample vegetables and scrambled egg- The hot and sour soup needed more vinegar, but I still liked that among the Chinese restaurants I've visited for lunch, they offered soup.Rainbow Garden's ambiance also makes it a nice date spout with booths and red wood themes. The restaurant is actually much bigger than you would perceive from the outside.My only complaint is it's hard to park in their lot given the giant billboard in the middle of it.", 
      "I like the place for the atmosphere and of course the food. I always order sizzler beef which it's good. They use different shapes of boxes for different dish for delivery which makes sure you have a larger container for soup.", 
      "Everything I've tried so far (Shrimp w/Garlic Sauce, Shredded Pork in Garlic Sauce, Empress Chicken, Beef w/Chicken and Vegetables, and Veggie Fried Rice) has been delicious, except for the Buddha's Delight, which was...meh (I'm not a squishy-tofu fan--ya gotta firm that shit up!). \u00a01 point was deducted for the fact that EatCU.com says you can order from them online, but Rainbow Garden says you cannot. \u00a0....?! \u00a0So, don't try that--you'll probably never get your food. \u00a0The delivery of the food was also kind of ridiculous (that is, the delivery guy told me to come meet him on the street instead of coming up to where I'm located, and when I did, I found out he'd come upstairs instead), and one of the dishes was missing. \u00a0In sum: Sketchy service, but it's made up for by the tasty, tasty food.", 
      "I have been in to eat once, and ordered delivery a few times (once from Rainbow Garden directly, and most times through eatcu.com. On that note, I cannot say that I have encountered any problems with ordering through eatcu.com, other than the last time my credit card number did not show up for them for some reason, and the person from RG had to take it over the phone).The time I went to eat there with a friend, I had a lunch portion of beef and broccoli. Not surprisingly, it wasn't the most amazing thing I've ever tasted, but it certainly wasn't bad. And, that is kind of what one deserves for ordering such an item anyway. Since then, my husband and I tend to order the pan fried noodles with chicken (you can ask them to hold the sauce if you prefer your noodles crunchier), steamed vegetables with chicken, steamed vegetables with shrimp, and perhaps moo shu vegetables once or twice.All in all, I am always quite satisfied with my food! One star withheld because they often do not read or follow special note requests.", 
      "The food was okay but some of the staff are very rude and uncourteous. I had a very unpleasant encounter during lunch time once when the person serving the food demanded a better tip from me when I was leaving the restaurant!!! I had actually tipped him fairly well and I think it is very unprofessional to vocally demand for more money even otherwise! He did not seem to care that I was a regular at the restaurant before this incident and I have decided never to visit the place again.", 
      "I ate it because I was hungry. \u00a0I got the spicy eggplant in black bean sauce and mixed vegetables with noodles. \u00a0There was hardly any flavor. \u00a0In the eggplant dish, they used Japanese eggplant, which is usually really yummy but the way it was cooked here, ti was mushy and just looked gross. \u00a0Like really gross. The other dish had no flavor really. \u00a0I am not sure what it was missing (well...flavor) but it was just not that good. \u00a0The crab rangoon were good though a little too cream cheesy.I dont know. The rest of the dishes that people got looked okay--no one was really raving about how good the food was. \u00a0It was reasonably priced.Like I said, I was hungry. \u00a0Hungry enough for it again when I am in Champaign? Probably not.", 
      "I've eaten at many Chinese places around the Champaign-Urbana area and this is by far the best one I have tried.Rainbow Garden is great for dining in or taking out. \u00a0The service is excellent and the food is always fantastic. \u00a0I've tried a few different things from the menu and have thoroughly enjoyed each of them. \u00a0The prices are about the same as any other Chinese restaurant in the area as are the portions (unless you have a large appetite, one dish can usually provide two meals). \u00a0My only complaint is that while dining in they do not provide enough rice with their meals. \u00a0This isn't a problem, though, as they are happy to give you more upon request.", 
      "Let me save you the trouble of coming here. Rainbow Garden is basically all talk and no walk. They invested considerably in the beautiful decor of their restaurant, but the food is rather bland and washy, and the waiters are difficult to talk to, are stuck-up and cop an \"I'm superior than you\" attitude.We were trying to ask the waiter if he could make the Mongolian Beef *non-sweet* and with straw mushrooms (rather than the ones that come with the dish) but he had so much trouble with the request that after a few minutes, he had to bring the manager to our table, where they both stood by our table with their arms crossed, looking down at us ominously, when the manager plainly said \"what is it?\"It turned out that they could not fulfill our request as customers, and they were pretty upset about us asking if this mushroom-swap was possible, so they made the rest of our stay hostile and cold, as the waiter stared at us from the corner of his eye while hiding behind some plants. Go to Peking Garden instead. These guys at Rainbow Garden need to lighten up!!", 
      "I would have ordered from this place again if the driver hadn't of scammed me for an extra dollar. \u00a0Look at your receipt!", 
      "During weekdays, I often stop by Rainbow Garden to pick up food as it has bargain lunch prices and is one of the few options on Neil Street that isn't fast food. \u00a0For around $5 to $6, you can buy a lunch combination meal that consists of a generous portion of your chosen entree, rice, soup, and an eggroll. \u00a0My personal favorites are the chicken and green beans, barbecue pork and snow peas, and cashew shrimp. \u00a0Some dishes I've tried in the past have been a little too salty and oily (the Szechuan vegetables come to mind), but I've enjoyed most of the dishes I've ordered.Of the Chinese restaurants currently in the Champaign-Urbana area, I would consider Rainbow Garden to be the best option for a date. \u00a0The outside of the restaurant might seem somewhat unimpressive and grungy, but the interior has a very sophisticated atmosphere, with white tablecloths and dark red walls.By American standards, the wait staff might seem rude at times, but their \"cold\" disposition is considered formal and polite in Chinese culture. \u00a0A previous review complained that the staff is unaccommodating and will not make adjustments to orders. \u00a0However, I have previously asked the owners about special items, and they have been attentive and considerate of my requests. \u00a0Rainbow Garden has also offered a special menu of delicacies during previous celebrations of Chinese New Year, though from what I've heard, they might not be repeating this menu in the future (still, I think it's worthwhile to check on any potential Chinese New Year specialties).", 
      "This food is legit. I have always ordered delivery from here. I usually never have anything to complain about \u00a0because Rainbow Garden is great. BUT, their owners/managers are always so angry for some reason. This is not the way to handle customer service, people! You can't yell at someone if they don't like the food they ordered! On the plus side of that situation, they gave me something else w/o charge. Braised chicken/shrimp/whateverelse protein is always good. Same with the lo mein ..I've had way more things there but I can't remember but it's great. Try anything. But the weird tofu thing it tastes like hard compressed dough that was uncooked and super dry ...", 
      "Surprisingly good - My advice? GO THERE . It's a much more enjoyable experience than typical mid-west delivery 'chinese' food. If you dine in the service is generally super-friendly, portions are great with carefully plated dishes, well-seasoned food and excellent prices.", 
      "I have to say, from the outside, I was scared to go in. \u00a0I quickly learned not to judge a book by its cover, because the inside was really well decorated. \u00a0It is decorated in a modern-traditional style and is light handed on stereotypical Chinese restaurant decor. \u00a0It felt very cozy and welcoming, which is a great feature.The food was very good! \u00a0It was presented attractively and the portions are enough to feed you for dinner and again for lunch tomorrow. \u00a0I ordered a vegetarian stir-fried noodle dish and was totally happy with my selection. \u00a0I tried a bite of my roomate's fried rice, which was a bit oily for my liking, but still tasted quite good. \u00a0 \u00a0I will warn you against ordering the egg rolls, because they are the frozen kind. \u00a0They taste just like the ones at Panda Express. \u00a0I think I would give this restaurant 5 stars if their egg rolls were bigger and homemade. \u00a0Over-all it was a pleasure to eat here and I will definetly go back!", 
      "I saw that Rainbow Garden offered Korean-Chinese food so I thought I would give them a shot. \u00a0I ordered a jajangmyeon and tangsuyuk for takeout. \u00a0Prices were comparable to what I would pay back home near Chicago. \u00a0The portions were pretty decent as well. \u00a0Taste-wise the jajangmyeon was good, but not as good as back home. \u00a0There were lots of pieces of seafood and meat in the sauce, although it was a bit greasy. \u00a0Another reviewer mentioned that they serve pickled radish along with the jajangmyeon when you dine in, they seemed to omit this with my takeout order. \u00a0Not a deal breaker or anything, but little details like this which would gain them another star. \u00a0The tangsuyuk was nicely fried and cripsy. \u00a0The sauce was a great balance of sweet and sour and overall it was a solid dish.I'll be coming back to Rainbow Garden in the future when I'm craving Korean-Chinese food.", 
      "Again, caveat lector, I don't like Chinese food very much or very often. After my last excursion for Chinese, I've become a brand loyalist to Golden Harbor Unfortunately for me, G.H. was packed like sardines tonight.Thus, it was Rainbow Garden, and perhaps we should chalk it up to my perpetually low expectations for Chinese, but I actually enjoyed this place. It's fairly reasonably priced, the decor is nice (i.e. not a whole in the wall) and unlike G.H., it's more of a traditional restaurant service experience. Where Rainbow Garden is scoring most of its points is that, as some of the other reviews have noted, the service was fantastic. By that I mean, we had food within 10 minutes of ordering it and glasses that never really got empty.The food was good, I suppose. I liked it enough. I'd come back. I wish they gave me some more rice though. I like a lot of rice.", 
      "We order from here on a regular basis. \u00a0There are not many places that will deliver to W. Champaign, but that has never been an issue for Rainbow Garden. \u00a0I first started ordering delivery from them 13 years ago when I first moved to town and lived in a different location. \u00a0 Sometimes we have the same delivery guy I had back then, and he remembers us too.My wife's favorite appetizer is the Pot Stickers, but the other appetizers are pretty standard fare. \u00a0We always order the General's Chicken and Barbecued Pork Fried Rice. \u00a0 I have recently been ordering the Singapore Style Rice Noodles, and they have been very good. \u00a0We've tried many of their dishes and all of them have been pretty good. \u00a0I'm a big fan of their hot-&-sour soup, over other similar places in the area. Delivery is always very quick. \u00a0I've also eaten in the restaurant for lunch a few times over the years, and that is also a pleasant experience. \u00a0This is our \"go-to\" place for Chinese delivery (partially for lack of many other options).", 
      "We first had carry out from Rainbow Garden many years ago as a gift from a friend. That gift resulted in our spending hundreds of dollars over the years ordering food from Rainbow Garden, which became our go-to Chinese Restaurant. Tonight's order consisted of General's Chicken, Moo Shu Pork and Mongolian Beef. Although the quality of this establishment's food is usually quite good, I was disappointed that tonight's dishes were merely average. The Mongolian Beef was not as hot as it should have been and had too much beef and not enough scallions. The General's Chicken seemed to have poorer quality chicken then usual. The Moo Shu Pork was okay, but also just did not seem to be up to the usual standard of excellence.Perhaps this was just an off night. I just hope that nothing has changed to make us rethink our preferences for Chinese food in C-U.", 
      "I went here on a Tuesday afternoon at about 5PM. \u00a0I was the only one in the restaurant, and there was only one hostess that had to juggle answering the phone, serving me, and helping people picking up take out orders.It went smooth enough though, and my order came fast, within minutes. I ordered the chicken with green beans, one of my favorite Chinese dishes back home. \u00a0Unfortunately... it's hard to believe I'm saying this, but the dish was completely tasteless . In fact, the only thing I could taste was the oil, and oil does not taste too good... The dish just seemed to be poorly cut chicken and old green beans tossed in some cooking oil and stir fried. \u00a0There was a little soy sauce, but it did nothing to add to the flavor, and only added to the color.All and all, the place is nice inside, and for only one waiter, the service was good. \u00a0Unfortunately, the food was extremely bland, and I will not be going here again. I probably could have done better at home.", 
      "I ordered General Tso's Chicken, Moo Shu Chicken, and Chinese spinach online. \u00a0Afterwards I got a call saying they were out of the Chinese spinach so I had them substitute for regular spinach, but they didn't even offer to just refund my order or refund the difference between the two dishes. \u00a0When I went to pick up the food, I didn't bother to check my order because the receipt had everything correct on it. \u00a0However, when I got home I didn't have any General Tso's Chicken, but had green beans instead. \u00a0So disappointed. Won't be ordering from there again or eating there if they can't get my food right.", 
      "Love their food and was a regular but I had to stop eating there because the food is soooooooo oily. I asked them several time to cook my food with the least amount of oil but that didn't work! If you don't mind the oil dripping from your food, then this is a great place, nice relaxed atmosphere, owner operated and very nice. They also deliver with min order of 10 or 20 depending on location.", 
      "My favorite Chinese place to get lunch in Champaign! \u00a0Tasty, fresh tasting dishes with good sauces - and I'm a sucker for a good sauce! :) \u00a0Their affordable lunch dishes come with cup of soup, egg roll, and well proportioned meal. I also really appreciate their service. \u00a0The owner is very friendly, and the waiter will usually remember what we ordered and ask if we would like it again. Great place!", 
      "Best Chinese food in CU. \u00a0Inexpensive/plentiful lunch options and relatively quick delivery time make this an excellent choice. \u00a0I typically stick the chicken dishes, but the Mooshu (sp?) plates are amazing.Once my girlfriend and I went to RG for dinner, and about 20 minutes after ordering the waiter came out and apologized for the delay. \u00a0The kitchen had lost our order. \u00a0To apologize, the manager brought out a free appetizer and entree. \u00a0On top of that he waived the entire cost of the meal. \u00a0RG really cares about its customers.", 
      "I recently got this for delivery which was very quick. Most of the food was good but I was not a fan of the amount of breading on the Orange Chicken. That just means I will order something different as the Shimp dish that my hubby got was really good. I have had other things from here previously that I also really enjoyed. The prices are reasonable and the delivery charge is understandable. Also the fact that they have Online Ordering now is a big plus. I will definitely be ordering from them again.", 
      "Super slow on delivery - over an hour and 15 minutes!!!The food is ok, a little too greasy for my taste. If you're going to eat from Rainbow Garden, go to the restaurant. They can't seem to get the order right for delivery or take out. I much prefer Green Jade (on Windsor), but they don't deliver.", 
      "I have ordered from them a few times before but today was different. I waited almost an hour and a half for my food. When I got it they forgot to give me utensils and white rice. When I called them to ask about it I was given a rude response and basically told that they can't do anything about it. The food is ok but the service is TERRIBLE!", 
      "We had originally planned on eating at Golden Harbor even though we weren't exactly satisfied with our food our first trip there. \u00a0They were packed, and lucky for me, my husband agreed to try this place rather than a Chinese Buffet (blech!). \u00a0We soooo over ordered. \u00a0We started with Sechuan Wontons which were tasty and inexpensive. \u00a0I ordered Basil Chicken, labeled spicy, and loved it although there was no heat. \u00a0My husband ordered General Shrimp which was the best General anything Chinese I've had. \u00a0He also had Beef Lo Mein that was pretty tasty. \u00a0The prices seem high, but when you see the portions, they are quite fair. \u00a0We have at least two meals each to take home with us. \u00a0I'm very pleased with the friendly service and the fact that $42.66 bought us 6 meals total. \u00a0So good!", 
      "i was in town visiting some friends and we had some take out from rainbow garden.the only thing that i am certain of is that this place has the most def tastiest (if that's a word) crab rangoon. it's crispy and chewy and filled with yummy cheese.next time i'm in town i will be sure to stop in and eat eat eat!", 
      "Tried the salt and pepper shrimp and another shrimp dish. Awesome.", 
      "This place is reasonable. I just like to get take out if I happen to be in the area and need a bite to eat. I like the Cashew Beef. The food is nothing special, but it's good and not too expensive.", 
      "The service is rude here. They are impersonal and impolite. The food is ok, nothing outstanding but not horrible. They have really good crab ragoons, and their jjajangmyeon is the best you'll find in champaign. In short: food is decent but service is horrible.", 
      "Nice place have been back multiple times. \u00a0Unpretentious on the outside, nice on the inside.", 
      "the reason I'm giving them only 3 stars is that they are rude on the phone and always seem angry, I only order delivery from them, other than that the food is good and they deliver fast", 
      "The best Chinese in Champaign, but not as great as in the suburbs of Chicago. \u00a0I order the vegetable fried rice, vegetable spring roll, and the vegetable soup. \u00a0The service is quick and the food is consistent. \u00a0I wish they did not have a minimum delivery charge...it is difficult for one person to order $10 worth of food."

      "Restaurant reviewThis place gets a 5 star based on the bargain price for mexican food. I can't say that food is 5 stars, often it is above average with what you would find at a mexican non-chain restaurant but the prices are a bargain for what you get. For the lunch special 7 dollars we got the mix plate that had shrimp, chicken, and beef on it This was quite a bargain for the amount of food you got. The ambience leaves much to be desired though so don't expect a classy restaurant. Expect great prices and solid traditional mexican food.Pro: inexpensive, free chips/salsaCons: Hit or miss entrees Hidden gem:Come for the lunch special, cheap and lots of varietyFree chips/salsa", 
      "A good choice - Always solid! \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0I used to eat here four times a week for lunch - love the chicken and shrimp fajitas. \u00a0Ice cold cerveza and great margaritas. \u00a0The atmosphere is so-so but the food is always amazing and FAST!", 
      "The ironclad rule of BBQ and Mexican joints is, the worse the place looks on the outside, the better the food is on the inside.Dos Reales looks like a dump. \u00a0The food is outstanding.First off, you'll notice the menu is enormous. \u00a0It takes some time to sift through all the options. \u00a0On a friend's recommendation, I got the burrito bravo - just an enormous burrito. \u00a0You can choose steak or chicken. \u00a0I ordered steak, but my girlfriend got a taco with the chicken and it was mindblowing. \u00a0(The chicken is shredded and pulls apart, like what you get out of a slow cooker.)If I went again, I'd go with chicken for sure.The house margarita was just so-so. \u00a0A little too tart for my taste.Service was excellent, quick and friendly.And everything is absurdly cheap.It's a shame they close so early, because this would be amazing hangover food. \u00a0(Someone needs to throw their hours up on Yelp. \u00a0The day we called, they closed at 10:30 p.m.)", 
      "This place shouldn't be as popular as it is. I got a enchilada, taco, and chulupa combo and couldn't tell the difference between the three items, they all looked the same. The sauces they use for their food was bland. As a Latino, I enjoy authentic food and good Tex-mex food but this food didn't fit into either category. This place will overcharge for a taco. Yes, their burritos are huge but any Mexican restaurant has huge burritos. I was confused on their decor. It looks as if three people decorated at the same time. Champaign has so many Mexican restaurant options, that it's not worth trying this one. I will not be returning here.", 
      "Love this place! \u00a0Food is so hot!!!!!! \u00a0Their margaritas although not made like a real Mexican one they at least have booze:). My #1 pick in CU:). Eat here often!", 
      "Not sure why this place is so popular. The food is not very good and is over priced for this type of food. The wait staff was unfriendly. The decor is lacking. I don't plan to return.", 
      "This by far is the worst Mexican food i have ever had. Their skirt steak was drier than a beef jerky and the sauce on top looked like diarrhea. \u00a0The so called best dish they serve, enchilldas tasted like Swanson's frozen mexican dinner. A huge portion of horse poop is still Kaakaa. \u00a0All the rave reviews are about their margaritas, so the majority of people are bunch of drunks who have absolutely no taste buds.", 
      "Three and a half stars! \u00a0I love coming to Dos, as we affectionately call it, whenever I'm in Champaign. \u00a0There's a ton on the menu to choose from, some good specials, and good prices! \u00a0Plus, who can pass up unlimited chips and salsa?Every time I've come here the place has been packed, which speaks about how good it is!I ordered the chicken enchiladas suiza- chicken enchiladas covered in a cheese sauce (yummmm) and served with sides of rice (refried or black) and rice. \u00a0The beans covered in the queso from the enchiladas is out of this world. \u00a0I have started making my own because it's that delicious. \u00a0My only complaint was that the chicken was little dry inside the enchiladas, but everything else was good.The server was very friendly and called us amigo and amiga. \u00a0Our drinks and food were served in a timely fashion too. \u00a0When we left, we had to push through a crowd of people to get out the door. \u00a0Love Dos!", 
      "Completely generic. \u00a0From the faux adobe building, generic bar, and at best mediocre food. \u00a0Though somehow this place is always packed and many consider the premiere Tex-Mex place in Chambana. \u00a0Service is not out right bad on purpose, \u00a0just slow and uninformed. \u00a0The menu is as generic as it gets, and without the nostalgic feel I get from Fiesta, let alone the uniqueness from Wedge, Escabar's, or Maize. \u00a0The who's who of safe, mass pleasing food items. \u00a0Which has its place, but really nothing I care for. \u00a0Nothing special bar wise either. \u00a0Salsa is week, chips stale, guac is not fresh. \u00a0That is just the starters. \u00a0Everything just uninspired.A place I can't even give a good old local star bump a la Fiesta Cafe. \u00a0Nothing I can really recommend here.", 
      "Wonderful atmosphere , best Margarita and awesome food! I had a seafood enchilada with cheese sauce and it was really nice- 3 enchiladas \u00a0one of each -shrimp,crab,tilapia . Good service as well.Not giving a 5 star because the restroom was not very clean", 
      "One of the best Mexican places in Champaign-Urbana. Every time I go, I'm never disappointed. I also love the decor. They definitely embrace their culture with the decor. Every time I go I'm seated in a new place and I have different decor to look at it. The whole restaurant is shaped as a adobe too.At my latest trip here, I had a margarita for the first time. I love that they had margaritas on their daily specials. It was a blue margarita and it was worth the $5.75. My friends got mango margaritas and those were pretty good too!I think the best part of Dos Reales is the amount of food you get for your money. You definitely get a lot of food for what you pay. This time around I stuck to just a carne asada quesadilla. It was so simple, but incredibly tasty. Also when you sit down, they give you a basket of chips and two kinds of salsa. I love when that happens. The service was pretty good, too. The waiter was attentive and would frequently refill our water. He also made a joke about refilling out margaritas.I'll definitely keep going back.Just make sure that you have a empty stomach when you go or you might end up taking home leftovers, which isn't bad a thing though.", 
      "I went here, and with the huge 45 minute wait, I was expecting amazing food, What I got was meh food, Our server was on top of the table, but my meal came out a good 10 minutes after my dining partners meal, and while the server was super apologetic, food should never come out so far apart! And to be honest the food I got well, it was just bland, and boring, It was terrible. Maybe its because \u00a0I am used to getting authentic Mexican food, but even compared to the tex-mex I get this was sub par. Although you do get a nice portion for the price that you are paying, so there is that.Long story short, this place is perfect for people with huge appetites, small budgets, and those who care about quantity over quality.In other words a typical college student. \u00a0I really wouldn't recommend it for anyone else.", 
      "I have been eating here for over 10 years, and it is amazing every time!Today I ate this steak dish that had shrimp, grilled onions, mushrooms, and cheese on it and it was so delicious I had so much food I couldn't even finish it!!Also our waitress was so efficient and courteous!!!", 
      "Nope, not a fan. I don't know how you can mess up a simple cheese quesadilla but they manage to.", 
      "I would recommend the chicken chimichangas and mango margaritas. Been going here for more than 15 years and the food has remained delicious! Classic tacos on corn tortillas with steak or shrimp, cheese and cilantro are also delicious. My friends love the Acapulco and the fajita quesadilla.", 
      "This was suggested to me and a few visitors to UI by a collegiate there. The route he suggested made it seem real close to campus, but it really wasn't. Nonetheless it was delicious! Pros: PricesMargs (via my friend)GuacamoleFresh chipsFajita QuesadillaCons:Salsa - kind of bland & didn't have that zing I look for in good salsa. Service - not terrible, but he kept randomly disappearing when we needed him", 
      "This restaurant has the best Spanish style cuisine I've had in Champaign thus far! I ordered the Acapulco, which seems like a fajita plate that included chicken, large shrimp and steak. It also includes rice and and an \u00a0enchiladas. In short, this is great food, health portion and a bed on a plate lol", 
      "Dos Reales is amazing! Pollo asado quesadilla is my go-to. You get so much food for a reasonable price. Margaritas are a must! They usually have margarita specials as well.", 
      "This is my favorite Mexican place in town! \u00a0Full disclosure, the Tex part of the Tex-Mex is very dominant, and yes, the food used to be better years ago. \u00a0If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this is not the place for you. \u00a0However, if you're looking for a tasty meal in a casual setting, with very generous portions, try them out. \u00a0My favorite is always the fajitas set, with sizzling fajitas, hot sides, and warm tortillas.", 
      "I came here with a big group of people, for a friend's birthday dinner. Though I'm an omnivore, the vegetarian options were apparently pretty good, so we settled on Dos Reales over a few other options. The service was great, and the waiters were welcoming. I ordered a carnitas dinner, which provided me with enough food for two meals. The pork was cooked to perfection, and the rest of the plate (beans, rice, lettuce, tomatoes) was pretty standard for Mexican food around here. I really enjoyed the sauce on the carnitas, which was the highlight of my meal. It could have come with a few more tortillas, though; the dish only came with three, which was definitely not enough for this huge meal. As much as I enjoyed the food, you have to remember that you're eating at a Mexican restaurant a few blocks away from the highway in central Illinois. The location and the atmosphere, even though the restaurant looks decently clean and well-kept, is still a little bit off, and I'm reluctant to give it a fifth star, as much as I enjoyed the food and the service.", 
      "Salsa with the beginnings of a kick and waiters who actualmente habla espanol does NOT an 'authentic' Mexican restaurant make. \u00a0Now I know I'm from San Diego most recently and Los Angeles before that, so I might be a bit more predisposed toward better Mexican food, but this isn't it.THe Chicken Milanesa was....meh. \u00a0The overall atmosphere was ....also meh.So far, my search for good Mexican food continues in C-U.", 
      "Um, this place is a tradition - a staple for all graduating UIUC folk like myself. \u00a0I didn't fully appreciate it when I was there. Senior year, I started going more often, to partake in the insanely cheap margaritas and filling, hearty Mexican food. \u00a0Now, whenever I visit my campus, I return to get my fill of the deliciousness.I love how incredibly inexpensive this place is. \u00a0Seriously, $16 for a 60 oz pitcher of margaritas? \u00a0WHAT? \u00a0We'll take two, thanks. \u00a0$9.50 for a big portion of fajitas with tons of delicious beans, rice, and guac? \u00a0Totes. \u00a0And if you order off the ala carte menu, you can practically pay with change from under your couch.It's actually pretty tasty too. \u00a0I looooove their tamales. \u00a0The bean burritos are pretty good too, and as soon as I bite into that familiar salsa, I melt. \u00a0They refill the chips constantly. \u00a0Portions are large and satisfying - it's pretty classic Mexican food for an American crowd, not reinventing the wheel here, but it's consistent and nostalgic. \u00a0The margaritas are always delicious, though sometimes they are stronger than others. \u00a0Service is usually very friendly and quick. \u00a0It's like memories covered in chile sauce with a side of beans and rice. \u00a0Dos Reales, I'll always love you.I bet this place gets mad crowded since they closed the Dos on University Ave. \u00a0Why on earth would they do that? \u00a0Shame. \u00a0Now you need to have a designated driver instead of being able to stumble back to Green Street after dinner.", 
      "Basically, a whole lot of decent Mexican food for not a whole lot of money.The place was packed with college kids, so it was pretty busy. The wait staff was excellent, with super fast service and just very attentive. The food though, was pretty standard Mexican fare. Nothing that really stood out. One disappointment though was the quesadilla that I ordered had this incredibly thick and disgusting cheese on it. Now I love cheese, but this just did not taste good, and I could barely take more than 2 bites out of it before giving up.Extra points for portions, for being cheap, and for blazing fast service.", 
      "Wow...fellow Yelpers (and Illini, more importantly)...really?! How can you think this is the \"best Mexican ever\"?! Even by Champaign standards, I'd rather go to Chipotle or Qdoba any day of the week (I know, that is saying a lot!). The first time I went here, my roommate and I both felt sick. For some reason, we got talked into giving it another chance. No miracles happened the second time either. The food is super bland and just tastes like a huge mess on your plate. I tried...I really did. But a lot of Illini are from northern Illinois...and with all the Mexican choices in Chicago, I'm pretty disappointed in yall :/", 
      "I've been to Dos way too many times now. \u00a0The food is generally mediocre at best. \u00a0The first time I went, we literally got our food 30 seconds after ordering (I'm still trying to figure out how this was even possible). \u00a030 second food simply can't be good and it wasn't. \u00a0They seem to keep all their basic ingredients in huge warming trays in back: mexican rice, refried beans, chicken, beef (and these ingredients just don't taste that great). \u00a0Then, they do some crazy fast assembly and bring it out after a short stint under the broiler. \u00a0The only time I've really enjoyed my food was the time I ordered fajitas (I don't think they've figured out a good way to make these ahead of time). \u00a0So, I'd recommend staying away from the combo plates, but once you do that the price isn't that great (~$10 for entrees).You must be thinking, If i disliked the food so much, why am I giving them 3 stars? \u00a0Damn good margaritas! Definitely the strongest I've had in the C-U area. \u00a0They always have the 32 oz pitcher for like $9.75, which split between 2 people, is more than enough to get you both pretty wasted (or, if you're really ambitious, just drink the whole 32 oz pitcher). \u00a0So, if you order the margaritas before the food, you likely won't care enough once you get your food to hate it. \u00a0Works like a charm every time! But, If you're not 21 yet, I'd suggest going to a place with better food!Service is generally pretty good. \u00a0I've only had 1 slow waiter, which isn't the worst track record for a restaurant. \u00a0Long story short: Bad to mediocre food, amazing margaritas, decent service.", 
      "Ohh Dos, how I miss thee.I have yet to find a comparable place in Chicago. Good, inexpensive food (WTF is IN that delicious cheesy goo? It's amazing!), and strong, inexpensive, not-to-sugary, tart, delicious margaritas by the pitcher.It's not exactly fancy cuisine, but I think we're all ok with that.Dos, we will continue to visit you each and every time we are in Champaign.", 
      "Dear Dos, Without you I am not a complete person. Even though I never went to Illinois I found myself making reasons to drive down there just to indulge in your burrito bravo. Thank you for all you do! Love, Luke", 
      "I'm surprised to say that Champaign has a fair amount of relatively authentic Mexican restaurants!I usually do Dos Reales by myself, and I get the food to go and eat it in my hotel room. \u00a0I love white cheese dip, and their's is pretty tasty. \u00a0Guacamole is also good, which I get on the Chalupa. \u00a0I've also tried their quesadillas, which are stuffed with fillings and white cheese dip (not flat).", 
      "My co-worker and I were passing through town and decided we needed to eat before we passed through. \u00a0We literally chose an exit and saw DOS Reales and decided to give it a try. \u00a0The parking lot was packed so we were wondering how long it would be to get seated. \u00a0Luckily, the place is rather large so we were seated right away. \u00a0The menu is huge...so many options. \u00a0I had a hard time deciding so I asked our waiter what he recommended and he said \"Acapulco.\" \u00a0I asked him what the most popular dish was and he responded with the same dish.I ended up ordering the Acapulco and the waiter said that if I did not like it, he would let me order something else instead. \u00a0When the dish came, I could not believe how much food was there! \u00a0The meat mixture of steak, chicken and shrimp was yummy. \u00a0The chicken enchilada included was good as well. \u00a0There were two disappointments. \u00a0The rice was not very good, it was VERY dry. \u00a0Also, the dish said it would be smothered in cheese but when it came, I would not call it smothered. \u00a0It just had a small portion of cheese on it.Regardless of the two disappointments, the rest of the experience was good. \u00a0I would recommend this place.", 
      "It's a toss up between here and El Torerro on which is the best Mexican place in Champaign Urbana.... but seriously.... you'll rarely find a Mexican place this good and cheap.Try the Fajita-quesadilla.... GENIUS.You KNOW you'll miss it when you leave the area... trust me :P", 
      "Dos Reales on Prospect is the ONE place to go in Champaign for amazing Mexican food. Don't even think about going to the one on University (well, unless you're on campus or the line at the Prospect one is ridiculous).Why they're awesome? Everything on their menu is delicious and comes in ginormous portions! And those of you who can finish a burrito bravo in one sitting seriously deserve some sort of medal.Also, Dos has SUPER fast service - your orders come out in like 5 minutes. I love not having to wait for food!!!", 
      "I'm from the Bay Area in California, so there are no shortage of GOOD taquerias in our area. This place did not even come close.I had a fajita quesadilla with chicken I believe, which was pretty disappointing. It tasted like they just used Kraft Singles american cheese in the quesadilla, which is definitely NOT the right kind of cheese for this sort of thing. The texture of the quesadilla just left a dry feeling in my mouth. The saving grace of this place is that they have really good tortilla chips that come with your meal, and the salsa was okay. Sorry to say, but I would probably not come back here again.", 
      "It's the best damn Mexican food in Champaign, and it's only given me the poops maybe one, two times? \u00a0In all honesty, the service here is pretty fast and polite, and when the food comes out I am rarely disappointed. \u00a0Very few items are strictly vegetarian as almost everything is made with animal fat or cheese. \u00a0However, if you can put the fact that in one way or another you're probably eating animal byproduct (or just product) then it's great. \u00a0I love the DR!Note: I never eat there anymore because (SURPRISE!) it's really fattening.", 
      "My husband's favorite mexican place ... probably on the continental USThe chicken creme is good and the burritos", 
      "I have lived in Texas and been to many a good place in Chicago and Dos Reales is really really good...Gringo food you may comment? 99.9% of all the places you eat at in the US are gringo food, so enjoy and stop being a cultural snob.Dos Reales does it right... Best in Central Illinois.Get the beef Chimichangas", 
      "It's pretty good by the typical American-Mexican restaurant standards in the area. \u00a0Not really actually that Mexican. \u00a0If you're looking for a chicken fajita to come out sizzling in less than five minutes, they're the place.The staff is always unreasonably nice for the amount of business they turn out. \u00a0The place is pretty clean and has plenty of seating. \u00a0The prices are good at about $6-8 a plate.Sometimes I wonder how they made my food so fast, though...", 
      "I used to be a Dos or Die kind of Mexican food eater. \u00a0However, after years of eating here I still like it, but it could use some more variety. \u00a0Everything you order is some combination of the same ingredients: \u00a0chopped steak or chicken, ground beef, rice and beans, lettuce, cheese, and sometimes guacamole and sour cream. \u00a0It's good, but it can be redundant. \u00a0The chips are horrible, but the salsa has a good \"kick\" to it. \u00a0My favorite has to be the fajita quesadilla. \u00a0I usually order it with shrimp and steak, and it is delicious. \u00a0If you like peppers and want a gigantic portion of food that you probably won't finish, then this is the meal for you. \u00a0Oh, and if you want fried ice cream be prepared to share--it comes in a whopping portion with a huge topping of whipped cream. \u00a0Another bonus is that it is kid-friendly. \u00a0The waiters are good with children and make them feel welcome. \u00a0The food is also a hit with the kids.", 
      "Loved it tonight, as always. Staff is totally accommodating. Service is amazingly fast. And yes, some of the food is americanized Mexican, but some of it IS authentic, and it's ALL delicious. And if you tip well, they will remember you and treat you like royalty. Of course, there's no reason NOT to tip well, as long as the service is friendly. And when the service is as good as it is here, a stellar tip is really a moral imperative.", 
      "I ate at this restaurant regularly for the 4 years I went to UIUC. After Over 90% of the time, I didn't even stop when entering the restaurant because they were ready to seat the next group-seemingly regardless of how busy the place was! The staff is remarkably professional, courteous, and polite. Then after they seat you insanely quickly, they prepare your food at lightning speed as well. Here's the kicker: the food is actually great! If you love cheap Mexican food, I can't imagine why you would go anywhere else in Chambana. I recommend ordering their chicken chimichanga a la carte. A great deal, no this and that to deal with on the side, and just enough to fill a girl's belly!", 
      "I haven't eaten IN the restaurant in a few years, but I will get takeout from here whenever humanly possible.This is arguably one of the best, if not THE best, Mexican restaurants in town. I stick with the chicken fajita quesadilla and words can't describe its tastiness.The real reason to write home? That cheese dip for the nachos which I think is Constitutionally liquid crack."

      "I will never understand people's inclination toward this restaurant. This is not Mexican food. It's an insult. Even as tex mex masquerading as mexican food, the quality is just not there. Come here if you're into canned refried beans, instant rice, with that fake 'mexican' blend shredded cheese on top of everything. Yo digo que asco.", 
      "My boyfriend took me here when we went to visit U of I, his alma matter. \u00a0He proclaimed it to be \"the best, most authentic Mexican food in town,\" so of course I immediately hopped on the bandwagon. \u00a0I heart Mexican food.We walked in, and the decor was good up until we walked into the dining room, but, we honestly weren't there for the decorations, so I was willing to withhold any judgment until we tasted the food. \u00a0It was pretty crowded for being 2pm on a weekend, and I observed many orange and blue outfitted students with friends or family, and I figured that there was a good local loyalty being represented. We ordered off of the lunch menu. \u00a0I had some type of steak fajita with peppers, and he had some sort of variety platter with an enchilada and burrito. \u00a0We also had two gigantic margaritas, which ended up being pretty strong for what I thought we'd get.The food arrived very quickly and our server was pleasant, but I was SO disappointed by the food. It was fresh and warm, but was just BLAND. \u00a0There was little to no seasoning. \u00a0I am not a talented cook by any means, but I could have replicated my meal at home and probably could have made it more flavorful.The only \"plus\" I guess you could say is that it's cheap and service is fast. \u00a0Maybe that's why all the college kids love it. \u00a0Me, I'd rather pay a bit more and have a flavorful meal that takes a little longer.I probably wouldn't go back if we ended up in Champaign-Urbana unless I was drunk and just needed a plate full of food to fill me up.", 
      "I wish the University Ave. location hadn't closed. \u00a0I basically live across the street from where it used to be. \u00a0Though maybe it's for the best, as I'd eat there far too often if it was still open...Almost every time my parents come down, we stop here for a pitcher of margaritas or three. \u00a0Call it a strange family tradition, if you will. \u00a0The margaritas are tasty and cheap. \u00a0What more could you want?Food to go with the margaritas, you say? \u00a0I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. \u00a0Ok, the refried beans tend to have a strange film over the top, but it could be so much worse. \u00a0They still taste fine. \u00a0And sure, the food might not be the epitome of traditional Mexican food, but that doesn't mean it can't be good. \u00a0Oh, the food's cheap too. \u00a0Cheap food, cheap alcohol? \u00a0Sounds like a winning combination to me!", 
      "I went here a few weeks ago while in town visiting friends. Four of us went here to celebrate my friend's 21st birthday. The service was a little slow but the food and prices were great!! I ordered chicken fajita tacos- so much food I couldn't finish! I also had a frozen margarita which was pretty good. We also sat outside on their patio which was perfect. We had let our server know it was our friend's birthday, and he and a bunch of other servers came out and sang and brought her a sopapilla dessert. Very nice touch.If I'm back in town sometime, I'd definitely go back!", 
      "One of the most difficult things about moving downstate was not having good taqueria food - and then I noticed my friend writing Facebook status updates about how he was having \"Dos for dinner\" or \"Dos delivers!\" It took me several months of building anticipation to finally drive myself to Dos to order a shrimp fajita salad to go. I swear that this salad could cure world hunger! The thing is HUGE, tasty, and came with chips and salsa! My salad only cost a little bit over $10 with tax and was prepared in under 15 minutes. Quite impressive!I dined here for the first time with my boyfriend and friend, and was equally impressed with the quick table and food service. We had lunch specials that cost well-below $8 with tax and were so filling. The restaurant's ambiance is nice and great for groups. I've even brought my parents here and they really enjoy it to the point where when they visit, it's likely for us to order takeout from here. My only caveat is that the food can be incredibly rich.", 
      "Dos is definitely the place to go if you're looking for a lot of food for a great price. I've been here too many times to count. It's a lot of fun to just go there to drink, be with friends and eat til your stomach explodes. On the weekends during the school year it gets pretty packed in there and you might have to wait but I would say it's worth it. I love the enchiladas supremas and the burrito bravo (and yes it is big and yes I ate it in one sitting once... sad). They also have great margaritas. If you have cheap college friends (which if you're in college I'm sure you have), this is a prefect place to go!", 
      "This place was frighteningly crowded when we went. \u00a0Urbana-Champaign has a lot of restaurants, but judging by the teeming masses at Dos Reales, you'd think it was the only place to eat in the entire universe. \u00a0They have a \"wait until your number is called\"-system, which worked okay, but that's only because one of us heard the faint shout of our number being called.I have nothing against the service or the food. \u00a0The service was incredibly fast, given how many people were in that vast Mexican food labyrinth. \u00a0Our server was nice, too, which I wouldn't have expected. \u00a0The chips and salsa were tasty, as was my food and margarita (the margarita was strong, which is oh-so-important). \u00a0We got to stay as long as we wanted without getting the stink eye. \u00a0Not too shabby.", 
      "Ok... \u00a0 I'm going to keep it simple. HORCHATA!! They have it. Not many, if any Mexican restaurants have this DELICIOUS beverage in the Midwest. In fact, some waiters looked at me crazy when I asked. Haha. Growing up in So.Cali. This seriously broke my heart knowing it was unavailable. So yes, if you never had it. You're missing out. Food is great. I don't care for their beans. Weird... I know... But I ordered some twice. No bueno each time. Something about it. So Carne Asada with corn tortillas. And a LARGE HORCHATA!", 
      "Every time I go here I eat so much food I think I might die. It starts with the delicious warm chips!! Mm. And since the huge yummy lunch combos are like $5, I can eat until I think I'm going to die and have leftover to take home!My favorite things I've had are the chiles rellenos and the margaritas, YUM.Word of advice though, if you try to take home the chips in your leftover box, they will return to soggy tortilla pieces in your fridge and it will be heartbreaking.", 
      "There are quite a lot of Mexican places in Chambana, but this one always seemed to be the place we'd go back to again and again. The food is cheap, the service is quick and the food is good. Good chips and salsa, they serve Coca Cola products, and they have a patio area too. My favorite was the fajita taco salad. Any of their \"fajita\" dishes - fajita quesadilla, fajita taco salad, fajita burrito - all of them are soooo flavorful. It's right off the highway too, so it's a worth a quick stop if you're just traveling through too! I probably went here around 10-20 times a year while I lived in the area.", 
      "This place wasn't bad. I got some sort of spicy enchiladas I think. My wife got chili rellenos. The enchiladas were good. My wife's weren't. They were mostly stuffed with cheese. My big gripe is the giant portion. I am someone who has trouble stopping. I appreciate when restaurants have sensible portions. I'd go back here to eat, but I want to try some of the more authentic places in town.", 
      "Easily the best Mexican food in champaign/urbana. \u00a0The chips are promptly served as soon as you sit down and their meals come out so fast you would think they had to have been made for some other table, but it happens consistently.I love the Pollo ala Parria as my main dish either at lunch or dinner, it never disappoints. \u00a0Go here for the best Mexican you will find in either city!", 
      "Best Mexican Resturant in town!!! I always bring out of town guests here and it is on my list for celebrations when my friends and I are doing a group event. It is family friendly and a nice enviroment. If you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner, I may not recommend the place because it is a somewhat noisy environment. I have been eating here for about three years and the food and service \u00a0has always been excellent.", 
      "Standard fare Mexican place, nothing to write home about. They do bring you free salsa and chips but the flour tortillas are outrageously expensive considering many place give you them for free or for a low cost. Food otherwise reasonably priced. Huaraches is so far my favourite Mexican place in town.", 
      "I have sentimental love for this place but the food is usually making me feel bad afterwards. Maybe just eat too much but meh.", 
      "Great margaritas. Many menu options. Cheese nachos are the bomb! Their fried ice cream is served in a huge sundae bowl covered with whipped creme and chocolate. The fried ice cream is easily something that could be split between multiple people and would be a great to split between a date or spouse.", 
      "Went here because of the good reviews--not impressed. \u00a0We got two bowls of \"salsa,\" the milder of which tasted like unseasoned canned tomatoes, and the other was pretty much the same except for a bit of pepper and onion. \u00a0We added some hot sauce not necessarily because we wanted a lot of spice, but just to give it some flavor. \u00a0Enchilada sauce was also pretty bland and tasteless. \u00a0Meat was good though. \u00a0I asked twice for a diet coke that I never received. \u00a0On the plus side, the food is inexpensive and plentiful, but there are better alternatives in town.", 
      "Yeah, so in C-U, the big question in mexican food is Dos or El Toro. \u00a0This is seriously a divisive issue. \u00a0But not for me. \u00a0It has never been. \u00a0Dos Reales rules the mexican food kingdom of Champaign-Urbana. \u00a0I miss their chicken quesadilla -- big enough for 2 easily and super cheap. \u00a0Service was always friendly. \u00a0If you go on a weekend night, be prepared for a wait. \u00a0But it WILL be worth it.", 
      "This is consistently pretty good stuff. \u00a0Nice bright space, good servers, and acceptably good food. \u00a0I actually like the Milanesa, thin breaded meat that you can put in tortillas with toppings, the best of anything I have had there. \u00a0CAVEAT: \u00a0The location on University is darker, seems to have poorer service, and lesser food than the one on Prospect. \u00a0Maybe they used that as a training location!", 
      "Pretty good. The portion sizes are big, so you are always full when you eat. It is hard for me to rate Mexican places because I don't go to them all that often. I wouldn't say its special, but it is a good place to go.", 
      "Cheap, good, authentic Mexican. \u00a0I also highly recommend their sweet tea and mango margaritas. \u00a0They also do take-out which is amazing because you can go in, order, and leave with your meal within 10 minutes. \u00a0Sure it's not as fast as McDonald's, but it's way better. \u00a0Only downside, it can get busy during high-peak times and the line can get long.", 
      "Delicious Mexican food (for Champaign). I love the food here, although definitely ask them to lay off the salt (everytime I eat there it is pretty salty but I don't like salt at all). The margaritas are also excellent- go with friends and get them by the pitcher (especially the mango)!", 
      "great portions! my favorite in the area!", 
      "If you live in CU and haven't been to Dos you need to go. \u00a0The first time I went I really wasn't impressed that much, but my longtime CU resident friend convinced me to go back and try something else. I did. \u00a0The Chicken Fajita Quesadilla.  It has to be one of the best and most satisfying \"Mexican\" meals I have eaten. \u00a0Don't think for a moment that this is real authentic Mexican, what it is is amazingly gooey, cheesy sauce covering succulent chicken, peppers, and onions all in and on a HUGE tortilla. \u00a0If you are in the mood for some Mexican flavors go here and order this. \u00a0Not only does it cost $6.50, but me and my friends usually split it between two people and with free chips and salsa plus tip get away for about $4-$5 a person, it rocks!", 
      "Townie white midwesterner's idea of good Mexican food. \u00a0Total gringo food - if that;s what you want.", 
      "I went there after constantly hearing about the hype, everyone loves this place. \u00a0I'm not sure why. \u00a0it was dirty, the bathrooms weren't clean, the food was average at best, the waitstaff was rude, and yet it was packed. \u00a0I think it's just college students who love to eat cheap, but if quality is what you're going for, this isn't the place.", 
      "My favorite sit down (but still quick) Mexican place. Love the enchiladas and the beans and rice. Also love being able to get a coke in a bottle with actual sugar instead of corn syrup. Service is always friendly.", 
      "So very disappointed in most of the reviews of Dos. \u00a0Yes, it is good, but they are so intent on getting the patrons in and out as quickly as possible that it really takes the enjoyment out of the whole experience for me. \u00a0If I want fast Mexican food, I'll go to some corporate dump thank-you-very-much. \u00a0El Toro is a step up, but the true gem of C-U Mexican cuisine is Fiesta Cafe. \u00a0The margaritas are outstanding, the fajitas large enough for me to split with my husband (that's saying something for us) and the waitstaff actually remembers their regulars. Te amo, Fiesta Cafe!", 
      "This place is awesome! The service is super fast, the food is excellent, the prices are reasonable. The Nachos Pollo Asado is perfect! The sweet tea is the best around!", 
      "Dos Reales makes good, cheap, and fast Mexican food. \u00a0I went to the Urbana location before it closed, and made the mistake of ordering something with the cheese sauce (blegh). \u00a0Now that I knew what to get, I was not disappointed. \u00a0The carne asada tacos were plentiful and tasty, but could have used more cilantro. \u00a0The servers are very friendly, but the addition of \"Amigo\" to every sentence got annoying. \u00a0Still, I think this place beats every other chain restaurant on Prospect.", 
      "We used to call this place the \"Dr.\", from the initials D. R. \u00a0Clever, for college kids, maybe maybe not. \u00a0But it was effective in the following types of sentences: \u00a0\"I'm hungover and hungry. \u00a0I need a DR.\" \u00a0Yeah, I know groan. \u00a0But seriously the food was always very large, very fast, tasty, and within budget. \u00a0I tried the rest of the mexican joints in the C-U and the dr. was always the best. \u00a0What can you ask. \u00a0Now, living in Chicago, surrounded by many, many Mexican restaurants. \u00a0I still yearn for the food here. \u00a0A case of memory being better than reality? \u00a0Maybe. \u00a0But I still get reports for younger folk at U of I that the dr. is still the sh*t (pardon my lang). \u00a0So it still gets 5 stars.", 
      "It's not the best Mexican ever, but its the best in Champaign. Usually pretty easy to get a table w/out much wait and they have a big parking lot. Loved it while i was at school, and miss it now. Still talked about by my alum friends, and a must-stop during visits to campus.", 
      "I really like this place because they have such generous portions for food at such a great price. As a poor college student, this is a great place to get dinner with friends without breaking the bank. Also, their margaritas are delicious!!", 
      "This review is a few years old, I'm afraid.When we lived in Champaign this was our favorite Mexican restaurant. \u00a0The wait staff was pretty cheerful every time we came and the food always came out fast, hot, and plentiful. \u00a0I LOVED this nacho dish thing that used to come out covered in lettuce. \u00a0Someone mentioned the white cheese sauce in another review and that was what I loved. \u00a0So addictively yummy. \u00a0It might have been the Guadalajara Special, but whatever it was I used to think it was funny having to find the food by excavating the lettuce. \u00a0That was back when I could get an alcoholic drink with my meal and not endanger my spawn, of course.Husband used to get the chicken fajitas. \u00a0Huge mound of chicken. \u00a0Like.. half a chicken or something, along with all the expected veg, etc. \u00a0I've lived in California (North and South) and Texas and I still recommend this place. \u00a0Yes, I've been to really authentic places. \u00a0I don't care, maybe my palate is polluted by Tex-Mex, but I still loved my favorite dishes at Dos Reales. \u00a0To be fair, I don't know about any menu items I haven't tried. \u00a0DOS Reales I miss you!",

      "dos reales is a reason for living. \u00a0never have i ever found such great food, served so quickly, by such friendly wait staff. \u00a0dos is everything i could have hoped and more. \u00a0if you go there and dont order the cheese dip, you are out of your mind.best two things on the menu:burrito bravosteak enchiladas (have them put some of the cheese sauce on them in addition to the enchilada sauce)but honestly, go with the enchiladas.bring lots of friends, drink lots of margaritas, and go often! \u00a0please take note of the typos and other quirks in the menu - very smile-worthy :)", 
      "Standard divey Mexican food. \u00a0Tasty and quick. \u00a0There's nothing special about anything on the menu, so far as I can tell, but it all tastes good, and it's an immense amount of food for not an immense amount of money. I forsee going back during future LEEP weekends."

Tender, perfectly seasoned and just heavenly. \u00a0Im not all that crazy about there sauce. \u00a0I could almost run down to Lil Porgy's and get a side of there mild sauce.

      "If they ever made a fast food place that served BBQ, this would be it. I kind of wish that the menu would be more clear. I didn't know that ordering chopped beef brisket meant that you got a sandwich. Here's the real problem of the place: the woman at the cashier register taking our orders. I have Yelped over 200 places and this is by far the worst cash register employee I have ever encountered. I've seen people who were lazy and not very smart, but no one has been as condescending and impatient as the hag that is taking your order at this restaurant. If we literally took more than one second to tell her what we wanted, she would roll her eyes and talk down to us as if we were imbeciles or something. I definitely did not appreciate that. Also, I definitely think BBQ tastes better if you truly take your time with it rather than outright rushing it (Well, I suppose this is fast food BBQ after all). I will say that the mac n cheese was quite delectable. The cornbread was also delicious, but had severe diminishing returns on flavor.", 
      "Hickory River is decorated in \"Generic Cowboy Chic\", however the food makes up for it.Fantastic, fantastic barbecue. \u00a0Delicious pulled pork, Polish sausage, and beef. \u00a0SO GOOD.If you aren't ashamed at your caloric intake--then you should go ahead and also have a macaroni and cheese side. \u00a0DELICIOSO.I grinned and was emphatically delighted by such a tastylicious meal. \u00a0However, it was a bit tempered by the awkward furnishing. :)",

      "This place is sterile, and set up like a cafeteria. \u00a0The audio system is likely blaring Texas style contemporary country music. The theme is Texas BBQ, not African-American, or North Carolina or Kansas City. \u00a0They have a system where you stand in line and tell the counter man what entree you want, plus a couple of side dishes, and he shouts it over his shoulder to the cook who plates it up for you on a tray. \u00a0Then you slide the tray to the cashier and select a drink. \u00a0You carry your own tray to a table you choose and they do the clean-up.Brisket is a specialty. \u00a0Sauce can be ordered hot, mild or mixed. \u00a0They also do a sliced turkey. \u00a0Meats can be bare on a plate or in a sandwich.Its very casual, TV sets constantly going, of course, because this is America.",

Everything I tasted so far was juicy and tasty, cooked to perfection, and the flavors were always spot on, and consistent.HR feature one sauce with three spiciness levels - and it rocks. I usuallychoose the hot one (different strokes). \u00a0The sides are fresh and delicious - trythe beans, chili, and slaw.The staff is usually friendly and nice.The dining room itself is modest and could be updated, but then again, it's a fast BBQ place; \u00a0as such, it shouldn't be too fancy. \u00a0Whether you're a hungry student or just a BBQ lover, don't miss this place.", 
      "Hickory River works magic with a beef brisket. \u00a0Every time I'm here, I get the same thing: \u00a0sliced beef sandwich with ranch beans and potato salad. \u00a0It's outstanding.Their other selections are good, but not nearly as amazing as the brisket.", 
      "This is the best place for a full barbeque meal in Champaign County. Li'l Porgy's has the best sauce, Black Dog takes cake for the best pulled pork sandwich, but Hickory River cooks the best meal.This is Texas barbeque. \u00a0Here, beef brisket is king.Of all the BBQ joints in town, Hickory River has the most side dishes and the biggest portions. \u00a0The sauce is incredible, and the cafeteria design means you don't have to worry about tipping. \u00a0Perfect. Some of the best BBQ this BBQ connoisseur has ever had.", 
      "Dear Hickory River,I miss you so much. \u00a0I live in San Francisco now and I still look back fondly on my college years and Hickory River was a big part of it. \u00a0I went to U of I for 9 years and probably ate here 80 times, and loved it maybe 78 of them. \u00a0I've never had a more consistently good restaurant experience than this one. \u00a0My mouth is watering every time I think of the sliced beef brisket with hot sauce and hot link sausage.... soooooooooo fricken good. \u00a0off the charts... the only bbq I've ever had that was better was Sam's in Austin. \u00a0Fee free to send me some sauce and brisket and I'll send you some warm winter thoughts when it's not snowing here.", 
      "Would give it five stars for CU area, but as far as BBQ rating I give Texas BBQ in TEXAS 5 stars. Tried the Beef Brisket and it was tender with great BBQ sauce on a toasted bun. \u00a0Greatly priced! \u00a0Even has a drive thru! \u00a0If you are a fan of BBQ you will not be disappointed. Check it out!", 
      "We pre-ordered our Thanksgiving turkey from Hickory River. It was refrigerated and we warmed it up for our T-day meal. It was the best turkey I've ever had - smoked and juicy!! In addition, when my husband & I picked up the turkey the food looked and smelled delicious. We'll definitely be back to try their other dishes.", 
      "We LOVE this place. \u00a0I spent some time in Oklahoma, so I knew good BBQ, and when I got here, I was pleasantly surprised to discover Hickory River. \u00a0The chicken and beef are both fantastic, and don't miss out on the potato salad, the cornbread, or the cobbler. \u00a0The coleslaw isn't quite what I expected, so if you're a fan of creamy coleslaw, skip it. \u00a0Atmosphere is VERY Texas, which leads to the Sooner fan in me resisting the urge to turn all the longhorn artwork upside-down. \u00a0(Guess now if it ever happens, you'll all know who to blame!). \u00a0Reasonably priced, and the service is outstanding. \u00a0Catering is top-notch, too; we had them cater our wedding rehearsal dinner, and every aspect of it was friendly, professional, and outstanding.", 
      "I came here since I had a taste for some good BBQ. \u00a0I got exactly what I was looking for.The service was extremely friendly and helpful. \u00a0The food was delicious. \u00a0It was very reasonably priced. \u00a0What else do you really need?I had the beef brisket sandwich and sampled some of a pulled pork sandwich. \u00a0Both sandwiches were great.I will definitely be back to this place again.", 
      "Ok, I have only had their food catered for the department's annual picnic, but I would be surprised if their restaurant versions were very different.BBQ Brisket sandwich: decent- nothing spectacular- the sauce is just ok.Mac & Cheese: Abysmal. Worse than Stouffers frozen stuff or Kraft. Mushy macaroni with a very processed tasting cheese. Mashed Potatoes: Tasted like powdered instant mashed potatoes from my elementary school cafeteria.For me, BBQ the meat has to be good- but the sides are just as important. Good mac&cheese, cornbread, and coleslaw are musts for a good BBQ joint. These sides tasted institutional- like they just got a delivery from the Sysco truck and heated them in the micro.", 
      "Food is decent, I usually get the pulled pork. The mix sauce of hot and mild is not too spicy.", 
      "Conveniently located right off of 74, we stopped in to get some BBQ while passing through. \u00a0Since we were on a time crunch, I was happy to see that the restaurant is cafeteria style and we were able to get our food quick, eat, and hit the road. \u00a0I had the pulled pork sandwich with hot BBQ sauce. \u00a0The pork was tender, flavorful, there was a lot of it, and I really liked the spicy BBQ sauce. \u00a0I chose mac and cheese for my side. \u00a0It was good , but nothing amazing. \u00a0They have lots of menu options, lots of different meats, sandwiches, platters, you name it. \u00a0We would definitely stop by when traveling through Champaign-Urbana again. \u00a0Oh, and they serve beer!!", 
      "After reading so many yelp comments that read \"It's okay for Champaign, but noothing like what I can get back home in California\", I'm happy to say...This BBQ place is better than what I was expecting for the midwest, but is nothing like the Q I can get at home in SC! Where's my mustard sauce? (Let the great debate begin!)Anyway, I got the pulled pork sandwich with mixed sauce (they have a mild red sauce and a spicy red sauce, and mixed is... the two together), a side of cole slaw, and a side of mac'n'cheese (all three ran about $8 together). The pork was tender and had a good flavor. The sauce was very smokey and on the spicy side..not bad but could easily overwhelm the pork. I also had a bite of my friend's brisket, which wasn't nearly as good as the pork (brisket just isn't Q where I come from). The mac'n'cheese was stouffer-ish, but the slaw was great! Pretty solid. Complaint: cobbler and cornbread should be served warm.I'll be back once I check out the other BBQ places in the area!", 
      "I had the pulled pork and it was very good. \u00a0I hated the bbq sauce but I am from the south and we make our bbq sauce VERY differently. \u00a0The mac and cheese was awesome. \u00a0Obviously made with real cheese. \u00a0The sweet corn was good, in fact, I don't think it even came out of a can. \u00a0The cornbread is awesome. \u00a0I've never had cornbread like that before and I wish I knew their secret.", 
      "Left something to be desired. It was more like a fast food joint environment and in the way the employees acted. The food didn't taste fresh and they put too much sauce on that tasted more like ketchup than anything else. Maybe I have a discerning BBQ taste because I lived in the south for five years, but it was definitely sub par.", 
      "Food has good flavor, but I would have preferred a bigger portion of meat and hotter food. They really aren't out to impress, only to fill your belly.", 
      "Heeding Yelpers' advice, I went for the beef brisket, and it was really good, very soft and tender, the way I like it; I totally recommend it. The price was reasonable too, as their large beef brisket (which is 8 oz) was $9.50, coming with two sides of our choice. The ranch beans was awesomely cooked.If I could, I'd give them 4.5 stars, but 4 is too low for them. You ask why? Well, I was expecting it be a bit more elegant. For example there is no waiter service. You enter their store, get into the line to order, get your food (very quickly) on a tray and then will go to find a place to seat. Another reason I wanted to dropped a half star is that they didn't accept my DISCOVER card (Although I'm kind of used to it, but nevertheless a nuisance). Another thing is the pricing on their small beef brisket. They ask for $8.50 for the small one, and $9.50 for the bg one, thus they're totally urging you to eat more (Not that the meal is bad, but too much meat isn't good for your health anyway).Btw, the sandwich prices are very reasonable, with most of the sandwiches being a measly $3.99. I didn't try them, but they come in small burger buns (think MacDonald's $1 burgers size) but with meat extruding from the bun, like twice as big as the bun itself. I guess it is probably enough for a meal. \u00a0 Another good item on the menu is \"meat from the pit\", which they sell by pounds. Basically if you want to bring them home, this is the best deal. If I'm not wrong, it was $9.25 for a pound of their awesome beef brisket (the same price goes for all other BBQs as well). I'll remember this deal for my next home party!All in all, a good place to eat. I'll put it in my regular eating place list from now on.", 
      "It seemed like my brisket should've tasted good, but it was swimming in sauce that they pour over it. The sauce was good and spicy, but sometimes I just want to taste the meat. My sides of macaroni and cheese, cole slaw, and cornbread really left much to be desired and really brought out the cafeteria quality of this place.", 
      "Have been here innumberable times: \u00a0Consistently high quality product, service, and reasonable prices. \u00a0The place is always very clean, and \u00a0they don't mind me lounging with a magazine or the Trib long after I've finished. \u00a0Price is reasonable, and the meat quality is the best in town. \u00a0Li'l Porgy's may slightly have an edge if you like sweet sauce, but I am a fan of HR. \u00a0Great place!", 
      "The food at HR is always solid. \u00a0The meats are always to die for, and the sides tend to be ok. \u00a0I'll say that on some of them, a little salt wouldn't hurt anything.However, I've never been to Hickory River where I wasn't overcharged.One time I ordered French Fries and was charged for waffle, or seasoned, or whatever else they have. \u00a0One time I was charged for an extra side. \u00a0One time I asked for water and was charged for soda. \u00a0I've let it go once or twice but darn, do I REALLY have to point it out every time?Anyway, the food's good, but I'd rather head to the Black Dog for a stronger smoke taste and better beer selection.", 
      "Mmmmm beef brisket with mixed sauce. \u00a0It has the whole cheesy cowboy theme to it, but it's pretty darn good bbq. They could definitely charge more than they do for their food, and the chili is really great. \u00a0The staff was very cheerful, but man it was cold in there, so wear long sleeves!", 
      "I don't eat here often as it is pretty far off my normally traveled path, but when I do I feel like it's a real treat. \u00a0I only take one star because of its location and I only eat the brisket, so I can't really vouch for anything else (though the husband likes everything else he's tried) \u00a0The mixed sauce was a little hotter than I was expecting, but I think that is just because I've got weird pregnancy hormones that make everything taste either hotter or less hot than they actually are. \u00a0That being said, their sauce rocks my socks and the brisket is so tender and yummy. \u00a0Not a \"classy\" place, with the paper towel rolls on the table and the silverware up by the register, but it's a BBQ joint. \u00a0It actually seems more appropriate that way :)", 
      "The best pulled pork I've ever had! This is one of my favorite places to eat in Champaign-Urbana!", 
      "Didn't think it was as good as other reviewers. \u00a0Thought my Ribs had a rubbery texture. \u00a0Would have given it a 1 star but the others I was with thought it was So So, so I'll give this place a 2 but that may be a stretch.", 
      "I wish I could give it 2 and a half stars. Not bad, but not that good either. I was surprised that it was an order at the counter place. I had the beef brisket. It was just ok. A good brisket requires no sauce. This needed sauce as it was bland. Unfortunatly the sauce tasted like ketchup.", 
      "Unbelievable BBQ. \u00a0Their fixin's are really good too. \u00a0Expect some crowds for lunch.", 
      "Great beef brisket. Fills you up! I thought the rest of the meal was pretty good. \u00a0You can mix and match here, and you get a large cornbread serving with your meal. \u00a0We also chose to get the dessert, which we barely had room with. \u00a0This is very similiar to a southern style BBQ serve yourself resteraunt. \u00a0It was tastey."

      "Came here for a conference and got to enjoy the reception here at the on site restaurant. Great wings, pizza, spinach dip, and fried mushrooms. Also great service \u00a0at the bar! The bar tenders were extremely accommodating and found chargers for my friend and I (with different phones) after ours had died.I would say 5 for service, and 3 for food.", 
      "Came here with a party of 15 (we had a reservation). They were completely unprepared for us. We arrived at 7 and they first tried to seat us at a table for 8. They then moved us to the bar area and sat us on 4 different round high top tables. Whatever, we can make that work.We all ordered our drinks and it took over 20 minutes for them to all be delivered. Mind you, many of us just ordered water to start with as we were going to be going out afterwards. 20 minutes is just insane to wait for water!Another 20 minutes goes by and our waiter (who's name I never caught) FINALLY came to take our orders. We knew it would take awhile for our food so we all sat and chatted. Food finally started coming out and as it came out he had no idea who ordered what, so we had to figure out what was on the plate and who ordered it. My food was alright, though at first it didn't come with the potato's that I ordered. Instead of just bringing me a side, he took my entire plate back and came back with mashed potato's very haphazardly placed on the side.One of our diners didn't get their food until almost everyone had already eaten. She ordered chicken tenders...they aren't that difficult to make!So up until this point we were all a bit peeved but could deal with it.The real disaster hit when he went to give us our tickets. Out of 15 checks, only 2 of them were right. He charged a pregnant lady 2 alcoholic beverages! It's not like he just gave her the wrong ticket, she was the only one that ordered what she got! So he just had no idea who ordered what.I got my check and it had an iced tea on it that I didn't order. He took my check to take it off and I didn't get a new check for another 30 minutes. I almost walked out without paying because we were getting tired of waiting, but I'm an honest person and I wouldn't have felt right leaving without paying.FINALLY the manager came out to assist him. Why wasn't she there the entire time? I have no idea! But she was about as much help as a log. She apologized, of course. But did we get any sort of compensation? Nope. She did decide to send the person that the party was in honor of a gift card to come back. Something tells me that gift card will go unused. I know I will never return to this establishment.Why was that poor waiter left on his own with a party of 15? Why didn't ANYONE help him? I saw at least 3 or 4 waiters pass by our table and not a single one of them thought that maybe he was struggling. Now, don't get me wrong...our waiter was about as personable as a stick in the mud, but still...we couldn't help but feel sorry for him, he obviously had no support from management.Get it together, Houlihan's. If you can't handle a 15 top, don't allow them. I doubt ANY of us will ever return to your establishment. And you really put a damper on what was supposed to be a really awesome night for our bride-to-be.", 
      "I love the House salad! Most times I go in and order it to go as I do not have the time to wait there to be waited on. The service there has been horrible ever since they opened. SLOW must be their motto!! It can be dead and you still have to wait forever! Oh and I have paid 3 different prices for my house salad?!? This last time I was there I had a French Dip (which I love) and the au jus was gravy!! It was thick and honestly nasty!! Won't be back there anytime soon!", 
      "Great food! Excellent place to eat out near campus. Could do better with reservations. They have missed mine twice.", 
      "I've been here on numerous occasions. At least 6 times. It's a convenient location and I always think my bad experiences are a fluke. I've come for brunch once, that was a bust. My other visits are during dinner. Of all the dishes I've tried, the worst was the veggie burger. Cold white rice with a few black beans thrown in and shaped into a patty.I'd prefer a bowl of cereal at home over this place. Hands down.", 
      "This is not the Houlihan's of my childhood! This is a classy, someone expensive, upscale establishment. With 4 adults and 2 toddlers, we were seated (thankfully) away from all the other guests (it was early maybe just 5p so there was a lot of extra space). The food was good and the staff was friendly and helpful. I don't live in the area, but if I did, I would be adding this to my list of go-to places for when company is in town.", 
      "Fantastic dinner last night. Seared ahi tuna and calamari for apps, scallops and stuffed chicken for dinner. The food was very good. I expected to wait much longer than we did for food since the campus was flooded with marathon runners. In and out in about an hour. My only complaint is with the service. Our waiter looked like he had just rolled out of bed and was annoyed he had to work. By the end of the meal we were finally able to get one smile out of him. Will definitely be back!", 
      "I stay at the IHotel for business often (bi-weekly) and have had dinner at Houlihan's on many occasions. \u00a0This restaurant is very consistent. \u00a0I haven't had a bad meal yet. \u00a0The filet mignon with mashed potatoes hits the spot on a cold night in U-C. \u00a0I'm pretty addicted to their Fat Spaghetti and Potstickers. \u00a0Weird combo? \u00a0Yes, but I crave them as soon as I check into the hotel. \u00a0The waitstaff is excellent, but a couple of the hostesses could be a tad \"warmer\". \u00a0Overall, this is great spot.", 
      "Don't come here on game day because you'll get a \"special event\" menu and there isn't anything good on it. \u00a0Yes this makes it easy for kitchen and staff, but it inconveniences the paying customer. \u00a0Why even stay open. \u00a0The service is ok, but you can tell some employees don't want to be here.Skip it on Illinois game days.", 
      "Sunday night we expected it to be slow, diners that is. However everything was slow. I ordered a filet mignon-medium rare and my wife ordered an almond crusted tilapia. We waited 30 minutes for our food and my filet was over cooked. It had no sear marks and appeared to be oven cooked. How do you mess up a steak? The tilapia was thickly crusted with something, with little specks of what may have been almonds. I asked to have my steak redone and to their credit they obliged, agreeing it was not done correctly. As my wife picked the mystery crust off her fish, my steak was redone. The second steak appeared promising (sear marks visible), but the cook obviously did not time or let the steak rest because this time it was rare (raw). Now I enjoy med rare bloody, but not cold raw steak. We had enough. Asked for a doggy bag and may give my dog a once in a lifetime treat.", 
      "If you're vegan, stay away.If you're strict about your vegetarianism, stay away.If you have any dietary restrictions, stay away.Unless you enjoy repeated occurrences of:1) \"Without bacon please\"2) Receiving bacon on sandwich3) Having the kitchen take the bacon off but return the same sandwich still covered in bacon grease. \u00a0Not really what I had in mind... Alternating visits yield either:1) \"Oatmeal is made with water\"2) \"Oatmeal is made with milk\"So either they change their recipe really often or the staff have no idea what's going on. \u00a0Vegan breakfast option: \u00a0Cup o' fruit\"Vegetarian\" breakfast options: \u00a0You've been warned.", 
      "We had a medium sized party \u00a0on a tight lunch schedule, so meals were preordered to save time. The waiter never introduced himself, never asked when our wholeParty had arrived and we had to ask for our meals which arrived at 12:45. Just about 5 minutes to eat before heading back to work. The others in the party said they could be a few minutes late so they were able to \"enjoy\" their food. I give quotes because I think my dish was terrible. Im not sure what the others thought but there were no oohs and aahs.I ordered the scallops which were small, way over cooked, and made me sick about a 1/2 hour later. \u00a0This is a major disappointment to be so bad when there is so much potential and talent in this town.", 
      "Staying at the iHotel for a conference. Pleasantly surprised at how good the food was! Tomato bisque (with grilled cheese fritter) and veggie mini burger were yummy and both tasted freshly made. Very quick service. Friendly bartenders both nights (sat at bar).", 
      "Because I would be arriving during Mother's Day weekend at U of I, I emailed ahead and asked if I could make a reservation since I knew it would be packed. \u00a0 I received an answer promptly and was accommodated. \u00a0Service was great and friendly. \u00a0Our party enjoyed chicken parm, fish tacos and the chicken wraps. \u00a0All were very tasty. \u00a0 \u00a0My contact via email, Sam, came over to our table and checked how things were going. \u00a0 We all enjoyed our experience and will be back. \u00a0Thanks to Sam and Pete for going out of their way to make our dining experience a pleasant one!", 
      "The manager was the rudest person we have ever met. \u00a0Went in there last Friday night with 6 other people and we walked into the bar and grabbed a table that was open. \u00a0He walked over and started to berate our group for not checking in at the hostess stand. \u00a0Then he proceeded to slam down menu's for us and said in a rude tone \"Here are your menu's\" \u00a0needless to say his lack of professionalism forces us to leave this horrible establishment. \u00a0I will never go back there and will tell everyone else to never go there!", 
      "Houlihans constantly underwhelms me... and by constantly, I mean the two times I've gone there. \u00a0I think that for the quality/taste of food, it's way over priced. \u00a0I have had the SW chicken wrap, which mentions jalepenos, but I found it incredibly bland. \u00a0My dad liked his sandwich... but it was like ham and cheese with mixed greens, it's not that hard.The decor is cool, I just think the prices are a little bit ridiculous for the quality of food in Champaign.", 
      "So here's the thing: after 4 times here the service has been consistently friendly but incompetent.For example, today I got sat in a nearly empty restaurant, and the host forgot to bring a menu. She said she'd bring one right back, and then forgot (I watched her stand at the host stand, bored). Took 5 minutes to get one from waiter. This is the kind of thing you'd forgive as a fluke, but you watch and see table-waiting basics being flubbed all over the place. Last time, I watched *three* different customers standing up and approach a waiter stand asking to find their waiter. My service was slow, and didn't anticipate common needs (like a coffee refill at breakfast).My food came out partially cold and partially hot, which is either a kitchen timing issue or a tardy waiter who left food sitting in the window too long.Seeing as it doesn't seem to be one bad server, I'd guess this the result of poor training--which is usually a management issue.If you can survive the service, the hip/classy atmosphere has rich dark wood, orange lighting, and attractive window bays looking at Memorial Stadium on the south tip of campus. The menu items I've had have been either decent or great.Worth a try, I suppose, but bring patience.", 
      "Houlihan's is kind of a pseudo fine dining version of a TGI Friday's. \u00a0The menu is similar to what I would expect from TGI Friday's, but the decor is a lot more trendy right down to the super obnoxious aluminum menus. \u00a0Although the menu items are fairly pedestrian, they have little twists (chevre on the bruschetta instead of the more expected mozzarella, for example) and there is a big focus on presentation. \u00a0This makes for wonderful looking food, but the taste doesn't quite hit the mark. \u00a0Some of the cool looking little food sculptures are also very difficult to eat. \u00a0My bruschetta came with a little minced olive tower that looked like a cross between a wine cork and something out of the cat box, which was none to appetizing.Most of the food I had tasted OK, but the fried asparagus stands out as being notably bad. One of my pet peeves is tough asparagus, and the stuff here was enough to make me go postal. \u00a0It was over breaded, over cooked, and the asparagus was actually chewy. \u00a0Gross. \u00a0I couldn't bite through the asparagus, so when I tried to eat it, the asparagus slid out of the breading leaving a pile of greasy panko straws on the plate. \u00a0The horseradish dipping sauce was good, but lacked zing. \u00a0At $10 for a dozen bad pieces of asparagus, this should definitely be skipped.As is usually the case with chains, the menu descriptions made the food sound divine but the taste did not live up to it. \u00a0It's not bad, mind you, it's just forgettable. \u00a0This was particularly the case with the \"mini desserts,\" which are actually full sized desserts; one is plenty for two people. \u00a0Thinking they were much smaller than they turned out to be, we got a $6 trio of pecan pie, banana cream pie, and chocolate cake. \u00a0All were very cold as if they had just been removed from a long stay in the fridge. \u00a0All were also very bland and had terrible texture. \u00a0The pies were both runny, and the chocolate cake was dry and made Hostess cupcakes look gourmet. \u00a0Like everything else, they looked fabulous, and were also very reasonably priced, but don't let that fool you. \u00a0They're really not worth it. \u00a0So overall, I give Houlihan's a resounding \"meh.\" \u00a0It's not bad, but I certainly didn't find it to be particularly good. \u00a0I'm giving three stars because the service was better than I would expect from a newer place so close to campus, and they definitely deserve credit for having such a well trained and capable staff.", 
      "I actually think this place is decent for a nicer version of TGI Friday. Service was good. Food was nicely decorated and tasted good. I got the filet mignon which was good but it wasn't worth 22 bucks. my friends on the other hand got fish tacos and they all liked it ($10). we got Bruschetta(?) for appetizer which was really good. Ambiance was cool. Decent (albeit expensive) drink menu. I mean, it's a fine dining version of TGI, what did you expect?Overall, I enjoyed my visit there. I would go back there again.", 
      "I'm done with this place. \u00a0I have been several times to this location always during lunch with varying results. \u00a0Today a friend and I were seated in a bar booth without asking, although there were plenty of other places on the restaurant side. \u00a0Our waitress was ridiculously slow. \u00a0She actually got slower as lunch wore on although I only saw she had three tables to wait on. \u00a0We were there from 11:50 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. for lunch in a near empty restaurant. \u00a0Asked for our checks at 1:05 she said in a minute. \u00a010 minutes later she brought them. \u00a0We waited another 15 and she never came back to run our cards. \u00a0We had to go to the hostess stand and get a manager to check us out. \u00a0The food isn't that good to give this another chance. \u00a0Won't go back, ever.", 
      "I agree with the first review...I get the feeling it is a step up from Friday's, but is a bit more trendy and refined. I was impressed nonetheless. The lighting was intimate and a great start to the evening of debauchery ahead.I had the herb-grilled chicken. Healthy, delicious. As a desert, my date and I split a creme brulee and a white chocolate banana cream pie. HEAVEN on my Houlihan's table!", 
      "My family & i think this place is better than it was before. \u00a0They are improving with every visit", 
      "Staying at the iHotel for the second time in a month. Staff is very nice but the lunch from Houlihan's was very disappointing. The tomato bisque was acceptable (I would give it 3 stars) but the flatbread was absolutely horrible (0 stars) -- oily, doughy, wilted arugula with 0 taste, and I am pretty sure some of the mushrooms were past their prime. The flavor and texture of the flatbread made me wonder if it was pre-made and then just microwaved, there was nothing fresh about it.", 
      "me and a friend went on friday 13th ... and service was nice food was awesome .. i had the chicken nachos and 4 an appetizer i had the smushrooms and a couple of caborna mojhitos .. nice portion and friendly wait staff ... just a great dining experience", 
      "If I could have given no stars I would. Worst restaurant experience in Chambana, again. Here for business lunch, group of 10. Out of veggie burgers, out of flatbreads, discovered both of these \u00a0several minutes after placing first ordering. \u00a0Waitress offered me the vegetarian alternative of a chicken salad; I explained to her that chickens are animals and murdered to be put in the salad. \u00a0Wait staff has messed up more than one order, can't remember who order what, meals are coming out one at a time. My suggestion, avoid and go anywhere else.", 
      "There was nothing good about our experience there who a group from work. Service was awful, waited 15 minutes for cutlery after food arrived . \u00a0Food was cold and 2 orders were wrong. Soda water was mixed with sprite. \u00a0Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong. \u00a0Hope it's not the norm for this place", 
      "I was only there once, waiting for the bus after the Home Show at Assembly Hall. \u00a0I was there after lunch hour but before dinner, on a Saturday, so things were very quiet. \u00a0Sat at the bar, was almost alone.The Fish Tacos were the best I've had \"inland\". \u00a0I'll go back just for them!The prices were a bit high, like many in-hotel places I guess they assume everyone is on an expense account.", 
      "They have changed the fish tacos and I do not like them as well as I did before. \u00a0If you sign up on Houlihan's website they send you a coupon on your birthday for a free entree up to $15.00. \u00a0I went today and ordered the Tao Chipolte turkey wrap with chips and salsa and french onion soup. \u00a0The wrap wasn't bad. \u00a0It had good flavor but the wrap itself was dry so it crumbled some. \u00a0The french onion soup was really good and the chips and salsa were OK. \u00a0All in all it was a good free meal. \u00a0The server was attentive and the atmosphere pleasant. \u00a0Very clean and chic.", 
      "You expect a certain level of a quality when you go to a chain, that's why you go there. \u00a0This Houlihan's doesn't measure up to others I've been to. \u00a0The service was awful, we waited 20 minutes for our waitress to show up at the table. \u00a0We then placed our order immediately so as to not wait even longer, and we saw her go to several other tables for very long minutes before even turning in our order. \u00a0So we waited another 30 minutes to get our food, which was NOT worth the wait. \u00a0I had the fish tacos, and the fish was dry and overcooked. \u00a0 \u00a0There are better places to eat in Champaign.", 
      "The service here is awful. \u00a0Though I can't say it was all bad, our waitress was pretty awesome. \u00a0She was on top of her shtuff. \u00a0First off, we wanted to sit in the bar Saturday night to watch the Olympics but there was a wedding reception going on. \u00a0Weird? Yes, but that's Illinois I guess. \u00a0We waited around for at least five minutes before flagging another server down to finally get a table. \u00a0I also gotta say, the drinks here (besides the long islands) are expensive! \u00a0They're about twice as expensive as other/nicer Houlihan's I've been to. \u00a0It must be because it's connected to the hotel. \u00a0Anyways, the food was hit and miss. \u00a0My bf ordered the panko shrimp. \u00a0Everything was perfect and delicious except for the coleslaw, which was like shredded cabbage and mayo that had been mixed two seconds before so it wasn't marinated at all. \u00a0I had the seared sea scallops. \u00a0Sadly, the scallops were more like bay scallops. \u00a0Pretty tiny in comparison to the same entree I got at a different location a few days earlier. \u00a0At least they were perfectly cooked, since the risotto was a fail. \u00a0It was starchy and unappetizing. \u00a0Needless to say, I doubt I will be returning to this location though Houlihan's is one of my favorite restaurant chains.", 
      "This place is horrible. \u00a0The food is raunchy, \u00a0it comes out cold and the Restaurant was so cold inside I wore a winter jacket in the summer. \u00a0Avoid this place unless you are almost starving.", 
      "Visited once. Personally, I thought it was overpriced for the quality and quantity of food received, and the service was lackluster at best.Five of us went after work for drinks; we didn't expect to have dinner, but we were all a little hungry, so decided to get a light fare before some went out to a party later that evening. I don't drink alcohol, so I ordered lemonade ($2.50, and it was just ok - not very tangy), and a cup of their potato soup, and house salad with blue cheese (each $3.95). I can't believe they don't have light French dressing......this is criminal.I was disappointed that the server couldn't keep the salad orders straight; unfortunately, two of us ordered salads with white dressings; her's ranch, mine blue cheese (since there was no French dressing!). The other gal had to serve as 'taste tester' to determine which salad had ranch and which had blue cheese dressing.For $11.26 (plus my decent tip since I'm not usually bitchy unless the service is really really bad!) I don't think I will likely return to Houlihans on my own free will. If however, someone really wanted to meet me there, I might go for the company and stop at McD's on my way home.", 
      "Poorest customer service I've ever seen in not just the restaurant industry but in any service. \u00a0Manager was unbelievably rude. \u00a0Will never go back next time I'm in Champaign and hope nobody else makes the mistake of going here.", 
      "I've been Houlihans several times and I am definitely a fan. While the service has definitely been dopey at times, our food has always been very good. The apps, entre's and even the salads have all been great. I really recommend giving this place more than one chance to shine. The only downfall I feel this place has is the prices- but it's in a hotel, when's the last time you got anything for a normal price in a hotel? It's like buying hot tamales at the theater-", 
      "Make sure you order the grease on the side. \u00a0 When I told our (clearly hungover) waitress that my grease-laden sandwich on stale bread was unacceptable, she took it back to the kitchen, where they clearly wiped it off with paper towels and threw it in the microwave before re-serving it to me. \u00a0She barely apologized before taking it off the bill. \u00a0Classy. The rest of my party's food was below average, as well. \u00a0Don't waste your money here. just use the little iHotel vouchers at the coffee shop. It may not be as large a meal, but at least it won't take half an hour for a hungover waitress to bring you coffee.", 
      "The food is pretty good at Houlihan's. \u00a0It is a fun place to hang out with friends. \u00a0Calamari is delicious. French Onion soup is very good. The service is adequate but not great. \u00a0Our friends dessert was added to our bill, by mistake. \u00a0It is an okay place to eat.", 
      "Yum! \u00a0That hit the spot! \u00a0I wandered around campus for a good hour looking for a place to enjoy a nice meal and glass of wine but had no luck near the college, so I came back to the hotel where I am staying. I wanted a steak but thought the 8 oz filet was a little pricey and large so I settled on the 4 oz filet (and subbed fries for a house salad for $2). \u00a0My steak was perfectly cooked and was served with a side of broccolini and a dab of buttery sauce for only $10!! \u00a0The 8 oz fillet is only $25 and comes with sides and a salad so that's not a bad deal either. I also had breakfast here this morning and was very satisfied with my scrambled eggs and bacon. I would definitely recommend this place. I know it's my first review, but it's legit. :)", 
      "Over a year passed since I had last stopped by Houlihan's. \u00a0A friend recommended coming here for happy hour. \u00a0Based on my prior experiences, I knew to keep my expectations low. \u00a0Instead, I had a great time. \u00a0I came back a few days later and had another pleasant meal. \u00a0As far as chain restaurants go, Houlihan's ranks well above average. \u00a0I've skimmed the other reviews, and I can't be sure if I've just been lucky, but I certainly didn't suffer the problems of other customers (e.g., bland food, poor service).Lunch options are generously portioned and reasonably priced. \u00a0Complimentary soup or salad is served with entrees, sandwiches/wraps, and pizzas. \u00a0I've tried the baked potato soup and chicken tortilla soup and have trouble picking a favorite; both are savory and very thick/hearty. \u00a0If you're concerned about skimpy salads, each of the signature salads come with a healthy proportion of greens-to-\"toppings\" (candied pecans, Gorgonzola cheese, chicken, etc.).The tapas-style menu really makes this a fun spot for happy hour. \u00a0There are a LOT of options here (more than 40+), ranging in size from small to medium to entree-size. \u00a0You'll find something, even if you're a picky eater (and Houlihan's takes special consideration if you mention being gluten-intolerant, vegetarian/vegan, etc.). \u00a0I love being able to pick out a few things to share with friends, but I can also see this as a great option if you have a light appetite and want truly modest portions of rich mashed potatoes or filling pasta. \u00a0(Or if you have a diverse appetite and just want to eat bites of a lot of different things!) \u00a0You can get small, \"appetizer\"-sized portions of their mac-and-cheese (yum!), grilled skewers, asparagus salad, and white bean hummus (DELISH). \u00a0I eat hummus as an appetizer at many places, and while they vary in success, I found Houlihan's hummus with grilled pita to be plate-lickingly GOOD (surprising especially for a chain!).The other essential element for happy hour are drinks, and Houlihan's is stocked with a full bar, along with a menu of suggested cocktails. \u00a0Some of these drinks are more sophisticated, compared to the corn-syrupy messes you get served at most chain restaurants. \u00a0For women watching their weight, Houlihan's also serves a number of fruity drinks from the \"Skinny Girl\" brand (great for minimizing the damage that restaurants can do to your diet).", 
      "This is delicious! I had never been to a Houlihans before and it is great. At lunch I get the mini burgers and salad combo and it is great- a little pricey. If it was $7.95 or so I think that it would be a better deal but the food is really good. At dinner time they have a menu that included mac and cheese for $6 and it is GREAT!!!! This is a place worth going!!", 
      "stopped down here for a quick lunch. my friend and i ordered a few of the small plates to share which ended up being the perfect amount of food. we shared the bbq chicken flat bread pizza and the spinach dip appetizer. we also each got a cup of soup. i had the french onion, which was alright. the pizza was tasty and the dip was relatively light considering how heavy spinach dips can be sometimes.service was great. our waitress was very attentive."

      "I've been to Guido's three times for lunch. I've had a burger and fries all three times, all were cooked to perfection and really tasted great. The first time I went alone as I work nearby. I expected the experience to be pleasant, if not speedy, as I was on a short lunch break. For some reason, it took a while to get the burger and fries. The waitress was accommodating and polite, but it took way to long - like 30 minutes before I had the food. Second and third meals there were all great experiences with less trouble than the first. The burgers are really good and the fries become awesome with the queso added. Its a decent enough place for lunch. If they sped up the service I would likely eat there more often.", 
      "I came here with some friends to grab drinks and dinner. My friend and I arrived first, and we were still waiting for 3 more people. Our server came up and asked if we'd like anything other than water and I said I would and just needed a quick minute to look at the drink menu. She walked away and was nowhere to be found for about a half hour. Even after our friends showed up, we waited another 10-15 minutes. We finally got our drink order in and no one was ID'd (My friend is 21 and I am 23...we honestly should have been...), and then waited about 20 minutes for 5 beers. We luckily got our food order in at the same time and waited at least 30 minutes for that (and still, one of the dishes wasn't even ready and took extra time). Every time we wanted another drink, we had to wait 10 minutes to get the server's attention and then another 15-20 to actually get our drinks. Our server did not seem to be overly busy, wasn't at all in a rush, and never once apologized for the poor service/long wait. As a server in the area, I was very disappointed with the service my friends and I received and probably will not return here.", 
      "The food is fantastic -- if you're willing to wait an hour for it after you've ordered. It was a busy night, and they were short staffed, I know. But if that was the case, I would have preferred that the server alert us to the expected delay. It's all reasonably priced. Almost every entree item was under $10. Everything is a burger or sandwich of some kind. There are a few salads, too. I would probably return, but I don't think I'll ever go on the weekend again. I expect faster service.", 
      "Came here during Pygmalion and the outside had plenty of seating open so we thought it would be great- it's in a prime people-watching location in downtown Champaign. Unfortunately the service was EXTREMELY slow. \u00a0We waited 30 minutes for drinks and another hour on top of that for a couple of bean burgers that definitely weren't worth the wait. \u00a0 \u00a0I have to say that the waitress was extremely nice and very apologetic about the wait, but it was seriously ridiculous. \u00a0It's probably a good place to go if you've had a couple drinks already, aren't in ANY hurry and just want bar food. \u00a0It was a definite bar-feel inside and like I said, good location for sitting outdoors. \u00a0That was the appeal, but \u00a0I won't waste my time again.", 
      "Very disappointing tonight. I know it's pub food, so I didn't expect haute cuisine, but we hit on the evening (apparently) when seemingly half the menu, including the advertised special, are no longer being offered. I wouldn't even have minded this if we had been told when we were given our menus, but the server told us nothing about until we ordered all the wrong things. Service was slow and not terribly accurate, food was mediocre at best. I hate to pan a restaurant, but a good mood was impossible after this. Grateful that we have plenty of better options in downtown.", 
      "Can you review a place based on 1 dish?If you come here for food, alright, the nachos are out of this world. Get em with meat and be prepared to eat nonstop for a while. I would rate the nachos at Guido's a 4-5 star dishThe rest of the menu is just a real small variety of burgers and thats about it, and I don't remember it standing out or anything. JUST GET THE NACHOSAs a bar, I came here and ordered a couple drinks and the waitress didn't know what a couple of them were so... yea.. I haven't been back to drink, but only to order dem nachos.", 
      "Uh... No. If I wanted to hang out on campus and be eyeballed by frat boys looking for a fight, I'd go to Joe's or some other place like that. The food sucks. I don't drink anything but beer, so that's okay. Not my kind of place, and that is not Guido's fault. Verified family man just heading out for a cold beer that's all.", 
      "I go to Guido's occasionally and always have a great time. \u00a0During the day it has a nice, laid-back atmosphere and is a great place to just sit and chill at the bar or watch football on the weekends. At night it gets more crowded and is a perfect place to grab drinks with friends or get some late night food. \u00a0 The food is fantastic for the price, especially the nachos! The martinis are also surprisingly good. Try the pumpkin martini; it is delicious and only $5!", 
      "This place seemed to be the fun college hang out bar. The place where the frat boys come to hang out and scan the ladies up and down. I, am not a frat boy. I did not come here to hit on ladies. I felt old here. Though the bartender was nice and offered some suggestions to my friend on where he could meet some ladies to hook up with. Mercifully, I got to go back to the hotel and get myself to bed.", 
      "guidos has really good french fries. REALLY REALLY GOOD. like sneak them off your husband's plate when he's in the bathroom even though you already have your own good......but remember all those people you hated in high-school? the ones you figured would join a fraternity or sorority to try and legitimize the fact that they are drunk, mentally disturbed, and semi-literate? remember how you thought they'd all still be acting like jack-asses in their thirties? well, you were right, and i promise you, they are hanging out at guidos right now with five hundred of their best friends.", 
      "Absolutely unimpressed.The frat boys yelling and carrying on Saturday nights when I'm walking past don't make for good advertisements, guys, especially when one shouts, \"Look at the fool with the fro\" and points. \u00a0ugh.Still, I decided to give Guido's a shot. \u00a0I went for dinner after studying one night with some friends.The waitress was polite but chronically forgetful, and had to be asked multiple times for anything from water to silverware to condiments. \u00a0The burger was...okay. \u00a0The fries were disappointing. \u00a0The crab cakes were dry and icky.I'm not coming back. \u00a0And I'm certainly having my headphones in each time I pass the ever scintillating crowd on the weekends.", 
      "While I had been to this place before and it was passable, I made the mistake of going on some \"Jose Cuervo\" day, when downtown Champaign was all blocked off. \u00a0Even worse, I took my family.Tiny, overpriced menu, with heated-up pulled pork on a grocery store bun. \u00a0Chips on the side. \u00a0More than $7. \u00a0My dad asked for a bottle of Miller Lite, they brought him a draft without checking if it was alright, and charged him for a bottle anyway. \u00a0Inattentive waitress, despite the place being full of workers, we were left waiting a long time for pretty much anything we wanted.Truly awful, I will never be there again. \u00a0Extorting your customers and ignoring their requests is not a good way to get repeat business.", 
      "Going a few more times since last review, I think that the banality that is this place drags it out of the 3 stars range. If friends suggest Guido's, which they often do, because it is a vanilla compromise place, I cringe. I still go along, but my heels drag on the way there, and my feet get itchy after half a beer.There are a million places just like Guido's on the North Side of Chicago, and I think that a high proportion of the patrons here represent next year's crop of Chads and LP Trixies. Guido's isn't 100% a Campustown bar, but its on the way. Teej T.'s observation re: the crowd is 100% accurate, and unfortunately asshats like this are more the rule than the exception. Food is pretty decent, prices a little on the high side for pub grub, but a good value for lunch. The place gets pretty crowded on Thurs-Sat nites, and the service gets understandably slow then. Good, but stingily-portioned onion ring sides. I say if you're gonna upcharge me for onion rings, I want a lot of 'em.Objectively, the place is 'fine' in a ho-hum way. Subjectively, the intangible anti-culture, anti-intellectualism, anti-anything that is novel, interesting, and unique in favor of everything that is popular, faux-hawked, slutty, and top-40 brings this place down a peg.", 
      "I don't go here for the nightlife, so I can't speak to this place as a bar. As a lunch place, though, it's fantastic. There is always a place to sit, the service is fast and friendly, and they have a great menu that leans slightly towards the southwest. Their southwestern quesadilla with the cajun chicken is amazing. I don't usually like things with corn, roasted or no, but the whole thing is delicious and not laden with grease. The grilled tortilla is flavorful, as is the side cup of southwestern sour cream they give you to dip each bite in. Other good eats are their onion rings, Cobb salad (and it's under $9--cheap by my book), and Buffalo chicken. Bottom line, I dig Guido's.", 
      "Uggh I think Guido's is my favorite bar in champaign. \u00a0The \"uggh\" is because my favorite place in champaign still has miller light girls wearing slutty referree outfits at football games. \u00a0I'm pretty sure they have the best bloody mary's in town, and their pineapple upside down cake martini is more or less killer-- as are all their specialty cocktails, for that matter. \u00a0Which is probably why if you go after 9PM, even if you are lucky enough to not have to stand in line, you almost definitely won't be able to get a table.", 
      "Cheap drink specials,no Effen, large space,odd crowd, big ass jager bombs!that's really all \u00a0I can say about this place.", 
      "3 stars for Guido's. \u00a0No more, no less.The menu is very limited. \u00a0I was surprised at how limited. \u00a0Maybe we were there at an off time where they were in between lunch and dinner and that's the bar menu, I'm not sure, but it was small.On our table:QuesoNachosTeriyaki chicken sandwichGrilled cheeseBoth sandwiches came with \"eggplant fries\" as an upcharge.The queso and nachos \"looked better than they tasted.\" \u00a0The grilled cheese was standard. \u00a0The teriyaki chicken sandwich was very salty and very dry.The eggplant fries stole the show. \u00a0They were delicious, with a side of grainy honey mustard for dipping. \u00a0They're probably the only thing I'd go back for.Also, if you want a cup of coffee (as my dad did) be aware that they use a Keurig, and therefore, charge by the cup. \u00a0No free refills on your joe.", 
      "I went here for a business meeting after a seminar. \u00a0It was about 5pm, and sure, it was raining, but the lights were turned down really low, ready for the night crowd (although it seemed a little early for night time lighting). \u00a0So I thought it was a little dark, but anyway...I had the bacon cheeseburger, and it was alright. \u00a0I'd give it an average rating. \u00a0You would think paying $8 for a bacon burger, they would put more than 2 skimpy slices of bacon on it. \u00a0The fries were good though. \u00a0They were the super skinny ones, sort of like Murphy's. \u00a0I did not check out their beer selection, not because it was a business meeting, but I had serious studying to do after wards, so I can't comment on that aspect. \u00a0I can see it being a good place for groups to go. \u00a0Not sure what the night crowd is like. \u00a0It's maybe a little fancy, but not required. \u00a0Like, if you wanted to \"go out\" and \"dress up\" you could probably go here, but if you were in jeans and a t-shirt that would be okay too. \u00a0Know what I mean?The waitress was nice, it has a large, open area, I think a pool table, and booths and tables along the perimeter. \u00a0And outdoor seating.", 
      "I like their decor, and I like their onion rings. \u00a0I also like that getting blue cheese is an option for the burgers.Other than that, I was just not impressed. \u00a0It was one of those non-busy times when there seem to be 10 bored waitresses milling around, but not one of them is actually helping you. \u00a0It seriously took 10 minutes between being seated and seeing our waitress. \u00a0Then our burger orders were mixed up. \u00a0Then we didn't see our waitress until it was time to leave. \u00a0It's also worth noting that while I may sometimes have the self-esteem and paranoia of a 13 year old emo girl, I really feel like the waitress was judging me.On a more food-related note, I was DEFINITELY unimpressed by the veggie burger. \u00a0It was over-spiced with chili powder, which made my choice of blue cheese crumbles unappetizing. \u00a0It seemed like it came out of a package, which could be true, but I've never had a bad Boca burger. \u00a0Definitely not worth it for the price.", 
      "Guido's is essentially all the douchebags from jersey shore in shitty champaign Illinois. The doorman (doesn't deserve to be called a bouncer) was an arrogant prick. Anyone who is visiting champaign, do not go here. You won't feel welcomed. I would have put 0 stars but Yelp is giving them the benefit of the doubt.", 
      "This is a relatively classy place, not necessarily a college bar. \u00a0At least, there was a fair mix of ages in here, and nobody even gave me dirty looks when I cheered vociferously for Penn State against the Illini during a Saturday-night game. \u00a0It was lively but not crowded.They have dark red paint and cherry wood in here, which individually are quite handsome but do not match well together. \u00a0In general, though, it's an attractive place with a mellow atmosphere. \u00a0One detraction: \u00a0the bathrooms are terrible, far worse than you would expect given the rest of the establishment. \u00a0Service was friendly and attentive from our two waitresses. \u00a0 The first one could not name the bar's whiskeys besides \"Jameson, Jack, Jim, Crown\" (thankfully I ended up with Woodford Reserve) but give her credit for at least knowing what \"whisk(e)y\" is (you'd be surprised).", 
      "Guido's is ok. Pros: great burgers (even the vege burger is good), awesome fish sandwich on Fridays, one of the best outdoor seating locations in Chambana... Perfect for a leisurely and/or boozy lunch in the sun.Cons: Downstairs club gets a bit rough later on in the night...sides (ESP fruit and veges) on sandwiches not always fresh and service can be slow.", 
      "What comes to mind when I think of Guido's? Three things:Nachos. Burgers. Want.Everything else about this place kinda fades into the background, for me at least. The decor and ambiance are nice enough, I suppose, though a bit on the dark side. But seriously - who cares?I'm there for the nachos anyway. These bad boys are listed under appetizer, but don't be fooled - the order is huuuuge and definitely could hold its own as an entree. If you're going to Guido's, get the nachos. End of story.", 
      "In general, I like Guidos. \u00a0They have a good selection of bottled beer, and it's reasonably priced. \u00a0I think their food is fine, I've taken my dad there before and we've definitely had worse meals in CU over the years. \u00a0Hell-- I even think that some of their martinis are better than those at Boltini-- blasphemy, right? \u00a0The bartenders have always been very nice, but I had one interaction with a waitress that was less than ideal-- I ordered La Fin du Monde, she brought me Lindeman's Framboise, I pointed out the error (they're polar opposites of the bottled alcohol spectrum, I didn't want to pay $8 for raspberry stuff) and she made a comment about how it's not like they could give it to someone else.. trend in DT champaign? But, she did bring me the right beer after I questioned her initial decision. \u00a0Overall, I like going there to play pool on the quiet nights... on the weekends, I'd rather go somewhere else.", 
      "Usually will get drug here with co-workers every now and then. \u00a0Very average, just passable food. \u00a0Typical greasy food type of fair. \u00a0 A bit on the higher side price wise I think. $10 for a sandwich and fries. \u00a0I hear at night the service, crowds can get pretty bad, but I've always went for lunch and generally the service/wait times were OK. \u00a0Yes, not good, just OK. \u00a0I would never go here if I had the choice, but if I was with a group and ended up here for food, I could probably find something to hold me over to my next meal without being too upset about it. \u00a0All and all, this place is average at best.", 
      "Just an average bar with slightly above average bar food. \u00a0It is a nice atmosphere with an island bar and big booths around the perimeter. \u00a0There is a nice patio outside as well. \u00a0The service can be slow and uniformed at times, but nothing all that bad.Food is pub grub. \u00a0Lots of burgers that are good. \u00a0A few other sandwiches and some apps as well. \u00a0Nothing is great, but certainly not bad. \u00a0Some Bell's and Goose Island on tap, but not much else on that front. \u00a0Nothing to go out of your way for, but a decent spot downtown.", 
      "Mediocre. The bar environment is okay in the evenings, and there's pool if you're into that sort of thing, but Jupiter's is better if you're looking for pool and food, and Esquire is better if you're looking for pool and booze. The bar looks okay, and drinks are priced reasonably, so there's that.My problem is the food. The chicken tenders are acceptable, if greasy, but the burger is indistinguishable from most other places in C-U. It's just so darn bland as a restaurant and a bar that it's not worth going to.", 
      "Service was good, and the place was big and clean. \u00a0They have so much competition in town, and the food was greatly lacking. Prices were not cheap for the lousy food my group had. I will not be back.", 
      "Me likey.If you're looking for a nice, off campus bar, I suggest Guido's. \u00a0It does get fairly crowded on weekend nights, but typically no line, and no cover, and the crowd that frequents this bar is fairly diverse. \u00a0They have a wide selection of beers and great food which makes this place a good spot for lunch or dinner as well. \u00a0The grilled chicken I got was really juicy and tasty - not the dry, flavorless, just out of the freezer stuff you'd usually find at other bars, and the nachos and quesadillas are yummy, cheesy, goodness.It's clean, spacious, great ambiance, and they have an outdoor patio for additional seating. \u00a0Guido's is a great place to take out of town friends for a good time.", 
      "I really like this place that I go nearly every weekend when I am in town. \u00a0They used to have really hot waitresses so my guy friends would make me go all the time. \u00a0There is no cover.. no lines.. \u00a0busy and it's a posh place to hang out on the weekends. \u00a0It's supposed to be a sports bar.. but it doesn't really have that feel. \u00a0The drinks are also decent.. it's not watered down and the prices are reasonable.I like some of their food too. \u00a0Best quesadillas in town. \u00a0Nachos are pretty good too. \u00a0Crab cakes are NOT good. \u00a0I'm not a huge fan of the sandwiches.. but the fish sandwich special on Friday is okay.", 
      "This isn't a bad place. It's nice on the inside, the booths are spacious, but the menu is severely limited. There's a handful of appetizers, a few salads, and the rest is sandwiches and burgers. Nothing on the menu really stands out as being that special. I got the Reuben sandwich and it was fine. The bonus was the eggplant fries, they were pretty good. There's a decent beer selection (mostly in bottles, with some on tap). With its apparent shortcomings I plan on going back. This is the kind of place I could see myself hanging out at and having a few beers before moving on to other places for the night.", 
      "First bar experience, so it was alright. Wasn't expecting a whole lot. Burgers are amazing though (a bit overpriced, but OMG their special mayonnaise is sooo good). The service isn't great - my friend got the wrong order and the waitress was like \"are you sure?\".", 
      "After always going to the bars on campus, this is certainly a change-up in downtown Champaign. A chill atmosphere, a lot more older people, townies. Just something different outside of the college town. It took forever to get our food, but I must say even with a very limited menu, the food was delicious. Typical greasy food, but the western burger was just really good.Surprisingly though the eggplant fries were amazingly delicious!. This was my first time trying eggplant fries, so good my friends and I had to get a second order! I would go here again, the prices aren't bad and the service could have been better, but when you're with people who make you laugh, it overshadows that. Go & try it out, even if it is just for the eggplant fries!", 
      "One nice thing about this place is that there's plenty of place to sit inside during the summertime. That's about the only good thing I can think of offhand. I had the eggplant sandwich with steamed veggies. The veggies were great. The eggplant sandwich was awful. Soggy, flavorless, just plain gross. A friend ordered a burger and was very unimpressed. Flavorless and cold. And another friend got fries that were limp and frigid. The server seemed overwhelmed. We had to ask for water refills multiple times. The server took the orders for most of our table but not all of it. When she finally came back, she had no clue she hadn't gotten all the orders. All in all, I'm not dying to go back here anytime soon.", 
      "The only way this place gets three stars is because the service was good and our food was good. My wife and i went there for lunch. I got the chicken salad and fries. She got a veggie sandwich and onion rings. My sandwich was good and hers was ok. They were what they were. No frills. The veggie sandwich was just a plain veggie sandwich. The reason this place needs less stars is because I would liken it to a TGI Friday's or Chili's. There is just nothing that would set it apart from standard American fare. I am glad I just went there for lunch rather than dropping more money at dinner.",

      "I have been here twice on a Monday afternoon around 4:30 having a beer and nachos. I think the nachos are really good. We have always had great service and it's never crowded (because of the time obviously). However, I am not that impressed with anything. Maybe I should try more items and then write a review. But, I also got a ticket while parked in the metered parking lot. I know it's my fault for miscalculating but it still pisses me off."

      "I keep getting the tofu stew with seafood (p13 b) and my fiance gets the spicy squid (s5). I am sure the other food is good because it smells and looks fabulous, but we cannot stop ordering these two amazing dishes over and over. Great korean side dishes, good service, great prices, Wonderful place.I'll take a star off because they don't send out the tables entrees together at all. Everything just comes out whenever.", 
      "like this place a lot. Good food and good service, and food is usually slow when they are busy, I tend to go at off peak hours and the food never let me down. Decent amount of side dishes, huge serving size.", 
      "Great food! Best Korean in town. Service can be slow but as expected. Owner is super friendly and personable.", 
      "This easily-overlooked Korean restaurant off-campus is unobtrusive, clean, and spacious. It's located on a nondescript strip mall on Neil, and unfortunately hard to get to without a car. \u00a0(Disclaimer: Not Korean) I have been here once, a long time ago, and twice in more recent memory. Both of these times, I have ordered the fried rice with tender beef, because it is honestly one of the best dishes of fried rice I have ever tasted. Whatever, I don't care that it probably isn't that authentic of a dish; I wish I could cook a batch of fried rice that good. There are many types of veggies cooked in with the dish, but they're mainly there for texture and flavor. It all ends up creating this fairly homogenous taste, but it doesn't matter, it's homogenous like a tub of butter pecan ice cream is homogenous; sure, there's no variation, but in the end, it still tastes really good and you're happy to eat more. \u00a0The rest of the menu is vast, containing foods that I don't know how to pronounce nor consume. Also, don't forget that they bring out six dishes of banchan, small accompaniments that go with your meal. All of this makes for a (seemingly) authentic experience that's pretty good for central Illinois. \u00a0The owner is a pretty animated guy, always staying busy at the counter, and keeping this place immaculately clean. He's a bit aloof, probably because his English isn't so good, but I'm sure he's a lot more chatty and helpful in Korean, and the same goes for another \u00a0waitress.", 
      "The service was a bit slow in the beginning, but once we ordered, it was better. We ordered a seafood pancake for the table, and for entrees we had bi bim bap, spicy cod stew, and chap chae. The pancake was okay- it tasted fine, but the seafood was bland and the pancake itself was mushy rather than crispy. The chap chae was also okay. The noodles were good, but it was very sweet and needed more vegetables. The bi bim bap is really good, and doesn't skimp on ingredients. I didn't try the stew, but it was well-received. Overall, I think it's good Korean food, but nothing spectacular.", 
      "I'm really disappointed in this place and will never be returning.I ordered the same dish every time I came for a few months - vegetarian bean curd bi bim bop. I always requested no egg, no meat, just vegetables. I also always place my order with the same man - who appears to be the owner or manager. The last time I went, \u00a0I decided to dine in with a friend and ordered bean curd bi bim bop. He asked me something after I said bean curd bi bim bop that I didn't quite understand. So I repeated to him, please just the bean curd, nothing else. I also pointed at the bean curd bi bim bop listing on the menu.When the food came out, I checked the dish and it had a pile of gray meat on top. I called the man over and politely said that I had ordered just bean curd. He became angry and almost shouted that I had ordered beef. I told him that I was sorry for the misunderstanding but I always order vegetarian - no meat - just bean curd. \u00a0He snatched the dish away and went to the counter where he began banging things around angrily.A minute later (obviously not enough time to re-fire a dish) a different server placed a bowl in front of me. \u00a0I searched through the food before eating and found more strips of gray meat throughout. Apparently, they had just scooped out the top of the same dish and served it to me again. I was incredibly embarrassed and disappointed. Based on the reaction I received from the manager/owner I did not expect that any further questions or complaints would be met in a productive way. We ended up paying our entire ticket (including the inedible bi bim bop) and promptly leaving to go get food somewhere else. Mistakes happen all the time, but the reaction I received at politely asking for the correct dish was abhorrent and not any way to run a restaurant. If you would like an enjoyable, pleasant meal without an irate and unreasonable staff, I would suggest going elsewhere.", 
      "Go with a girlfriend. Generally dishes are very classic and delicious. They hab two kinds of rice", 
      "If you are looking for a ton of opening small dishes, this is the place to go. The service and the rest of the food is mediocre and I would definitely recommend other Korean joints in town for specific things. I'm not Korean but from my korean friends this place is a more Authentic Korean place, but beats me, I thought the food here wasn't as good as say, Woorijib, Aririang, or Star Karaoke. This place definitely had the best side dishes though, they give like 6-8 of em and they will refill all of them for no charge", 
      "I am officially becoming a fan today. Before today, I usually have some soup dishes with chunks of meat and rice cake or noodles in it. Those are not my faves. But today, I had the sauteed sweet potato noodles with veggies and slices of beef, N1 in the menu. Thin round noodles (thicker than angel hair and clear) were sauteed and stirred fried very graciously with the slightly sweet and salty and greasy sauce. Beef slices bound into chunks but absorbed the sauce well. The Veggies were too thin-cut and too little. An improvement space there.Overall, 3.5 stars for the above and 5 stars for the seafood pancake (tons of green onions, if you can get pass with that).", 
      "Unlimited side dishes... that is alljk, but I haven't found that anywhere else on campus so it's a huge plus.The BBQ is not that good (got the bulgogi and it was horrible)but their regular dishes are good, (squid or octopus), pancakes, soon dobu, etc. I really like the staff, they're all super friendly and accommodating (once we came 30 mins before they were suppose to open but they just let us in anyways)", 
      "The food is a little bit expensive for students. The service is tooooo slow. Overall the food is okay.", 
      "The people there have mental problems! Seriously, I have never had more bizarre treatment by people in a restaurant. I ordered a dish that happened to have the rice separately; it was meant to be mixed with the other sauces and veggies and such. I have a rice allergy, so I was pleased as punch that it came separately so I could just avoid it. I'm used to doing that.The waitress saw me doing that -- not mixing everything with my rice -- and had a cow. She looked like she had just laid an egg and came clucking over to me and explaining that they had to be mixed, etc. I told her about my allergy and that I wasn't going to eat the rice. Her jaw literally dropped, and she ran away -- get this -- to bring the manager over so he could talk to me. I spent almost 10 entire minutes, completely embarrassed while my date sat across from me and tried to keep from laughing, listening to the manager and this waitress crowd around me and insist that it wouldn't taste right without the rice, I HAD to mix the rice, please mix the rice...oh. my. GOD. It's an allergy, people! When they finally went away, they sat a few tables away and literally just watched me eat the rest of the time until I left. What creepy people! No other Korean restaurant I've ever been has had such total weirdos; this place is just \"special\"!", 
      "Champaign is lucky to have multiple Korean restaurants but this one has the best food, ambiance and the only bathroom I would use!We had my daughter's birthday dinner two years in a row at this restaurant and they could not have been more gracious and accommodating. \u00a0 The steamed and fried dumplings were delicious and the bulgogi is my hands down favorite. \u00a0I recommend the multi grain rice, it has more flavor. \u00a0I am by no means an expert in Korean food but I sure know friendly and polite employees who work in a clean restaurant that serves tasty, fresh food. \u00a0Give it a try!", 
      "The food was delicious! I had this dish that was stir fried baby octopus beef and some thin rice noodles. It was so good! And they give you so many side dishes! I'm not a fan of yellow pickled radishes, but even those were edible here!! They also have 2 options for rice - white rice, or mixed rice which is rice and various grains and some beans mixed together!", 
      "I think this is the best place for Korean in town. \u00a0It is more expensive than campus.. but I think the food is a lot better and you get a lot more for the price. \u00a0Plus, free parking! \u00a0If you have never eaten Korean though, I would go with somebody so you're not totally overwhelmed by all the dish names.I like the seafood pancake (go for the half portion.. it's almost as large as the full), dolsot bimbimbop, and seafood jigae (a spicy soup).The service is a hit or miss. \u00a0One time I had to get my own water, utensils, and bill. \u00a0Other times.. the service is just fine.", 
      "B Won is a pretty good Korean place that's a bit more accessible than the ones on campus town. \u00a0(free parking!) \u00a0The atmosphere's spacious and the service was pretty attentive.Overall this place was solid and is definitely a good choice if campus town is ridiculously crowded or if you're simply not in the mood to pay for parking. \u00a0The bulgogi was above average, though it wasn't grilled. \u00a0That was sad. \u00a0However, it came with plenty of tasty sides and a bowl of miso soup. \u00a0It also came with a salad with a kim chee-esque vinegrette. \u00a0Sundobu jigae and Pa chun: \u00a0Nothing particularily special, but quite tasty.", 
      "Food was authentic and incredibly yummy. Lived in Seoul for two years. I've been back in the States for almost a year and had yet to try a Korean restaurant in the States. This place hit the spot. We ordered \u00a0the hae-mul pajeon (half order) and two orders of the galbi. The half order of pajeon was huge!So much food! It was heartbreaking to not be able to finish it. I drove an hour and some change just to eat at this place and was not disappointed. I can't wait to go back to try the seollangtang. The kimchi was also quite delish. Five yummy stars!", 
      "We went there for my friend's birthday tonight. It's my first time giving a reataurant a 1star. The food was over salty, however, that was not the worst part. The service is the worst in my life. The waitress kept giving us nasty looks and horrible attitudes, she yelled at at one of us for forgetting to sign the receipt. The waiter,waitress or even the boss were talking about us in korean. Maybe they thought we cannot see them pointing and laughing at us. At last, the waitress dropped the bill in front of us when we ate for only 15minutes. That was the worst experience in my life and i will never go there again. NOT Recommended!", 
      "I totally agree with helen H, I had the same dish and it was amazing. This is definitely my Korean restaurant of choice in C-U... clean, modern, incredibly and fast friendly service. The only downside is the menu being slightly confusing for someone who doesn't understand Korean, but I respect they don't 'dumb it down' too much! Prices are slightly higher than Campustown, but totally worth the $2 more.", 
      "Great food. \u00a0Everything was very tasty and well-prepared, especially my bulgogi... mmmm....Our server was awesome, gave us recommendations and kept close watch on our side dish levels, offering refills whenever we got low. \u00a0The manager happily offered us a whole bowl of candies when my dad asked for a second. \u00a0Very nice, clean, spartan (in a good way) atmosphere. Overall a winner!", 
      "3.5 stars B-Won seems to be my go-to Korean place now, but II don't think it's because of their food.I'm not a Korean food connoisseur. Apart from Bulgogi, I really don't know what to get. It seems like I just randomly get anything that's on a hot-plate at Korean restaurants. I've had an AMAZING Korean meal before and since then I've been trying to replicate that experience. No success though.So why B-Won over the 3 other Korean places on campus (4 if you count Spoon house)? Maybe it's simply because of the ambient. Even though the waiter spoke little English and wasn't able to offer any helpful recommendation, the overall ambient was much less chaotic than other Korean restaurants. The restaurant wasn't too loud to talk or too smoky too breathe. I don't know if the food is any better because I never seem to get the same dishes to compare, but the experience was more enjoyable.", 
      "Went to B Won for dinner for the first time last night and spent the entire day today going to the bathroom and feeling sick. I have an iron stomach and can't remember when was the last time I got sick from eating out (knock on wood). While I don't think I had serious food poisoning I do feel that the ingredients are not the freshest, the cooking oil is suspicious and the food is loaded with sodium (even more so than typical Korean food). The seafood pancake was a huge letdown. I couldn't find anything other than gigantic scallions in the thin and greasy pancakes. Last time I checked scallions were not considered to be seafood! Last time I had seafood pancake in New York, it was thick with crispy outer layer and FULLY loaded with identifiable seafood from shrimp to crab meat. What they serve here is a travesty. For entree, I had stir fry with baby squid and marinated steak. There were lesser tiny pieces of squid in the whole dish than all the tentacles on a baby squid. It was also the chewiest and most rubber like squid I have ever had in my life. Lucky, it was easy to pick them out since there were so few pieces. The beef was chewy as well. Like I had mentioned before, the dish was salty enough to require a side of blood pressure medication. All I can say about the service is that it was quick. A bit too quick for my liking. My bill came with my entree! Hello, at least let me pick out the squid first. I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately I will not be back.", 
      "If only Yelp do half a star...this would be a 3.5 star for me.Ok, the first time I went to this place with my sister, we tried the beef bulgogi which was cooked in this big pot right in front of you. That was a thumbs up. Along with the beef bulgogi we got soon dubu jjigae (spicy soup that has tofu in it), a salad, and 7...not 1 or 2... but 7 side dishes. That's pretty impressive. The side dishes were delicious. The beef was perfectly cooked at that time. I love how marinated sauce thickens by the time the meat was completely cooked, it has so much flavor to it and there's that hint of sweetness to it.Ok second time we visited, me and my sister ordered the same food cuz, well, we freakin love the first one that much. To my surprised, it was more of let-down. The beef was harder to chew, the sauce that comes with the beef was rather runny or liquidy compared to the thick yummilicious one, and the soup wasn't as warm as before and got cold pretty quick. At both times someone was cooking the bulgogi for us (We just don't know how to do it.. or I guess we're just spoiled lol) and by the same person. The people were really nice though, very nice. I just didn't like the food the second time around. Am I going to this place again? Why not. I've only tasted one dish and I want to try others. This would've been easily a 4 if the food was prepared the same way as before. Consistency is important.", 
      "The food is fine, but the service sucks. We came for a late lunch, and there were only two tables including us. The guy (I believed it's the owner) came to our table several times just standing and staring at us while we are still looking at the menu, which was so creepy. I told him we needed more time to decide but it looked like he didn't understand me and came by again before we were ready to order. I felt like being rushed to order.Then the food came, and they were fine. But the bill came when we were in half eating, and the guy just dropped the bill on our table saying nothing. That was sooooooo RUDE.", 
      "B-Won is a magical place in C-U. Its a special, one of a kind, restaurant that is run locally and I hope never goes away. It means to me what the Ribeye must mean to generations past.Anyway, the Menu can be hard to get into, but the staff is over the top friendly they will help you with anything you want to know. \u00a0I have seen a lot of reviews saying the service was terrible, but in my multiple times have no experienced it. The owned is usually there and they are very welcoming to kids, which is sometimes tough to find.The Bi-Um-Bop is by far my recommendation. It comes in a hot pot with an egg on top, and has great veggies in it. The Rice cooks to the bottom of the pot making this fantastic, crunchy texture to the meal. The sauce they provide is amazing, but spicy so add at your own level of tolerance. Other great dishes include: Spicy Octopus, Bulgogi, Chop Cha.", 
      "Never come on Friday night. There is an hour wait for food. And they won't tell you you may have to wait before you place your order.", 
      "Is the food good? Yes. Is the service? Fast for large groups but these people are RUDE. I've heard of them making fun of fat people. They also cracked jokes about my friend and I when we were there. When I was outside parking my bike, the owner GLARED at me while I locked it. Unprofessional and crude service here. I can take my service elsewhere, thank you.", 
      "Food is pretty good, but major problem with service. When we dined there, it was severely understaffed; only 4 workers were working the floor, covering all the tables. Some dishes needed to be cooked at the tables so that further limited the service. We had to wait 20+ minutes after sitting down before ordering.Serving sizes were generous but they were very stingy on the rice. When we asked for more, the waiter let out a large exasperated sigh before complying. Quite unprofessional. When we asked for more water, again with the exasperated sigh. So sorry for inconveniencing you! We ordered our dishes with white rice, but when our food was brought out, we got red rice instead. We told them we ordered white, but they said that they were out and red was all they had and left it at that.You have the option of having meat grilled at your table on a portable stove, which is nice, but after they brought the stove out and lit the fire and poured oil in the pan, they left for around 15 minutes. In addition to the increasingly hot oil that was sitting right in front of us, the pan was leaking oil over the open fire and the table. When this was brought up, they brushed it off saying it was okay. They never cleaned up the oil on our table.After we finished our meal, we waited quite a while for our check. Eventually, we were fed up with waiting and we got up to go get someone to bring us the check. When the check arrived, we quickly threw in our credit cards and set it to the side of the table (cards sticking out, easily visible) and proceeded to wait another 15 minutes before they came back to pick up the check. After that it was a good 20 minutes before we got our cards back.TL;DR Food is good, but service is atrocious.", 
      "Best Korean food in cu. period. never had a problem with service.It's a family restaurant, don't expect service like that at a frickin tgi-Fridays!!!!", 
      "The food is very good. The price is right. The wait is dreadful. Seriously, 1 hour for the first entr\u00e9e?!? \u00a0Really? 3 minutes for next entr\u00e9e, then 20 minutes more for the third and fourth entrees for our group of four. \u00a0 Unbelievable. One of our party knew folks working there, or we would have left. \u00a0Just too slow. \u00a0Oh, and they ran out of the dumpling appetizers. And we found that out 40 minutes into our wait.", 
      "Best Korean restaurant near campus!clean, delicious, kindclose to real Korean traditional food", 
      "This place is great. I really didn't expect too much when I decided to give it a try for dinner, first because I've had some disappointing experiences with Korean food in the past, and second because of its weird location outside of town and tucked between the train track and a GM dealership. I got there at around 9pm (which is late for getting dinner on a weekday in Champaign), and surprisingly enough the place was quite happening (it wasn't nearly full, there were a good dozen of people or so). The interior is a little bare, but it's clean, modern and well lit. The menu selection is extensive, and while I'm by no means a connoisseur of Korean food, they seemed to offer a lot of pretty typical dishes. I ordered the stir-fried squid in spicy sauce (see picture... I love squid and will order it whenever I can, which is surprising considering I wouldn't even consider eating it just a few years ago... but I digress), and it was pretty good. The squid was just a tiny little bit too tough, and this could have been expected considering the distance to the nearest ocean(!), but it was still very good. And not to forget: this little side dishes were plentiful and delicious (again see picture), and it also came with a bowl of rice and soup... I'm happy I didn't order any appetizer, which I was considering doing upon getting there, because that plenty of food already. All of that for a very reasonable price ($10.50). Sure, this may not be the best Korean food I've had, but it was still very good, filling and relatively cheap... how much more does one really need?... \u00a04-1/2 stars.", 
      "Given the size of Champaign-Urbana, I was quite surprised by the number of Korean restaurants in this town. \u00a0I have had generally good experiences at each one, but B Won is by far my favorite, especially as it is the best option for more formal dinners.B Won radiates with casual elegance unlike the other Korean restaurants here, which feel more like sweaty lunch spots for strung-out college students. \u00a0The real benefit of this building's high ceilings and good ventilation is that you don't feel like you're sitting in the characteristic smoke clouds found at most Korean restaurants (delicious, delicious barbecue smoke clouds--but, smoke clouds nonetheless).The sophistication of B Won is also reflected in a menu that is both diverse and interesting. \u00a0They have all the standards, like bulgolgi, jiggae, and bibimbap, but they really separate themselves from other Korean places in the variety of noodles, soups, and casseroles they serve. \u00a0Each item in the menu is given a description of the full complement of the dish's ingredients, which can be helpful for diners unfamiliar with Korean cuisine--and reading about ingredients like bellflower root and sweet potato noodles just makes you feel like you'll be enjoying an exotic meal. \u00a0During the winter, I love to eat their soups made of beef bones, which are always filling and well-seasoned. \u00a0I also have to pay compliments to the kimchi, which really stands out among the side dishes for me. \u00a0I usually overlook the nappa kimchi in favor of other dishes that I prefer, but at B Won, the kimchi has what I would describe as a very distinctive, carbon-y (think soda fizz) sensation in the mouth.Lastly, I want to address comments from other reviewers about the behavior of the owner and wait staff. \u00a0Although I'll admit that the waiters seem a bit socially inappropriate (by American standards), my own experiences give me the impression that their actions are mainly innocuous and can be attributed to cultural differences. \u00a0My experiences aren't intended to dismiss the feelings of obvious discomfort felt by other patrons; I'm just merely trying to cast a more humorous, silly light on the situation. \u00a0One time, I went with friends and we all ordered entrees. \u00a0The waiter asked if we wanted white rice or mixed rice (a blend made of several types of rice, grains, and beans). \u00a0My friend asked, \"What's mixed rice?\" \u00a0We saw the waiter struggle for an English description: \"It's, uh...well...it's...it's...it's good. \u00a0Yeah, it's good.\" \u00a0We had a laugh and just ordered the mixed rice, given his recommendation that it was good. \u00a0Another time, we had just finished a meal and received our check, which comes with pieces of corn-flavored candy. \u00a0My friends were weirded-out by the flavor and didn't eat their candy, much to the chagrin of the waiter when he returned to our table. \u00a0He asked why they weren't eating it (rejection of food is considered pretty rude in Asian culture), but I quickly picked up the candy and said, \"You don't want it? \u00a0I'll eat it then.\" \u00a0That seemed to resolve the whole situation, as the waiter hurried back with our change and more pieces of corn candy for me.", 
      "the amount of food and the quality is ok for the price. \u00a0the interior is large, clean, and can accomodate large groups. \u00a0BUTi was also there at 8:30 and was made to order before i even sat down. \u00a0the waiter made me feel like if i didn't order right that second i wouldn't be able to eat at all. \u00a0we were in a large group and gave them a lot of business, so i think they should have been a little more accommodating as far as giving us some time to think about what we wanted to eat. \u00a0i was also told to order from the very limited menu b/c anything else would take too long to cook. \u00a0then we saw everyone who ordered off the regular menu get their food waaaay before we did. \u00a0we ordered 5 orders of the bul go gi and 1 order of the seafood bul go gi. \u00a0they decided to lump in that 5th order of regular bul go gi in with the seafood one b/c they didn't feel like cooking that one separately. \u00a0they didn't even ask us first if that was ok. \u00a0just really careless service.", 
      "I went to this place \u00a0because my best friend( who is native Korean) told me the dishes here were alike ones in Korea. Since then, I become a regular guest. The food are tasty and the owner is very friendly. I would recommend order something from \"drinker's choices\".", 
      "On campus, I go to Woori Jib for a quick bolgogi at the office. Otherwise, I go to B-Won. I'm not a student, so the slightly higher prices aren't a bother to me. The food is consistently great, and my friends and I haven't had any trouble with the wait staff (some of them are even regularly entertaining!). The manager/owner is also super indulgent of cute toddlers (my friends', not mine) and long-winded customers (we've often sat and chatted for hours and hours there).", 
      "I liked this place. They made my dolsot bi bim bap correctly. Unlike alot of places, they actually heat up the pot right. It's supposed to go up to a really high temperature so that the rice on the edges will become crispy and slightly burnt. This is the best part of bi bim bap... and they did it perfectly.", 
      "Unlike other Korean restaurants in Chambana, B Won's interior looks more upscale and clean. Their prices are a little higher as well and they have the same menu for lunch or dinner. I tried their Dolsot Bi Bim Bap and it was very good but it was just a tad too pricey for students on a budget. I'd stick to the Korean restaurants in Campustown.", 
      "I'm so annoyed. \u00a0We got there at 8:30 and he rushed us to order. \u00a0I didn't even get to see the menu. \u00a0He only told us that the grilled food was available even though we saw other tables come in and got other foods. \u00a0I mean, if you're going to open a business, just keep your restaurant open a little longer. \u00a0Don't rush people to order, it's just poor customer service. \u00a0And who freaking closes a kitchen at 8:30 for pete's sake. \u00a0The prices are a rip-off especially since it's in a college town. \u00a0They said they didn't have any more pan chan after we requested more. \u00a0There's other Korean restaurants and closer to campus, I would totally skip this place!!", 
      "Decor and service are nice, but food tastes either bland (like the bibimbap) or awkward (like the fried rice), depending on what you order. Even though I've been dragged here many times, the menu is extremely extensive, so if you're into Korean cuisine this place might be worth a try. It's just that, if the flavor of B-Won food is an acquired taste, I never got it even after repeat visits."

      "I am yet to meet somebody who doesn't LOVE Black Dog Smoke & Ale House. This little hole in the wall packs genuine barbeque cuisine unlike anywhere in the vicinity of C-U. Yes, you may have heard it's a small restaurant with a perpetually long wait, but it's worth walking around adorable downtown Urbana for awhile before you're seated. I've also done a carry-out with several other people which only took about 25 minutes to prepare.There's a variety of BBQ sauces from mild to hot listed and detailed on the menu. My personal favorite is the Texas Sauce; it has that smoky flavor I expect out of Midwestern Barbeque. Also, you haven't really lived until you've tried the brisket sandwich.As for side dishes, my friends and I swear by the Twice Baked Potato Casserole. The sweet potato fries are irresistibly sweet and caramelized. Overall, Black Dog provides a one of a kind cuisine. Also VEGETARIANS-- there are some delicious options for you, too.", 
      "Why I haven't reviewed this place sooner is a mystery to me. Downtown Urbana has become a much better place since the opening of Black Dog. BD has become one of my regular dinner spots, their meals hardly ever disappoint. The only drawback is the waiting, sometimes you stroll right in and get seated, other times, it's an hour wait. The wait staff is very hit or miss, I have a few favorite waiters (yup, guys) and one waitress that I think are helpful, attentive, and funny. What to eat: Appetizers: smoked chicken wings, smoked artichoke dip (AMAZING!) Meats: anything pork (seriously), smoked chicken (I MUST try their brisket)Sides: fries, beans, slaw, twice baked potato casserole (I must try their sweet potato fries)Meh: Cuban sandwich -- while it's the best one in town, I was a bit disappointed in its size and it's good, but not excellent. That said, I might give it a second try.Misses: Chicken salad (new) and their very popular corn bread (sorry, it's all of that meat in it, for some reason I just can't like it!)I was just there this past Tuesday and am already planning my return. 4/5 stars because of the long waiting, running out of food quickly (though who can blame the hoards of hungry customers?!), and the hit-or-miss wait staff-I HIGHLY recommend this place the food is excellent, the drinks are good, and the prices are very fair", 
      "Good BBQ, but it didn't really 'wow' me. Possibly it's because I didn't get the burnt ends, but they were out of that by the time I strolled in on a Saturday night. Wasn't too long of a wait for me, only about 2 couples ahead of me and the gf. Got seated at the bar and had an unfriendly waitress. She just seemed stressed and unhappy. Heard her say to another table that it was a long day, so tried not to bother her with anything. I waited until she left and asked another waitress for a different bbq sauce with my meal ha. Anyway, I ordered the rib tips since they guy next to me got it and it looked delicious. It was alright, nothing crazy. I got one of the vinegar bbq sauces first and didn't like it at all. That's when I got the Georgia one which was a lot better and thicker. The twice baked potato casserole, I think it was called, was delicious. The potato salad was meh, you could probably skip on that. The gf got the chicken salad which came with a bunch of crackers. It was a different style on chicken salad so not really sure what to compare it too. It was alright though. We also split some corn bread and that was meh too. I think it was over hyped in my mind from some of these other reviews. Over all it was alright, wasn't too expensive either and you get a pretty decent amount of food. Had to take some home since there was so much so that's always a positive. One day I'll try those burnt ends....one day....", 
      "Mmmmmm soooo good. I went here for the first time last week. This place gets packed as the doors open. There isn't a lot of seating here. You might have to wait an hour for your food but it is worth the wait. If you like pulled pork or good food you should come here. The sweet potato fries are one of the best I have had, and the bbq sauces are good. I was not a fan of the beans, they had too much of a smokey flavor. The sweet tea was on point. The waitress was really friendly and interacted well with all the customers. For such a busy place they do a great job with customer service. Everyone in the area needs to experience this place at least once in their lifetime.", 
      "Best. Corn. Bread. Ever. If your mama ain't around slap someone else. Rib tips are sublime. Digging into my Burnt Ends now. Coleslaw was meh. Everything else was worth the wait.", 
      "This restaurant is a MUST if you are in the Champaign/Urbana area.The food, the drink, and the service are all WONDERFUL. I ordered the brisket and catfish as my proteins and beans and cornbread as my sides. The brisket and beans were my favorite food items: the brisket was smokey and moist and the beans were moderately spicy and were made with drippings from the brisket, YUM! The catfish was nothing to write home about but with the flight of sauces that I ordered I was able to pair it up with a sauce that made it more interesting (favorite sauces were the Georgia Peach, Texas BBQ, and Carolina vinegar). I also ordered the top-shelf bourbon flight which had the best bourbon I've ever tasted, 20 year Pappy Van Winkle! The pours were large which was a pleasant surprise for a top-shelf flight, much appreciated.As far as service goes, I have never had such a welcoming, fun-loving, and informed server as I did at Black Dog. Everyone at the place made our 8 top feel like they were happy we were there and wanted us to love everything we ate, and we most certainly did. I will definitely be back, again and again and again.", 
      "I adore Black Dog. If not for the health concerns, I would have eaten here every week when I was on campus. I would definitely go for the burnt ends, but they sell like hot cakes, so make sure you get there early or order ahead of time.I was interviewing the owner and staff for an article, and everyone was beyond passionate about their food. As I was taken back to see the smoking rack, I was happy to see the staff joking and laughing with each other. They seemed so at ease and seemed to enjoy their work. From the bartenders to the wait staff to the chefs, everything is bar none here. It shows in the quality of the bbq and the excellent drink recommendations made.I've seen people get the whiskey fleet and be awed by the beautiful presentation. Plus, there's nothing better than a spot of whiskey, burnt ends, pulled pork, mashed potatoes and some sweet potato fries. Better hit the gym afterwards, but you know it'll be worth it.", 
      "Black dog is seriously worth the wait. I came during lunch on a weekend and had a 30-40 minute wait, but the food came out quite quickly and the staff are so nice that it didn't matter.I ordered the brisket sandwich, slaw on the side with cornbread. I don't think I could've ordered anything better because I was in actual BBQ heaven. While I wanted to get the burnt ends I was unfortunately out of luck as they had already sold out - I have heard rave reviews from all my die-hard friends and one day I will get my hands on those meaty bits of goodness. For those that are looking to drink, they have a pretty diverse selection of beer to choose from, and it's constantly changing. I got the Green Flash double stout which I'd definitely recommend if it's still on the menu! A++ BD.", 
      "Aside from the AMAZING rib tips, the drinks were fantastic. We asked the bartender to \"surprise us\", and he definitely did. A margarita on the rocks with jalapeno tequila...best drink I've ever had.", 
      "Came at 5:30pm the Friday of homecoming \u00a0seeking and was sat by 6. Have a great seat by the window, a little breezy with the door, but get to look down the restaurant and outside. \u00a0Fun watching people write their names on the sign in board. \u00a0It was nice that we could have a drink while we waiting outside. \u00a0We were also able to look at menus while we waited so we didn't lose time. \u00a0We were able to order as soon as we were seated.First they have a great selection of hard ciders. \u00a0So for the non-beer drinker I can say hurray! First round for appetizer we had the cornbread...oh yeah delicious. \u00a0There were 3 of us doing the geometry to divide it up so we each got the same amount. \u00a0If we didn't have a ton of other food coming we would have ordered another.I had the pulled pork with the special chipotle slaw, baked beans, twice baked casserole. \u00a0OMG the chipotle slaw was so good on the pork that I ordered another side so I could finish my pork with it. \u00a0The smoke in the beans is no joke. \u00a0I mean they need to bottle and sell this. \u00a0I could eat it all the time. \u00a0So good I mixed it into the already amazing twice baked potato casserole. \u00a0Heaven! Mom had the beef brisket with chipotle slaw with twice bake casserole. \u00a0Needless to say, it was eaten with enjoyment.! The brisket just melted in the mouth. \u00a0And she was so happy when I ordered more of the chipotle slaw, it also complemented the brisket quite nicely.Dad had ribs, brisket, and polish sausage with the special side of green beans and smoked sweet potato. As with the rest of the meal yum! \u00a0The ribs fell of the bone. \u00a0And the pairing of the sausage and the Texas sauce was perfect.I just never had a bad bite. \u00a0In fact we enjoyed our meal so much that my mom is even considering we come back tomorrow night in our way back out of town.If you are in Urbana you MUST eat here!", 
      "Winner, winner, BBQ dinner!? Yes! TL;DR Quality BBQ here and easily one of the best places to eat in CU area.We signed in our group of 5 at 3:30 and were seated at 4 on a Saturday, get there early!My family are sort of BBQ fanatics, we had to try 3 different places in Memphis last time we were down, so seeing Black Dog rated highly on Yelp, we had to go when they came down to visit!Most of us had some variety of beef brisket while my grandmother also got ribs and my grandfather the chicken.We thought the brisket was tender and flavorful and not overly fatty. We tried some of the ribs too and really liked them! Very thick and meaty rather than fall-off-the bone style, which some people prefer. My grandfather said the chicken was good, but he did not like the side of cornbread that came with it. A traditional southerner, this cornbread was more muffin-style and too sweet for his preferences (I thought it was good). We also did like the twice baked casserole, French fries and sweet potato fries that were on the side, as well as the slaw that was on our sandwiches.Service was good but at the end a little slow to take our check due to a shift change, not a big deal!Now come my only 2 complaints. Complaint #1 would have to be that Black Dog is pretty stingy with their sauces. What came on the sandwiches was hardly anything, probably less than your average BBQ eater would like. We tried 3 different sauces I believe the hot peach, Texas and one other one, they all appeared to be good but I really cant provide an accurate taste test because we had so little of it! We also did not want to pay an extra $0.25 for extra, although my father did anyway because he's a sauce maniac! My other complaint is that the portion size was probably smaller than most BBQ places for the price. Our sandwiches were $9 and they came with one side which varied in size based on what we got. I had the casserole which was just a little cup, whereas my mom had a decent portion of sweet potato fries. I didn't leave hungry but I would probably get the combo or platter next time!Overall Black Dog has really great food for its location and I really like how I don't have to go to Memphis to get similar quality BBQ. It's nice to know that there is a local place that is very successful and also with great food and beer to go along with it.I'll definitely be back!", 
      "Good in every imaginable way.", 
      "Amazing BBQ! Friends recommended we stop here on a road trip. They did not steer us wrong!I had no idea how good Illinois BBQ could be. The meats, especially the burnt ends, were succulent and smoky. You don't even need the sauce. We also got the mustard sauce and the Carolina red sauce. Both were mouthwateringly good. We were also pleased by how great the slaw and side salad were. The greens were organic, local and fresh, and the vinaigrette dressing was delicious. It's not every day you go to a BBQ place with great salad.Service was perfect. Such a nice waiter.", 
      "You've gotta come check out Black Dog! They're usually packed, so be sure to come in early! This is definitely one of the better BBQ I've had. The corn bread here is ridiculously good. Be sure to try some of that. Just be careful as it's addicting! I've always found myself buying extra so I can bring it home!Anyways, I always get a sampler of everything there. The brisket and ribs are definitely my favorites there. You can't go wrong with that.They also have some amazing service. From the moment I walked in, there was a guy (forgot his name) that was very inviting and with a great sense of humor. Wish I can go back, but I'm back in LA!", 
      "Wonderful meal! Came here with our toddler after seeing a game at UIUC at about 9:00. Wait staff is phenomenal. They were out of many things, but we were prepared for this thanks to other Yelpers. What we were able to get was PHENOMENAL. Had the flight of sauces and we were very impressed. We rarely go to a BBQ place and like all of their different sauces, but Black Dog has hit a home run with each and every one! Our favs were the mustard, Texas BBQ, Carolina red and Lexington dip. Brisket was awesome. The vinaigrette they make for the salads is super. And they had a great beer menu.We loved it and will definitely be making an excuse to do the 2.5 hour drive again!The only thing we wouldn't get again was the cornbread because it was very salty. But if you're a first-timer, you need to try it because it's so different!We loved it.", 
      "Worth the wait every time! \u00a0Brought visitors from Chicago and they said it beats anywhere in Chicago. \u00a0Cannot wait for the new place. \u00a0Hope they keep doing what they do now.", 
      "Definitely recommend if you are in the area it's s real hole in the wall you better get here early though it gets busy! But the bbq is top notch! Try the burnt ends and ribs!", 
      "Best bbq in champaign Urbana area. A long line. I love ribs and burger. Bun ends are great.", 
      "Excellent, love this little quaint place. \u00a0This was my first time and I fell totally in love with this place. \u00a0It fills up fast but is worth the wait. \u00a0Their food was excellent. \u00a0I had the brisket.....best brisket ever!!! \u00a0I also had the corn bread....wonderful. \u00a0A must if u are in the area. \u00a0Too bad I'm over a hundred miles away.", 
      "The lines to get in are almost always long, which tells you something about the food. The burnt ends are out of this world, if you can get them. They make two batches a day. I think they are done at noon and 5 pm and they go pretty fast, for good reason.", 
      "When I travel, I like to find the small local places in the hopes of discovering a gem and I found one tonight. I had the smoked catfish because 4 other items (brisket, burnt ends, ribs, and something else) were sold out, but it was right up my alley. The corn bread was absolutely awesome. Get there early if you want to full menu but be prepared to wait. They also have a wonderful beer selection to go along with your meal. The bartender seemed a little grouchy when I first arrived, but heck, \u00a0I am most of the time too, and I don't require much attention anyways. I will definitely be back and a BIG THANK YOU for a wonderful meal.", 
      "Didnt live up the hype for me.", 
      "Black Dog is a staple of Champaign-Urbana by now. Coming from Texas, I didn't expect to find great BBQ, especially in Urbana, but I'm so glad I was wrong. The food here is fantastic and I recommend waiting out the long line to eat. It's well worth it. I highly recommend the Texas caviar as an appetizer. If I didn't care about my waistline I would order it every time. The burnt ends are good - there's a reason they sell out like crazy - but I don't think they're the best value for your money. I usually get the hot polish and brisket with the twice baked potato casserole and baked beans. The fries are also great, but I LOVE the potato casserole. You're missing out if you don't get it. My boyfriend loves the rib tips. I think they're the best value for your money, but I get annoyed putting that much effort into eating ;-)The sweet tea isn't great. I wouldn't order it if you're looking for legit sweet tea. The Carolina red sauce is my favorite. Black Dog switched their default sauce from that to the Lexington something other. Not sure why because I think the new default sauce isn't great at all. The Georgia peach is also good, but of you don't like sweet sauce stick with the Carolina. I will definitely miss Black Dog after leaving Champaign.", 
      "Great bbq joint. You can't ask for better service. I can honestly say that if you ordered an appetizer, it may come after your meal. \u00a0Or just force them to not give you your food right away. \u00a0We ordered and in less than a minute our food was on the table. I compliment our waiter for messing up our order and bringing us the wrong side because he ended up bringing us the side that we actually ordered and let us keep the other. \u00a0That was deserving of generous tip for the nice fellow. Great BBQ, Better Service.", 
      "Simply awesome. Incredible BBQ. Fantastic specials. Great drink selection. CANNOT GO WRONG. The biggest downside is the wait (often 30+ minutes). \\When you get there you write your name down on butcher paper and it is your job to know where you are on the list. You can't call ahead to make a reservation and they won't seat your till everyone in your party is there. But if you can get a seat you will not be disappointed. DONT leave champaign/urbana without having tried Black Dog", 
      "Superb BBQ! \u00a0They have daily specials, but they also run out of certain items by lunchtime. \u00a0Speaking of lunchtime, be ready for a ~15 minute wait, even for a party of 2-3. \u00a0Once you're seated, the service is good, and the aforementioned BBQ makes it worth the wait. \u00a0I spotted a solid selection of craft beer; I'll have to come back for dinner.", 
      "This place is GOOD. As in, \"I don't eat meat but I eat BBQ at Black Dog\" good. I've been a \u00a0\"peskaterian/vegetarian\" for over 4 years but upon a recent trip down south decided to indulge in some good ol' southern BBQ, and well... I'm a little lax in the meat eating department now. At least when it comes quality, well cooked, BBQ. You wont see me scarfing down a McRib, or eating meat anywhere else for that matter but give me some Black Dog pulled pork and I'll make an exception. You walk in and write your name and party number on the sheet. I've been here twice now and it was spot on both times. You'll have to wait a little unless you get take out but it's worth it.They have different specials each night and tend to run out of stuff so go early if you have your heart set on the burnt ends (I've yet to try them because they were sold out both times). \u00a0First time I got the 1/2 rack of ribs with mac & cheese, and coleslaw.Second time they only had 1/4 rack of ribs so I got the pick two with the pulled pork, coleslaw, and baked beans. Pulled pork was amazing! Tender and smokey, and full of flavor. That will be my go to order now. Mac and cheese is indulgent and delicious, coleslaw is of the vinegar (not creamy) variety which I love. Baked beans (they call them something else) were good, but too heavy for me personally. I'd eat them again though. The ribs were my favorite until I tried the pulled pork. They're still a close second.I could be a good vegetarian and the get the portabello sandwich with fresh chevre and roasted red pepper that sounds amazing, and maybe I will one day when my conscience overcomes me. But there's something for everyone there, so non-meat eaters will be just as satisfied I'm sure.", 
      "I was in town for business and the Black Dog was suggested by some of the locals. I ended up going two nights in a row. The first night I had the hot Polish sausage and the catfish. I'm not normally much of a fish eater, but it was so good I ended up having the catfish the second night as well, along with the brisket. The meats were perfectly cooked and so smoky and juicy that you really didn't need the sauces for either the flavor or moisture, although their sauces could have a review of their own. For the sides, I tried the smoked sweet potato, the cornbread, and the pit baked beans. \u00a0I'm always looking for baked beans with great flavor and most of the time I'm disappointed with sweet flavored beans that taste like they've come from the store. Black Dog's beans are the best I've had anywhere and I would go back just for the beans alone. \u00a0 The smoky cornbread was exceptional, and the smoked sweet potato with just a touch of butter and brown sugar was amazing. Whenever I visit the Champaign-Urbana area (and by area I mean anywhere within a hundred miles!), the Black Dog will be my first stop for dinner.", 
      "Average meat, creative and tasty sides, disappointing sauces. I was impressed that they pack the place as soon as the doors open and start a waiting list. The meat was what I would expect from a BBQ place but without a good sauce I was disappointed. I tried 3 and didn't like any of them.", 
      "Might be the best BBQ joint in the Central Illinois area.Having relocated to Kansas City, the BBQ capital of the nation, and eating Oklahoma Joe's on a regular basis, Black Dogs would be a HUGE competitor in the KC area. It's a close 2 or 3 in my BBQ book (OK Joe's being number 1). For just being in a college town, I wish this restaurant got more publicity because their recipe is ROCK solid. I miss it every time I'm thinking of visiting my Alma Mater.Their ribs and burnt ends are my favorite. I like my meat fatty, and these meats are marbled well, and smoked well. The corn bread is also phenomenal. It's pretty big (I usually split with one other person). Lastly the sauce: everyone I've tried is true to its name. Try Carolina Red for a kick or Georgia Peach for some sweet sauce.", 
      "Burnt ends and rib tips are to crave for! Go early to queue. Their cornbread has some pulled pork inside and it tastes nice!", 
      "This place is goood!The meat is always fresh and tender and cooked just right. Everything I've ordered there, on multiple occasions, has been spot on and smoked just right. It's pretty interesting to see such a place in tiny downtown Champaign. The place looks and smells awesome too. Once you enter into the tiny grunge-designed restaurant, the smokey smell of meats will serve as an early indication that you've come to the right place. The only issue with Black Dog is the wait. It's such a tiny place that if you go there at most times of the day, you will have to wait a good deal for your table. I had to sometimes resort to ordering out; however, when you're not in too much of a hurry, the ambience will convince you to stick around.", 
      "I hit Black Dog on the rave recommendations of several friends. \u00a0They speak the truth. \u00a0Black Dog is the bomb.*When you show up, you'll notice the place is packed. \u00a0Walk up to the slab of paper, grab a sharpie and write your name down. \u00a0You'll be called when there's room for you to begin your BBQuest.A sign near the entryway notified us they were out of burnt ends and mac 'n' cheese. \u00a0We mourned this loss and regrouped in time to be seated.Let's start with the cornbread. \u00a0You can order it as a side to your main dish or as an appetizer. \u00a0The appetizer portion ($2.95) is solid enough for two people. \u00a0The cornbread contains green chiles, pit beans, cheese and pulled pork. \u00a0Boom. \u00a0Regular bread is forever ruined.If you like sauces, Black Dog allows you to order a flight of all eight of theirs for just $2. \u00a0Milo's Mustard and Carolina Red were my favorite.For my main dish, I went with a 3 meat combo. \u00a0Ribs, chicken and brisket. \u00a0Chicken was my favorite. \u00a0Succulent, soft and juicy, it paired very nicely with any sauce, but it was a home run with the mustard.The ribs were appropriately soft and smoky. \u00a0I really loved these with the Carolina Red sauce.The brisket was good, but not particularly outstanding.I live in Chicago, but Black Dog is good enough to merit a two and a half hour drive. \u00a0If you're in the area, you have to check out this temple of meat!* Saying things are \"the bomb\" was a popular expression in the early 2000s. \u00a0Despite its rapid decline in coolness, some people still use it earnestly. \u00a0Others use it ironically. \u00a0You are free to decide the context in this review.", 
      "Here we go again. The best part about work travel is they pick up the tab!Anyhow... By looking at the exterior of this place I would have never guessed it to harbor a BBQ-haven within. I arrived in on a rainy early afternoon and was surprised to see still a bit of a crowd. In hindsight, this is probably a sign that the Urbana folk love this place- and warranted.I was promptly seated at the bar and happy to see that they have an EXPANSIVE option of bourbon and rye to choose from; even some high quality stuff like Bookers. Additionally they had a good handful of on-tap options covering a variety of beer types. The bartender wasn't the warm and fuzzytype, however he was very prompt, attentive, and professional. I opted for the combo of two; 1/4 rack of ribs and beef brisket. For sides, corn bread and twice baked mashed potatoes. I'll have to say each were very flavorful with thee own unique taste. These both are definitely someone's home receipe and I approve. The cornbread itself is hearty and flavorful enough to TRUELY qualify as a side.Overall this is a great place without the steep price you generally run accross in a BBQ joint (that's including the bourbons). The quality to price ratio definitely leaves the patron winning in this transaction. Well don't Black Dog.... Well done.", 
      "I am a BBQ fanatic, and I give every place at least one shot at winning me over. Let's just say Black Dog will be seeing a lot more of me! Our waitress was very helpful, happy and gave us good tips on what was good (apparently everything, from what we tried. The ribs were great. Pulled pork was really good. The sauces were \"OK\", but I could see myself learning to like them more. I didn't notice much dry rub, but it's a good sign when ribs aren't drowned in sauce. I liked their french fries a lot and my wife loved the twice baked potato casserole. Can't comment on the drink selection or bar. Overall it's a tight space and has a hip vibe, being in a university town you expect that usually. The bartender with the TIGHT fro (respect) was energized and really brought an upbeat vibe to the post lunch hour rush. Overall Black Dog was really good, bordering on great, for Illinois BBQ places, and I've been to a lot. We'll be back soon...", 
      "I recently moved away from Urbana and had to bid farewell to Black Dog (at least inasmuch as I will be able to go there frequently). I never bothered to review Black Dog on Yelp because, frankly, what is there to add to the veritable torrent of 5-star reviews here.Last week, though, I had occasion to travel to Kansas City (the self-proclaimed BBQ capital of the world) and made every effort to take in the best the city had to offer (a set of restaurants that naturally varies greatly depending on the Kansas City resident being asked). I had ribs and brisket at Oklahoma Joe's (in the gas station); ribs and burnt ends at Arthur Bryant's; and ribs and a burnt end sandwich at Q39. All were good, some even great (Q39 especially), but--and here is the point of my review--I found myself thinking constantly of Black Dog even as I was downing these admittedly famous and stellar BBQ items.Black Dog, in my mind, is really unmatched in its ability to offer outstanding BBQ at all times of the day and across the entire menu. From the ribs and burnt ends to the pulled pork, pulled rib sandwich, pulled chicken, and brisket, everything is truly wonderful. The sides, too--from the twice-baked potato to the pit beans--are excellent.I will admit that Kansas City's Q39 beat Black Dog in one area: ribs. The ribs at Q39 were quite simply the best I've ever had. But, even at Q39, I found myself wishing for every other aspect of Black Dog: the sides (which were sorely lacking everywhere in Kansas City), the price, and the other BBQ items. Writing this is the only way I could think of to add something new to the many compliments and superlatives about Black Dog on Yelp. So yes: even after a BBQ journey to KC, I remain steadfast in my belief that Black Dog is, hands down, the best BBQ restaurant out there. It doesn't get caught up in or weighed down by tradition or legacy. Instead, it has every aspect of BBQ honed to perfection and is clearly the result of careful planning by the owners, taking as they must have the best elements of BBQ throughout the U.S. and putting them together under the moniker Black Dog Smoke and Ale House.", 
      "This small eatery is generally very busy so be prepared to wait, especially at dinner hour. \u00a0IT IS WELL WORTH THE WAITDon't forget to go inside and put your name in the chalkboard.This is by far the BEST barbecue ever. Huge serving of pulled pork, brisket, \u00a0several combo plates. \u00a0Did I mention the sides. corn bread with pulled pork inside, loaded potato casserole, coleslaw like granny used to make! \u00a0Smoky, tender, juicy! \u00a0Several sauces to choose from-- from mild to HOT- ask for a sample or get the flyte offering to shareSeveral says a week Black Dog offers smoked turkey. It is amazing!If you are lucky you might get the \" burnt ends\". So far they are out each time I have visited. Decor is funky. Staff have all been excellent. Just the right balance of attention and very friendly, even on super busy Friday nights!!Try it. You will become a Black Dog addict!!", 
      "My favorite BBQ spot. There is always line and sometimes you would have to wait for 1 hour. But with beers and cheers it's always worth the wait for the food you get at Black Dog!", 
      "So... wow... this place was busy.I came to this place on a Wednesday night before the dinner rush and there was still a wait. The wait wasn't too bad, there was about 20-30 minutes before we were seated. This was at 5:45 pm. This place is apparently packed every night. So if you come here expect a wait... But wait. It's very worth it. So you walk up to free outside of this place and you can already smell the bbq smokey goodness. It only gets better from here. If you can get lucky enough to wait inside during a hot summer day... You're already doing pretty well. So you finally have a table. Grab a menu and order the burnt ends sandwich... I've never had anything like this before. I've had a lot of bbq coming from the south and living here the majority of my life. But the beef brisket here is amazing. It's more tender than any other beef brisket... drool... order it with the Carolina Red sauce. So good. Soooo good. The sweet potato fries are also good too. Corn bread... mmmm. The only thing that I could have done without is the slaw. Meh... I've had much better slaw, but in the sandwich is good. It compliments the rest of the flavors. Can we get back to that beef brisket? The end... get the burnt ends sandwich. That is all...", 
      "Simply the tops. Black Dog presents to you the best BBQ in a 50-state area. Its welcoming and knowledgeable staff will serve you a rotating cast of beers and a stable of meats and sauces that rivals anywhere you've ever been. The burnt ends are probably considered to be the specialty here, and they're typically out of them by 1 or 2 due to the popularity, but the true specialty is just outstanding, mouthwatering food. Aside from the everyday options of pulled pork, brisket, ribs and catfish, they also have great daily specials, such as pork tacos on Tuesday and an incredible cuban sandwich on Wednesday. And not to be forgotten, the sides and appetizers are killer as well.The long wait at usual dinner and lunch hours is well documented, but there is a wait because everyone who's heard of the place dreams of eating all of their meals there, all of the time.If you're stopping in for the first time, you'll never go wrong with a cornbread appetizer, sides of pit beans and twice baked potato casserole, and pulled pork with the georgia peach sauce."

      "woww, this place is TOP NOTCH! I had to give it 5 stars. I went to the University of Illinois at UC and during my four years there, I never heard of this place. WHAT A SHAME! I have truly missed out. I went there this past weekend after much hype from previous colleagues. The setting is just as you expect it.. always a wait [20-30 mins], very... barbequ-ie. You know, metal trays, easily cleanable, amazing smell, tasty beers, etc.Anyway, I heard so much about the burnt ends I had to get them. They only serve them twice a day. At least, this is what I am told. They have them when they open and they have them in the afternoon/dinner time. But once they run out, you'll have to wait til next time. :-( saddd face. Luckily, They had the burnt ends. Naturally, i ordered them. They were sooooo tender. I can't recall any other meat I've had in my LIFE as tender as these. They literally would fall apart when you picked them up. // Burnt ends - DEFINITELY get these. enough said. // Cornbread appetizer - easily the tastiest cornbread I've ever had. I think they put bacon in it? or some sort of meat. So soft and savory. It was very unique and definitely should be on your check. // Sauce flight - $2 - this is very cool for your first time but I wouldn't get it again. I wanted to try all the sauces but my favorite was the milos mustard. Also the vinegar one is great too. I forgot the name. I would get it your first time to kind of try all the sauces. // Sides - all of our sides were veryyyyy good. the FRENCH FRIES were amazing. They must be friend in pork fat. seriously, I have only had fries like that at one other place and they were fried in pure fat [or so i speculated]. Didn't get to try to sweet potato fries. The mac and cheese was good, a bit on the smaller portion.The only thing i didnt like... was the ribs. They were just a little bit to tough and didn't fall off the bone like i expected. I would opted out of these. But honestly, the burnt ends were so good that it didn't even matter what else I had.If you are every traveling through the champaign-urbana area... STOP AT THIS PLACE. Happy eating!", 
      "Three words: worth the wait.Okay, that's five words total, so I'll just add that I awarded 4 stars instead of 5 because we waited for an hour at lunch time. The second location can't come soon enough!When we were finally seated, Hubby was sad that they were already out of pulled rib sandwiches, so he got the burnt tip sandwich instead. One bite, and he was ready to die happy--that's all it took.The portions are ample but don't overdo it. Slaw is acceptable, but I like Native Foods' herbed sweet potato fries better. I thought the menu was short on vegetables, but I guess folks come here for the meat and carbs, eh? Word to the wise: even the cornbread has meat in it!", 
      "All of the food is great. You definitely need to come here if you're ever in Champaign. I usually get the pulled pork sandwich with Georgia peach sauce but I've also had rib tips and those are flame too. Only thing that is annoying is the wait and the fact that you can't make a reservation but I guess there's not a lot you can do about that considering it's a super popular place.", 
      "You can smell this amazing BBQ joint from a block away. The smell will draw you in, just don't let the wait scare you away...it is well worth it. Expect to wait about 20-30 minutes maybe longer for bigger groups. The place can seem a bit cramped when the line is long, so try to get a table that isn't next to the door. While you wait, try one of their rotating craft beers. They have a huge selection, as well as, a full-service bar. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the staff are all incredibly friendly and attentive. It seems like a family-run place because of the comforting ambience it alludes. I've heard the Burnt Ends are where it's at, but they go fast! They start serving them at 11am and 5pm so try and get there right at those times. I haven't had the chance to try them yet, as I've always arrived too late (probably my fault, always taking too long to get ready). I have ordered the Beef Brisket Sandwich both times I went to Black Dog and haven't been disappointed yet. I have tried a few different sauces with the brisket and loved them all. My favorite is the house-speciality sauce. The bun it is served on is also super soft. The cornbread is amazing, especially with a little bit of butter. And the twice-baked potato casserole is to die for! It is my favorite appetizer on the menu. The applesauce is also deliciously sweet and you can tell it is homemade. Black Dog is opening a new location in Champaign, our waitress informed us. She said it should hopefully be up and running by Winter 2015.", 
      "Hands down the best barbeque and burger joint in that area and arguably one of the best in the nation. The line could get long but it is worth it!", 
      "I'm a Texan just in the area passing through, so I'm a tough critic. That said...their meat was deeelish! I had the (lean) brisket and polish sausage. The brisket was very tender and I'm not used to polish sausage, but I especially liked it with the mustard sauce. We ordered the sauce sampler so we could try them all and I'm glad we did. The mustard was good with the pork and the sausage. Again, being Texan I liked the hotter ones. (Hot Georgia peach, Caroline Red, and Chipotle BBQ. I don't care for vinegar sauces, so be warned their default sauce is Lexington Dip and it's a vinegar one. We had the smoked cornbread as an appetizer and it was great! It's a unique flavor and texture for cornbread, but if you like things smoked I would try it!Only thing I didn't love were the sides. I had the vinegar slaw and potato salad. The family had the pit beans, chipotle slaw and sweet potato fries, they liked theirs...above average fries/beans. Just so/so for mine. The potato salad definitely needed a kick. I put the milo mustard on it and that helped. We were sad they were out of burnt ends! I would go back to have burnt ends and try different sides. Fun place, friendly service and very busy! Our family has always had black labs so we got a good looking baseball Tee souvenir of the \"black dog.\"", 
      "Cool little place...the pork was amazing and close to what legends are made of. \u00a0However, the brisket was less than legendary. \u00a0Based on what I'd heard and read I expected the meat to be on point and have some passion infused into it. \u00a0Pork - The pork had great flavor, was cooked perfectly and didn't have a single piece of gristle in it. \u00a0It went well with any of the sauces (I had the flight)Brisket - A disappointment. \u00a0It was either an inferior cut of meat or it was cooked wrong. \u00a0I could barely pull it apart with my hands as it was tough. \u00a0Once I finally got it apart it was tough and chewy.. It seemed like it had decent flavor in it, but was overshadowed by the texture of it. \u00a0Sides - baked beans - very good.. had a bit of bacon in them and had great flavor. Applesauce - I wanted something light and this hit the spot. \u00a0Its applesauce, not much to screw up. Sauces - I liked the chipotle bbq. \u00a0It had great flavor and a little bit of spice. \u00a0The texas bbq and milo's mustard were also my favorites.. good all around flavor. \u00a0I didn't care for the peach ones, but to each his own, the others were good as well . I travel thru here for work so I'll swing by again and give it another whirl, but I'll probably steer clear of the brisket for a bit.. maybe I\"ll try the burnt ends? \u00a0Till next time.", 
      "My biggest problem here was expectations everyone had set the bar so high. So I was expecting something much better than I was. Wasn't terrible. But wouldn't \u00a0say it's the best second-best in the nation I had the Two meet combo with pork ribs and pulled pork. The ribs were okay. Nothing special. And the meat involved on. I'm not a fan of vinegar barbecue sauce. So the Georgia peach was my favorite. The cornbread was good. The atmosphere was really cool. Overall Its too bad the expectations were so high I think I would've liked it better.", 
      "Best place in Champaign-Urbana to sit down, relax, and enjoy a great meal. Food is top-notch. I've tried the pulled pork, the ribs, the catfish, and their shrimp po' boy and will vouch for them all personally. The cornbread is moist and has some fun little bits of meat and beans in. I like to order the fries and slaw as sides -- people always come for the barbecue (and rightly so), but I think their fries are also the best in town. On top of everything, the staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming and laid-back. A must-visit if you are in the area, and worth the wait that you will almost certainly endure (even in the bitter cold of an Illinois winter).One note: they've recently switched their default sauce from the somewhat-spicy Carolina Red to a milder, liquid sauce. I have no complaints about the new one, but I prefer the Carolina Red, and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a serious to near-fatal aversion to spicy food.", 
      "Gud grub, excellent corn bread. In fact, it's the best I've ever had. I ordered the 3-meat combo platter. I chose 1/4 slab ribs, brisket, & pulled pork, cuz they were out of Burnt Ends :( \u00a0Also, u hav a choice of 5 sauces, I went with the fruity/cue-y Georgia Peach sauce. I also had a Nitro brew which was great cuz they don't leave you with the fullness of a regular beer. -1* for the gas taste of the pulled pork. Will definitely b bak!", 
      "I've only been to Black Dog twice, but I like the food and the beers. I don't even mind waiting when it's slightly busy as long as I'm not starving. I've never gotten anything I didn't like here and I plan to make more trips here for foodums. :-) I'll add more to this review the next time I eat here.", 
      "So everyone told me this was the best place to go when I visited the area. And I really want to give 3.5 stars but since I can't do that, I rounded down mainly because the brisket we got really was dry....and for a BBQ place with that much hype I was really kind of sad inside to get dry brisket...WE REALLY wish we had gotten the burnt ends, but they were sold out by the time we got seated...next time and I am sure that would have caused me to round up instead of down from 3.5 stars...The cornbread with pork in the cornbread, however, is genius! So so good and it added a little more moisture. I definitely need to try making it that way at home. And the pulled pork was also decent especially paired with one of their sweeter BBQ sauces that we got. The catfish was probably my favorite though which is surprising since I don't even normally order fish at a BBQ place, but here I was and I had heard it was good, and it actually was pretty good!The mac and cheese was only okay as well in my obsessiveness over anything with cheese and in particular mac and cheese, but the cornbread and catfish were the winners for me!", 
      "Go eat here now and order delicious meat and all of the sides. The pulled pork is incredibly tender and the cole slaw, corn bread, and sweet potato fries were the perfect accompaniments. I definitely didn't intend on eating as much as I did but I just couldn't stop myself.I was recommended to try Black Dog by former U of I students and I will definitely be returning when I'm traveling to Champaign for work.", 
      "By far the best bbq in Central Illinois. \u00a0(been here twice drove all the way from Bloomington)Brisket had a good smoke, bark and flavor. \u00a0While no where near the quality of TX brisket or even Smoque in Chicago, they were still better than anything you'll find at most locations outside of TX. Pork was a bit bland but still good especially with their sauces. \u00a0 Ribs were a bit tough, needed just a bit more time on the smoker but overall pretty good. \u00a0 They had an unusual spice that I couldn't quite place though. \u00a0I haven't tried the burnt ends yet, found out they serve them at 11am and 5pm and run out in about an hour. \u00a0I hear these are their best bbq item will be back to try them. We also tried their chips and salsa they were great, \u00a0it had good kick (which was kind of a bad thing since the waitress sucked at refilling drinks) \u00a0my only complaint is that it was billed as smokey salsa and I could not detect any smoke to the salsa. \u00a0Sides I've tried Pinto beans - mediocreSmoked sweet potato - ok but not great. \u00a0corn bread - goodFrench fries - goodA couple more comments - this place is a small restaurant\\bar. \u00a0Due to the size it stays packed and forces a long wait. (you have to sign your name and can be seated at a table or the bar) \u00a0We waited an hour each time. \u00a0 If it wasn't for the scarcity of quality bbq this place wouldn't be worth the wait. \u00a0(In central TX this place would get 2 stars)Since it is geared more as a restaurant you don't get to talk directly to the meat cutter, the waitstaff wasn't knowledgeable enough about barbecue to relay my wants to the cutter. \u00a0 \u00a0So last time when I ordered my brisket \"moist with extra bark\" it came out lean with very little bark. \u00a0One of the kitchen staff \"Kyle\" was awesome and provided great service, when there was a mistake on our order. \u00a0He mentioned they are working on opening a larger joint this fall hopefully it will cut down on the wait while not affecting the quality of food.", 
      "Pretty awesome BBQ and service.The wait is worth it. Even though I made sure to go at a time where I wouldn't have to wait. haha.We got in and our waiter was very polite and liked to joke around. After traveling around Europe for a few months, it was nice to come back to the US and be reminded about how nice people are in the Midwest.There were a lot of choices for sides and especially BBQ sauces.I got the beef brisket with fries and cornbread. The brisket was moist and not chewy at all. I was satisfied. I would have to say that my favorite part of the meal was the cornbread. It practically had a whole BBQ meal in it. There was meat, beans and it tasted amazing with the butter spread.I would definitely go back again before I graduate.", 
      "I have been here twice and don't live in town, but I've already asked my girlfriend if we can celebrate my birthday here... which is 6 months away.Last night we went in, and signed the waiting list, and we were immediately offered seats at the bar. I get the feeling the booths are most likely held for parties of 3 or more, which makes sense since space is so valuable here. Anyway we don't mind and our bartender Carly made me two of the tastiest old fashions I've ever had, I've had the burnt ends sandwich twice now and it's the best BBQ I've ever had. They have enough BBQ sauces for every palette, vinegary ones, sweet ones, hot, mild, and all the ones I've had were delicious. The corn bread was so fresh and delicious. Might try to convince my girlfriend to go back tonight...", 
      "Being from texas was excited to see something texan-ish in urbana.. i love the place.. for a sunday evening in summer where urbana is pretty quiet, this place was surprisingly busy... the decor reminded me of austin! food was pretty good too..was it the best brisket i ve ever had? maybe not but its still quite good. Also had their buffalo wings which were really good..", 
      "The best smoked meat in the area, hands down. Love the ends, brisket and pulled pork. I get the sweet Georgia peach sauce because I'm pretty much a light weight on hot food. It's perfect for me. The cornbread is by far my favorite thing on the menu. Yes, I have purchased just that. Always ask for more butter, though!They do take-out really well, which is nice since they're always so busy. Everything is wrapped individually and easily reheated. Service is always great. Beers are pretty good. So why the four stars? Partly because I can't give 4.5...but mostly because I LOVE a bloody Mary, and theirs are just terrible. I've tried x3 with no success. They taste overwhelmingly of actual bbq sauce and meat. Like a liquid dinner platter. If that's your thing, go for the 5 stars.", 
      "Black Dog is almost always perfect. They do a wonderful Carolina-style BBQ which focuses on vinegar, spice and smoke, not so much on sweetness. Everything I've ordered has been good, but my go-to is the 2-meat combo platter, which comes with 2 sides and is a great value for the amount of food you get (I always leave feeling stuffed, and I can eat a lot). If you're into catfish, try the catfish with mustard sauce; I never get tired of it. When they have them, the beef ribs are fantastic. There is a good variety of beers on tap, and the selection is constantly changing; there is usually something for everyone. I've found their cocktails to be overly-sweet, but to be fair I've only tried a few. As everyone has mentioned, lines can be long, but the wait is worth it, especially in the summer when it's not painful to stand outside. The only bad experience I've had with waitstaff was once when a friend was asked how his beer was and he said it wasn't what he expected and then got interrogated rather uncomfortably by the waiter about what he meant. Usually everyone is fairly pleasant, even when the restaurant is packed and hectic. As others have also mentioned, if you want burnt ends go early!", 
      "Excellent BBQ. Great draft beers on tap. I had the beef brisket and burnt ends combo with cornbread and twice baked potato salad, The meats were both delicious and tender. I had the yummy sweet Georgia bbq sauce. The cornbread is really unique and quite tasty. Very busy and small seating area so plan your trip there accordingly.", 
      "Amazing food.Amazing Drinks.Best goddamn BBQ in the state.The BEST wings in town, hands down.(they are smoked and then fried WITH NO BREADING, the way wings should always be!)i tend to get the chicken wings and a side salad- which is actually good- and spend like $11 (dont forget to tip!)The place is tiny and packed, and the wait is long, but dont come here on your lunch break or if you are starving. most people would knock it down for the wait, but if you are a seasoned townie, you know damn well it's worth it. Everything there is divine.Obviously no place for vegans, but they do have vegetarian options if you do get dragged to a smokehouse!", 
      "If you want to eat at a glorious cavern of mustachioed waiters, succulent meats and flavorful sides (that might contribute to well-worth-it wait gain) look no further. \u00a0Black Dog Smoke & Ale House offers up some of the best pulled pork to have ever graced my taste buds. \u00a0If you make it in time to enjoy the glorious burnt ends, first thank the gods, and then savor the flavors because you may never have the chance to taste them again. All in all, if you are willing to wait to get a seat you won't be disappointed.", 
      "Ok, I know what you're thinking. Good barbecue in Illinois? Yes. Absolutely. This is some of the best bbq I have ever had. When you first walk in, you are to write your first name and party number on a white board and wait to be seated. The wait was not too bad, but we came on a Monday for lunch. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. Our waitress was very friendly and didn't mind suggesting things. Try the burnt ends. Delicious. The twice baked potato casserole was excellent too. It was all great. I only give it a 4 star because of the seating. It's a little crammed, but it won't affect your dining experience at all.", 
      "I think this place is good, and I enjoy going here, but I don't think it's the best BBQ I've ever had.The meat is cooked well, smoky and tender, but the thing that doesn't do it for me is the sauce (there's a few choices). I haven't tried them all, but I haven't found one I like.The side dishes are quite good though, namely the cornbread, beans (so smoky and delicious) and sweet potato fries. This place is small and always packed, so be prepared to get there when it first opens or during non-peak times (or just be prepared to wait, in other words, stand against the wall and watch others eat three feet in front of you).", 
      "Must eat BBQ, I would rank it with #marksfeedstore in Louisville Ky. They were out of turkey & burnt ends", 
      "Oh My! This is the BEST BBQ that I have ever had! I love the burnt ends! The fat of the meat just brings you a very special taste! And we also ordered the smoked sweet potato, sweet potato fries, pulled pork, beef brisket,they are all out of our expectation! So good! Will come back!", 
      "Been eyeing this places for a while and finally hit town early enough to get in the door. Little did I know the burnt ends become available at 5 p.m. After a short wait, I was able to get some ends, chicken and ribs. All were moist and smokey and excellent. They offer a wide variety of sauces, well beyond the typical hot, sweet, ketchup you find at most places. The beans were the perfect side, while the fries were just OK. A small but varied craft lineup and a bigger/better selection of whiskey (Pappy 20) left more drink options than I could even imagine sampling in one visit. A return trip is definitely in order. Just make sure you're here before 5.", 
      "The system they have to get your name on the list is great because it confuses first timers. Those burnt ends are mine, homie.", 
      "I try to eat here whenever I visit my daughter at U of I. By far the best barbecue in central Illinois and for me it rivals great BBQ joints from Texas. Brisket is excellent along with a spicy BBQ sauce on the side. Good ribs and the smoked catfish is fantastic. I usually get the combo platter of brisket and smoked catfish along with two tasty sides. You can't go wrong with any of the sides, but my favorite is the sweet potato fries. Nice beer selection, and if you want to feel like you're hanging out and eating BBQ in Austin, they have Shiner and Lone Star in bottles.Only catch...the place is so popular and so good (and so small) that wait times can be very long. Come for an afternoon meal on weekends and your wait shouldn't be too bad.", 
      "I went here for the first time a couple days ago. \u00a0When people told me about there being a big line at the door, they weren't lying. \u00a0We were expecting 5 people to show for dinner and so I signed the paper at the front for 5. \u00a0When one didn't show up the waitress informed me that everyone needed to be present in order to be seated and that nobody could join your table at a later time. \u00a0On to the food: \u00a0I had the beef brisket platter with corn bread and their beans. \u00a0Both sides were absolutely amazing. \u00a0I tried a little of my sister's potato salad...I think and it was great as well. \u00a0As far as the brisket goes, I kind of expected it to be seasoned better. \u00a0It was very tender and perfectly cooked but I thought it would have seasoning aside from the BBQ sauce served in a separate dipping cup. \u00a0All things considered I give the food as a whole 4.5 stars, the service gets 3.5 stars because the waitress seemed a bit short when she stated the seating policy. \u00a0True there was a sign at the front, but I didn't see it because the place was crowded. \u00a0Maybe put multiple signs up. \u00a0Please hurry and get your second location going!", 
      "Amazing food and worth the wait. Waiter was very nice and funny. One of the best BBQ places I've had and the best in Central Illinois for sure!", 
      "There seems to be a unanimous vote for Black Dog as the best restaurant in Chambana... I'm sorry but I don't see it. I've been there over a dozen times and the only item on the menu I LOVED was the cornbread (full of pulled pork) -- Delicious!!! Everything else is just \"meh\". This is descent BBQ, but I definitely wouldn't say it's amazing or anything. As a matter of fact, their burgers and most side-dishes are absolutely a waste of money! Also, I've tried all of their BBQ sauces and the only one I really liked was the sweet GA peach, the rest are not that good.I was a bit torn on how to rate this restaurant -- they have descent BBQ, I absolutely love the cornbread, but I hate waiting in line, and I find their snooty \"we're the best restaurant in town\" attitude EXTREMELY off-putting!", 
      "Just go! Even if there's a wait, it is the best BBQ place in town. I highly recommend the chipotle smoked wings.", 
      "This is good bbq folks! In Champaign/Urbana whodda thunk? First time visit had pulled pork, burnt ends, cole slaw and bbq beans. Meat was plenty flavorful, and not dried out. In fact the burnt ends were remarkably not dry. Lots of smoky flavor, so good. In my opinion, what makes really good bbq is some attention to sides, and these absolutely did not dissapoint. Slaw was crispy, fresh and savory. Good balance of flavors and not too sweet or creamy. Beans were equally well done, really savory and again seemingly devoid of the too much sugar syndrome of extremely mediocre bbq joints. This place is soooo not a mediocre joint, cant wait to get a chance to go back!to", 
      "Amazing. Pork was perfectly tender. Ribs had just right amount of chew. You get to choose from several different sauces, many with a mango or peach base. Bit tough to get in but service was quick and friendly. Food came out fast and we were never thirsty.", 
      "If you only want volume and value, you can go to Lil' Porgy's. If you want fast, mediocre BBQ, Hickory River is a bit further north.But if you want amazing BBQ and equally inspired sides in an unmatched atmosphere, go to Black Dog. It's the best BBQ you can get in the area (dare I say Illinois?): pulled pork, ribs, brisket, chicken, it's all good. The ambiance is unmatched. Large TV's above the bar if you want to watch something or a warm, inviting seating area if you wanna talk. A huge selection of craft beers. And to top it off, seasonal, local specials (I once had the smoked beet salad, which was glorious).Take my word for it, the wait isn't that bad. If you want to go out for great food with an old acquaintance, a business meeting with the roommates or perhaps a casual date with the designated lady/gentleman friend, Black Dog will always do you right.", 
      "The food is amazing! \u00a0The wait to get a table is horrible! \u00a0And the service sucks! \u00a0Continuously, I've found this to be true. The only thing saving this place is the amazing food! \u00a0It's wonderful! \u00a0It's so good that it makes up for the crappy service and the 30 minute wait for a table. It doesn't matter what you order....it's amazing!", 
      "Best BBQ in the CU. A must eat! My menu favorite is the Carolina Burger with cheddar (pulled pork on a locally sourced beef hamburger and Carolina red sauce- which is the best bbq sauce i've ever had, with the perfect amount of spice and flavor and not sickly sweet). Everything is good here though honestly you can't go wrong.", 
      "I have been wanting to try the Black Dog for some time and finally had the chance after a day of golf. Arrived at 4:45 and thought we would get right in. Wrong, waited about 10 minutes. This is a good sign with that many people there at this time of day during the week. Waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and provided great service. It only got better from there. Ordered the three meat combo of burnt ends, brisket and ribs. I have to say the burnt ends were my favorite, but they all were perfectly cooked and the taste was outstanding. I went with the Carolina Red sauce and it had just enough zip in it. I was pleasantly surprised with their choice of beers and IPA's. I went with a tough to find Dog Fish Head Brown Ale on tap. I will be back Black Dog very soon. Nice work!", 
      "This is the new place to go in Champaign for a casual bbq eats.First off.. the beer sampler is the way to go. \u00a0I was impressed with six beers for barely anything.Second.. the waiters are friendly but they definitely didn't offer the best advice on food. \u00a0The person I was with greatly advised that we get the appetizers: \u00a0burnt ends (which is basically brisket and was really delicious but spicy) and cornbread (good but I've had better).Tried the get two platter.. the catfish is dry and I would definitely skip it. \u00a0I would have gotten brisket again but I wanted to be adventurous and went for the pulled pork. \u00a0Meh.. it's okay. \u00a0I had the Georgia Peach bbq sauce which was sweet but spicy.As for drinks.. the white Manhattan was not good. \u00a0Then they were out of all vermouth so they couldn't really make me an Old Fashioned or anything else for that matter. \u00a0I think I had a Cosmopolitan. \u00a0Ummmm.. it wasn't that good either. \u00a0Probably best to stick with beer at this spot."

      "Black Dog is by far the best BBQ in the chambana area and, in my opinion, one of the best (maybe the best) restaurant in chambana. I might be biased since I love BBQ and, as I said, this place definitely has the best BBQ in the area. I've been coming here regularly for 3 years and I have never been disappointed.A heads up to anyone that hasn't been here before, you will probably have to wait in line. In the 3 years that I've been coming here I've only been seated without waiting in line once and that was when I came on a Tuesday in the middle of the summer before the dinner rush. The longest I've waited was 2 hours and it was still totally worth it! If you're not down for a wait, you can just call ahead and get your food to go or even make a to go order in person if you get there and decide the line is too long.The most recommended dish has to be the burnt ends, but they run out quickly. They make burnt ends twice a day (at 11:00 am and 5:00 pm, I think). I would also highly recommend the ribs and rib tips. I generally get the brisket and chicken as well, but I wouldn't say those are the most amazing dishes. They've got plenty of BBQ sauces to choose from as well. I've recently been getting the mustard, which is delicious with everything I've tried it with (brisket, chicken, ribs, rib tips, burnt ends).If you're in the area and you want great BBQ this is the only place to go.", 
      "Fear not, Black Dog totally lives up to the hype. I WISH there was a barbecue place in Chicago that even compared. I'm not one for moderation, so whenever I'm here I have to get everything that I really like. Which is a lot: Chicken wings, pulled pork, hot Georgia peach sauce, twice baked potato casserole, sweet potato fries, beans, and cornbread. I also like to get a flight of all of the sauces because even though the hot Georgia peach is pretty much one of the best things I have ever eaten, I like to dip my hunks of pork in all of the different flavors. Oh, and they have an awesome selection of craft beers and cocktails. One time I came here and ate so much that I couldn't eat anything else for 24 hours.", 
      "I can see why this place gets a lot of hype. The food is really delicious--all aspects; I have not been disappointed.So far I've tried the beef brisket and pulled pork; along with the twice-baked potato casserole, and sweet potato fries.The cornbread does have pulled pork in it but it's not the most amazing thing I've had. It's alright, I thought the flavor would be more apparent but it was just okay.It can take the LONGEST time to get a seat but that's okay. So far our servers have been kind, except one time where we had such a horrid experience with one waitress who was just in the worst mood. Otherwise, we had another server who was much nicer.I need to go back!", 
      "Amazing smoked catfish and twice baked potato casserole among other great choices. \u00a0Georgia peach BBQ sauce is good.Everything on the menu is delicious and flavorful - wow! \u00a0Great beer selection.Prepare to wait in line for a table...", 
      "As a teacher in Central Illinois, it doesn't really get much better than summer! I moved down here for weather like this! This place is on Broadway Avenue, adjacent to the Bunny Tavern (which I think is associated with this place...I mean, they were advertising the Bunny Tavern's Duck Fat Fries on Sunday in the Black Dog Window). I wish Black Dog had outdoor seating like Bunny Tavern, but onto the BBQ!One would just assume when dining with a former beauty pageant queen that I would have to practice proper manners and not eat with my hands. I will divulge on this a little later, but keep this in mind!I arrived about 12:15 and I knew there be a wait......about 15 minutes! It was perfect because my friend Elsie, the aforementioned former beauty queen and fellow PE teacher was across town.It was like clockwork! She showed up and we were seated! NICE!Rather than be overwhelmed by all the options of barbecue Nirvana, I did my research via Yelp and Noshfolio. I knew I was getting a combo with 2 sides and two different barbecue sauces. \u00a0I made a fantastic choice with the smoked chicken and the pulled pork! I got some salad and beans, but the highlight of the meal was the chicken FALLING off the bone. Falling, like Fall Out Boy or the season after summer...FALL! Remember when I said that it was falling off the bone? One might ask, \"How do you know if you were eating with a knife and fork?\" I will mention that the chicken came with a thigh that was very difficult to eat with a knife and fork! At this point, Elsie reminded me that she grew up in a family when they had dinner, they sat down and spoke with their mouths full!I started to eat like a savage caveman who hadn't eaten since the wooly mammoth he killed three weeks ago. Elsie ordered their pulled pork sandwich, famous cornbread, and twice baked potato casserole. She couldn't finish and got a to go box.I went with the Texas and the Chipotle sauces. I didn't know the difference, and it didn't help when our waiter didn't tell me which was which! I asked and was glad I did because I had them mixed up! I also wanted to buy a medium t shirt to represent Black Dog in Paxton, but to no avail, they only had larges!I would have given 4.3333333 stars if I could. Assessment is huge as a teacher, but I just can't \"round up\" because of the service! I will be back to try some of their smoked shrimp (Thursdays), fish tacos (Friday), or late night menu! Hopefully the wait staff has some more females working next time I am there! MERCY! Requirement to work on a Wednesday afternoon at Black Dog? Must have crazy facial hair or short curly black hair! See you soon, dog!", 
      "Wait time on a Saturday evening is long, signed onto the board and waited almost 1 hour for dinner. \u00a0The place is rather small and service is okay. \u00a0They were out of a few items including the beef brisket which I wanted to try. \u00a0Ordered the combo platter, which I was expensive ($19) considering the normal-to-small portion size. \u00a0The pulled pork, ribs, burnt ends, tasted good but wasn't exceptional. The different sauces were sweet and spicy ($2 for sauce platter). \u00a0Carry out would be a better choice if you don't want to wait for a table. \u00a0Overall, it was good.", 
      "This is one of the only good places to eat in Urbana-champagne. If I am being honest, I don't really \"know\" BBQ or smoked meat...but I know what I like. And this place was good. I had a party of 8, which had to be split, so we had almost everything on the menu. It was all really good. Each of us had a different BBQ sauce. I am not to into really spicy fairs, so I had the Georgia Peach on the meatloaf. It was really good. The reason I gave only 4 stars is because the sweet tea was terrible. It was warm. I know it seems picky, but I was really thirsty!", 
      "Finally got a chance to try out Black Dog after receiving so many recommendations, and it didn't disappoint. One of the best places to eat in Chambana. I got the pulled pork and brisket. Both had great flavor and were very tender. The brisket was some of the best I've ever had. But the real stars were the sides. The cornbread is great and had pieces of pulled pork in it. Their twice baked potato casserole was easily my favorite part of the meal.I recommend getting there early as they were very busy and they sold out of Burnt Ends quickly (going to have to go back and to try them. Overall a great, authentic BBQ place that does it right.", 
      "I'm from Texas & my friend's & I wanted to try out some BBQ while we were out here in Illinois. The pork ribs were well cooked. The burnt ends were cooked so well that it literally crumbled. Loved it. Potato salad was standard. Corn bread was a little different in what it was made from but okay. All came out to around $15. Definitely a place to try if you want some good Texas smoked BBQ!", 
      "Great barbecue. \u00a0I had the three combo platter with ribs, brisket and pulled pork. The pulled pork was put of which world, ribs were good too but the brisket is worth a skip- nothing to write home about. Definitely get the corn bread and beans - both were divine! Great value for money but be prepared to wait", 
      "I'm from Cali and I'm just visiting so I heard that this was kind of a big deal place to go to. So I tried it out with some friend! Omg I was in heaven!! It was soooo good! Definitely must try!", 
      "What can I say that hasn't been said already? Black Dog is the bomb! Delicious food, awesome staff, great atmosphere. What more can you ask for? We go anytime we can. The wait kind of sucks, but that just shows you that it's good. Easy 5!", 
      "I've been here twice. Its always packed. Cool atmosphere. The first time I remember there being better service. Second time not so much. We waited for ten minutes just to get menus. I got the beef brisket with the Carolina sauce and sweet potato fries, I liked mine. The fries were the best sweet potato fries ever. Rest of family had pulled pork and they said it was dry. They were out of their homemade hot sauce and awkwardly brought two pretty much empty bottles to the table saying they needed to make more.", 
      "Love finding a new restaurant to try. Wait was not terrible, but there was one. \u00a0Food was great service was good. \u00a0We are not a family \u00a0who likes to linger, so the fast pace was perfect. \u00a0Calling themselves an ale house is a bit misleading since most beers are bottled. \u00a0Will definitely dine here again when we are in town!", 
      "Wow. I was raised on Kansas City BBQ and have lived down south in two different states. I moved to CU skeptical of Illinois barbecue. (I lived in Michigan for awhile, and what they serve is the most heinous excuse for BBQ I've come across. Obviously Illinois ain't BBQ stupid like that state north and east of us on the other side of Lake Michigan.)Damn, has Black Dog has got it going on! We're talkin the real deal KC style burnt ends. The pulled pork is the meatier Georgia style, and better than any I ever had in Tennessee. The mustard based sauce was authentically Carolina. I swear, the Carolina Red was the best sauce I've had outside of Kansas City. The sauce is actually reminiscent of Gates (Hi! May I help you?!) in Kansas City more than any other sauce I've ever had. The pit beans were real pit beans. (Never got anything comparable in Tennessee.) And the burnt ends were moist, smokey, and delicious. Southern transplants, you best git yo asses down there quick, y'all. Hell, all y'all need to git yo asses down there quick, so long as you save me a spot in line. I guarantee you'll slap your momma and ask her why she can't cook like that! Can I give six stars, cause damn, they're worth it! And I haven't even mentioned the draught beer selection!", 
      "3.5 stars.Had the opportunity to try some takeout from Black Dog recently. As a KC resident, you can bet I'm picky about my Q. Black dog holds up just fine, but doesn't shine.Meat: The pulled pork is probably a 4/5 on its own. It has a deep smokey flavor and great texture - not thin and strandy like some other pulled pork can be - it comes in big hearty strips. The ribs, on the other hand, were just a 3/5 for me: they had decent flavor and a small smoke ring, but the texture was off. It took a good amount of work to pull the meat off the bone and was more chewy rather than tender. The sauce is mediocre; good heat but heavy on the tomato and not a lot of depth.Sides: mashed potatoes are creamy and satisfying, but the fries were limp and dry. I wouldn't get them again.Something about this place just doesn't sit right with the BBQ snob in me. The fact that I would come here and get the pulled pork is telling, I think - it's good, but it is one of the easier cuts of meat to make. Ribs are much harder to get right, and that lack of ability shows through at Black Dog. The biggest reveal? I found that I was uninterested in eating the leftovers later...that rounds Black Dog down to 3 stars for me.", 
      "Very delicious! Everything was very good. My favorite was the black dog burger with the Georgia peach BBQ sauce. The burnt ends were good but a pretty small app. The collard greens and sweet potato fries were my favorite sides. The applesauce and meatloaf special were overrated for me but my brother loved it! Order to go if you want to have a slightly less exhausting wait.", 
      "Have reviewed Black Dog before, but over two years ago. This place still ranks at the top of my list for good places to eat. The service we received tonight was A++. Couldn't ask for more. Food was spot on.No surprise that it takes a while to get a table here, since Black Dog is such a good place to dine. Gets kinda noisy, but it is still tolerable.Overall this casual place is number one in my book.", 
      "I rarely give 5's and this is definitely a 5Hands down, best bbq I've had, on top of that, extremely cheap prices.it is always packed though, best if you come early for lunch (around 11) anytime else it will be full with a wait.rib tips and burnt ends are straight up legit", 
      "I loved this place! It is delicious! Make sure to come here early though because the lines are long and they will only seat your party is complete.We ordered the ribs with the peach sauce. The ribs were yummie but were not fall off the bone type. \u00a0Despite this, the meat was still very tender. With the ribs came two sides. I opted for the spicy potato salad and the sweet potato fries. I liked both the sides but I think I enjoyed the spicy potato salad more.The corn bread is its own beast. \u00a0It is OUTSTANDING. It is definitely corn bread you probably have never tasted anywhere else. They put moist sweet pork meat in it!!!! What a wonderful surprise. I could eat a bunch of it up!Overall food was good, service was good, and our food came out fast. A great experience! Looking forward to a return visit!", 
      "I've had Black Dog three ways -- as an in-house meal, as carry-out eaten right nearby (so no heat was lost), and at a catered event at the South Research Park.The meat is really, really good. Tender with a deep-smoke, slow-cook flavor -- the pork is excellent (especially on the bone), the chicken is good. The quality is consistent -- good every time. I keep hearing about the amazing burnt ends, but I have not yet lucked into finding them available. They run out early and frequently.The sauces are average to below average. Sorry -- Porgy's (another local bbq joint) has much more robust and flavorful sauce (Texas style). I'm not just talking about one sauce -- I've had several (including the Georgia Peach, which a friend recommended). The sauces tend to be light on flavor and thin on substance. The sides are anywhere from excellent to okay. My favorite is the twice-baked potato casserole. Amazingly rich and delicious. A friend had the Southwestern potato salad and also loved it, except he said it was room temp rather than cold or warm. The sweet potato fries are good, but not great (they could use a dusting of curry powder or something). The pit beans have a nice meat flavor (bacon added) but also suffer from the same thin base, weak seasoning, and lack of complexity as the sauces. The coleslaw is bad. The cabbage is thick cut and bitter, the vinegar dressing nearly flavorless. I'm not a fan of NC bbq, and this reminds me of a bad side in NC (where I lived for a year).The stuffed cornbread appetizer is very good -- a wedge of dense and flavorful not-too-sweet skillet bread with some meat and extras worked in. But it too should be served warm and with butter, rather than slightly cool from the fridge.In all, if you are a meat lover willing to doctor or add your own sauce, Black Dog offers superior entre fair. The sides are kind of hit or miss -- choose what others recommend.The restaurant is in a very small space, so go early, expect to wait, or even accept getting turned away (happened to us once). Other people have told me the bar is good, but I don't drink and couldn't sit through the noise if I did. The place is usually packed and extremely loud. Just standing at the counter waiting to pay, I felt like my head was being banged on a gong. I also had to navigate a small, packed entryway going both in and out -- that may not seem like much, but it's tough on us quiet types. The good news is Black Dog offers a full carryout menu and accepts all credit cards except American Express. They do a good job of packing up the food to go, too.", 
      "Heard a lot of high regard for the place and I figured wife and I would be disappointed and didn't feel like waiting in the line. \u00a0Figured it was more hype than actual goodness. \u00a0I was wrong.The wait was probably 30 minutes, but the beer selection and the ability to get the beers in different sizes made the wait a non-factor.Sat at the bar and the prices were more than reasonable with very laid back friendly service. \u00a0Not the world's best BBQ, but very good. \u00a0The atmosphere learns a lot to the senses and I enjoyed the meal. \u00a0The smoked sweet potato was a perfect side dish. \u00a0Rib tips were not the meatiest tips I've had, but very good. \u00a0Wife had the brisket and was impressed. \u00a0Not too moist, not too dry, the way she likes it.Serving size isn't huge, but enough to fill the belly after some beers. \u00a0Definitly a worth while visit.Great staff, service, atmosphere, beer, and food. \u00a0What else could I ask for, I guess I paid the cheap Urbana parking meter, but I'm sure there is a free lot and I think the parking is free after hours.", 
      "Since I got to Champaign, I have been recommended by several of my friends to try this place. I had an opportunity to try the pulled pork sandwich with my choice in egg salad and sweet potato fries. The food tasted fantastic. The pork was seasoned quite well and glazed quite nicely. It is no wonder there is often a waiting line in order to be seated. The service was also excellent despite being packed. I highly recommend this place if you are visiting Champaign and are looking for a bite.", 
      "This is it, the premier place for food in C-U. \u00a0If you don't visit it while in town and care about what you eat you definitely missed out. \u00a0A constantly changing draft list and new specials every day give you options other than the 5 star BBQ. \u00a0The only thing to be warned about is because of the size you will have to wait, i'd go at odd times. \u00a0Georgia Peach sauce on everything.", 
      "Really good food. Some of the best in Urbana. Long waits but I'm fortunate enough to work virtually across the street and therefore just get take-out.The best time to go is around 3pm or after 9pm. Those are the times it's typically quieter. Otherwise take-out is highly recommended.", 
      "I love the BBQ here! I'm always worried that places with lots of sauces and sandwiches aren't conscious about my gluten free needs but I eat here regularly and haven't had any problems. \u00a0The fries are NOT safe for fellow Celiacs, and neither is the corn bread (which I hear is fabulous). I do always make sure to tell them that I have a \"gluten allergy\" and require special attention. \u00a0All of the sauces are gluten free as are all of the meats! People don't really rave about the ribs because they are dry rubbed and not fall off the bone but they are yummy. \u00a0The brisket and pulled pork are my go-to favs. \u00a0The burnt ends, when you can get them, are delicious but people either really love them or really dislike them. \u00a0As for sides, the pit beans, apple sauce and potato casserole are all great compliments to their BBQ. \u00a0They offer GF beer along with some delicious mixed drinks too!The wait at the restaurant is generally pretty long (especially during peak times) but you can call in and take out which is generally what we do. \u00a0Definitely one of my local favorites!", 
      "this place is worth the wait! although the wait at the door may be long, the order turnaround is speedy and the food is absolutely orgasmic! you'll find yourself inappropriately suckling the boney remains of your meal. seriously. check it out.", 
      "Best BBQ in central IL. go there!", 
      "My favorite restaurant in Champaign-Urbana! Waitstaff is so courteous and friendly! I'm there with my roommate every Thursday evening because of the special side of mac and cheese, its seriously the best mac and cheese ever! Pulled Pork Sandwich is amazing as well as the Cuban Sandwich! You have to try the Smoked Artichoke dip on Tuesday evenings as well. You have to wait sometimes about an hour to be seated but its so worth it!", 
      "Tried to get into this place and the line was horrendous.....unfortunately I didn't have time to wait. \u00a0Second visit presented the same dilemma but this time i had plenty of time and it was well worth the wait. \u00a0The cornbread is a meal in itself and pretty amazing!! \u00a0Relaxed place to go, I sat at the bar and it was fun watching the action in the kitchen. \u00a0Service was fabulous and they were patient with all my questions. \u00a0Will definitely return and will be sure I have time to wait!!", 
      "Horrible service. I payed for a drink and the person who took the order just forgot about it and served several other people and I had to ask another worker to get my drink. Waited 14 teams before it was my party's turn to get seated but didn't get served because one of the member of the party ordered food for togo. I explained each members were intending to order food and will not eat the togo food while in the restaurant. However, we were not served and left after receiving the togo items the one member ordered. Regret leaving tip for the drink.", 
      "There is lots to love here, but also lots that is just average. \u00a0The building is awesome. \u00a0Right in downtown Urbana. \u00a0A long wood bar with booths along the perimeter. \u00a0Tiled floors, and a great worn in pub feel. \u00a0The service is friendly and they know the menu. \u00a0Food and beer come out relatively quickly.The beer selection is nice. \u00a0About 8 rotating taps of quality micros from around the nation and some Belgians as well. \u00a0They also have a rotating cask which is great. \u00a0Plenty of bottles as well. \u00a0I enjoyed Summit Oatmeal Stout on cask.All fine and good, but the food left something to be desired for me. \u00a0I wanted the burnt ends sandwich. \u00a0They were out, that is not a problem at all. \u00a0It is great that they can go through the good stuff like that. \u00a0I ended up with a half rack of pork spare ribs. \u00a0The ribs are very good. \u00a0I did enjoy them, but not great. \u00a0I do not like the BBQ sauce at all. \u00a0it is like a tomato paste, almost marinara like. \u00a0The sides are crap though. \u00a0Mac and cheese seemed like it was sitting out forever. \u00a0Similar to old mac and cheese that has been sitting out and hardened for hours after Christmas diner. \u00a0The slaw seemed almost rancid. \u00a0I could not eat it. \u00a0Luckily I did not get a sandwich that would have been covered in it.Overall, I really wanted to love this place. \u00a0The meat is very good though not great, and got to love the beer selection. \u00a0As well as a very nice Bourbon selection. \u00a0Though overall, I think the reviews here are a bit of a home town bias. \u00a0I will continue to support these guys, but not up to the hype I had been expecting.", 
      "This place is absolutely outstanding. My friends and I come here all the time, usually about twice a week, with an obligatory visit to their late-night. Every single item I've had was delicious. From burnt ends, to beef ribs, pork ribs, pastrami sandwiches, smoked duck, fried chicken, brisket, and a stupid number of late night home made sausages among other things, every single entree is a new and delicious adventure. The meat is smoked to perfection, the dry rubs are all world class, and you get your choice of BBQ sauce to suit your taste. The cornbread even has pulled pork baked into it. The sides are all good, but the best are definitely the sweet potato fries. I did not expect to find food this good in Urbana-Champaign, but here it is. This place is a real hidden gem.But this place doesn't stop at the food. The beer selection is great, with an awesome bottled selection (not huge, but it's quality), and a constantly changing set of beers on tap. Add to this their whiskey selection and cocktails (pineapple pepper tequila margarita...) , and this place is a fantastic bar on top of being a top-notch restaurant.Oh, and did I mention the price is beyond reasonable? 5/5 this place is worth a visit. Or two. Or twenty.", 
      "Can't go wrong with most anything on the menu - yeah, even the falafel and smoked polish (I suggest Milo's mustard sauce) are great. \u00a0Not a huge fan of the portobello \u00a0sandwich nor the ribs. \u00a0The staff is great. \u00a0Beer selection is regularly changing, not that I drink beer that often but its fun to go in a get the dog bone flight to try new things. \u00a0The late night menu is also awesome. \u00a0They make, in house some of them, different kinds of hot dogs and other tasty crazy tid bits that may only hang around for a week or so. \u00a0One of my faves was a smoked tomato soup where they smoked all the ingredients, it was meatless and awesome!They also host special dinner throughout the year. \u00a0I've attended a few and never been disappointed.", 
      "Great little spot! \u00a0Cute and appropriately grungy location (love the building and signage), great food (burnt-end sandwich, YUM!), and a good selection of beers. \u00a0Delicious house barbecue sauce.The chips and salsa were mediocre, but they're not why I stopped by.", 
      "Absolutely my favorite restaurant in the area. Barbecue isn't plain burgers as many seem to thing. It's pulled pork, brisket, and chicken and Black Dog EXCELS in these three foods. Some of the best pork and brisket I have ever had, and their sauces are all really different and delicious. Seriously, you need to try it!Tip: getting it carry out is super quick.", 
      "Oh man... Black Dog... I wish you were closer!! Though I'm considering driving down to Champaign just to indulge in your tasty 'que and brews! Just thinking about you is making my mouth water!This is a great joint in your are looking for some solid BBQ \u00a0 They also have a nice selection of microbrews. Get ready to wait though... We went at 3pm on Saturday and we still waited for a solid 20 minutes! Though the wait during peak lunch and dinner hours is way worse... It's almost painful watching plates of mouthwatering meats pass by you while you stand there helplessly. But trust me, the wait is worth it!", 
      "We were originally going to go to Golden Harbor, but they are closed on Monday nights. So we decided to call Black Dog to see how long the wait is, when we heard it was only 10-15 mins wait, we wasted no time. We put our name down and still had to wait like 20-30 mins. We had 6 people so it was harder. They eventually squeezed the 6 of us in a booth. Burnt ends was amazing! It was so perfect. mmm! Ribs was also delicious. The meat came off the bone perfectly. Twice baked potato casserole tasted more like mashed potato. I didn't think it was very special. Beans were surprisingly good! I usually hate all types of beans, but I found myself trying more than 1 bite of my friend's dish. The only thing that I was MEH about was the sauce. I thought Georgia Peach was a bit too sweet, but the meat is already seasoned, so I didn't even eat it with the sauce.We saw the owner working and he even talked to us about the food. He's such a chill guy and I can tell that he loves his job.", 
      "This place was *AMAZING*. We had a party of 3, and did have a bit of a wait, but the way they seat people is actually entertaining in itself (you sign in on a board). Then once we were seated we ordered drinks, which came quickly (I suggest the Ace Perry Ale!) and wings as an appetizer with smoked Bleu cheese, which was SO GOOD. Wr all 3 got the Burnt Ends and other assorted meat. It was definitely awesome food, best chicken wings any of us have had, and the experience as a whole was GREAT! We will def be back!!!!", 
      "FINALLY returned and tried that burnt ends sandwich all the young people are talking about! \u00a0I loved it, and I'm not even a brisket person. \u00a0Very tender with just the right amount of crunch! \u00a0It was actually kind of miraculous that they hadn't run out, since I ordered them at 6:30 on a busy Friday night! \u00a0Fortune was smiling upon me, I guess.Our table also split the cornbread as an appetizer, which was just a little bit spicy (and meaty, of course). \u00a0Will other restaurants please jump on the savory cornbread train? \u00a0I am straight-up tired of eating over-sweetened cornbread that tastes more like cake. \u00a0Ugh. \u00a0My boyfriend and I split a beer flight, which is a fantastic deal: you are getting essentially 24 oz of beer for just $6. \u00a0And the little glasses all came out on a large wooden plate shaped like a dog bone! \u00a0Too adorable.The one not-so-good thing about our meal was the corn on the cob - it was mushy and flavorless and got stuck in our teeth! \u00a0I know this is a little early for corn season, but shit, we ARE in the middle of Illinois - you'd think they could get corn right! \u00a0Just stick with another side dish and you'll be fine."

      "Came here after my friends all raved about it. We arrived and there was a brief wait. I figured, hmmm...there are people here...that's a good sign. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Here's what I got:-combination platter with catfish, brisket, sweet potato fries, and double baked potatoes (for how much I paid I was expecting a larger portion; brisket was good; the catfish had an odd taste and odor - didn't really care for it; I had to pay extra for the sweet potato fries but it came with like 5 fries!! Grr. The twice baked potatoes were ok but suuuuuuper small cup of it)-burnt ends (DELISH)The food was a disappointment but the service was even worst! The server asked how the daiquiri was and my friend said it wasn't what she expected and he pounced on her interrogating her for why she didn't like it. IM SORRRY YOUR DRINKS AREN'T GOOD. You never attack the customer! So rude. He should've apologized and offered her another drink. Later he asked about the food and we mentioned the catfish and he had the same reaction! I was stunned. Overall, the food and service left much more to be desired...", 
      "Black Dog you are the top dog! \u00a0We came here after a game and fell on the food like hungry little puppies. \u00a0I had a ribs and burnt ends both of which were fabulous. \u00a0I also adored the twice baked potato casserole which I learned about from other Yelp reviews. \u00a0They even made another batch for us, how terrific!My only issue is that it is always crowded. \u00a0So I suggest that you double the size of the place or keep a table that is always available just for me. \u00a0Thanks!", 
      "What can I say that hasn't been said before? I met my boss here for lunch on a sunny Monday afternoon. We were quickly greeted by we had 2 more people yet to show up so we had to wait for them to be seated.As soon as our party was there, we were quickly ushered to a table and greeted by our server. He informed us that he had been overhearing our conversations at the table and was happy to report that they did have burnt ends and explained to one of my lunch mates what a mufelleta was and what it was made of today. This was a great touch - what an easy way to make a quick and easy impression on a table!So, I got my burnt ends sandwich, along with sweet potato fries - which I had been told were AMAZING. I also ordered their beans.We also ordered the cornbread... which was delish!!! I recommend it highly. It was moist, slightly spicy... and full of amazingness!The burnt end sandwich was increds. Cooked to perfection and flavored wonderfully with a Carolina Red sauce.The sweet potato fries weren't amazing - they were AH-MAY-ZING!!!!!The beans were delish as well - and did not need for me to add in any sauce or anything, which is my usual habit.I have to say... I have been coming to central Illinois for years and I am pissed it took until today for me to get to this place.I will be back... probably every trip to central Illinois!!!", 
      "After calling around to all the BBQ places in town, we decided to go with Black Dog for a catering event for 200-300 people. \u00a0We got 20 lb. pulled pork, 20 lb. pulled chicken, buns, sauce, potato salad and cole slaw. \u00a0They were absolutely fantastic to work with (for instance, offering pulled chicken even though that's not on their catering menu) and the price was the best around (compared to Famous Dave's, Blues, Lil Porgy's, and Hickory River). \u00a0The food was such a hit with the crowd that those of us working the event didn't get a chance to eat much of it, so we went back to Black Dog afterwards and got dinner! \u00a0The potato casserole is divine, the potato salad is spicy and delicious, and the meat is just phenomenal. \u00a0I've tried the Carolina Red and the Chipotle sauce, both of which were delicious.The restaurant itself is tiny and was packed on a Friday night, so while turnover is pretty fast, expect to wait 10-20 minutes if you come at a busy time. \u00a0The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and food comes out pretty fast, so no complaints there. \u00a0Prices are pretty standard--about $7 for sandwich and a side, $10-12 for a platter with 1-2 meats and 2 sides. \u00a0Definitely worth trying!", 
      "Black Dog is pretty tasty, although in my experience, they're still working otu the kinks, so you'll have to deal with their occasional running out of food you might like.Still, the drink selection is nice, and good God, the pulled pork was tasty. \u00a0The pit beans were phenomenal. \u00a0Personally, I'd recommend getting the coleslaw on the side--and then not eating it. \u00a0That wasn't so good, but everything else was.And sweet Mary and Joseph--CORNBREAD WITH MEAT IN IT.Yes. \u00a0UH. MAY. ZING.The wait staff is friendly and personable, and the food is top notch. \u00a0My only other complaint would be the lack of fried catfish 6 out of 7 days. \u00a0Oh, they have regular catfish, but it's only fried on Fridays. \u00a0And that just breaks my heart. \u00a0Because I LOVE fried catfishy. \u00a0DOn't judge me.Tasty, tasty catfish. Anyhow, Black Dog is worth a stop, they've definitely renovated and improved the former space, and the food is great.", 
      "This place is amazing on about 15 different levels. You literally can order anything on the menu, and it will be amazing. Obligatory praise due for the burnt ends (smokier, juicier cap of the brisket, with a crispy, burnt edge), pulled pork, and brisket. Of course, that's leaving out any one of the awesome burgers, the half chicken,ribs, and their awesome sides (pit beans or sweet potato fries for me...but regular fries, southwestern potato salad, twice baked casserole, and smoked sweet potato w/ brown sugar and butter...all ridiculously awesome).The red cabbage cole slaw, and any number of their homemade sauces (my favorite being the hot georgia peach) are outstanding compliments to the meat. and they're conscientious too. a few small price hikes to support grass fed, local beef, and the delightful free-range chicken. they even recycle, which I assure you most of the restaurants in town do not. Oh, and don't glaze over when you hear the specials. Burritos for lunch are insane, and don't get me started on the beef ribs. Slightly more labor intensive than the pork ribs (at risk of being redundant, also excellent), but a serious treat. Almost forgot to mention their amazing beverage selection. Not only is their beer selection fantastic (with the option for an affordable flight of craft beers), they have 1) an awesome whiskey selection 2) awesome bottled soft drinks...mexican coke and squirt (with sugar, not corn syrup), and a couple other tasty options. Alright, this post is getting annoyingly long. But this place is just too good. They deliver you an amazing product while being environmentally conscientious, and just overall nice guys. Lastly, I also might clarify a couple things that people have commented on, but are inaccurate.The platter vs. the sandwichplatter is twice the meat of a sandwich (in the case of brisket, pork, or ends), with two sides, and no bun. so it's not \"basically the same thing,\" it's twice as much of everything, without a bun.the beans don't come out of a microwave, they are smoked and then kept in a hotbox, which is very much not a microwave. plastic might still melt, but it didn't happen in a microwave.That is all.", 
      "I think your experience of the Black Dog's atmosphere is largely contingent upon what sorts of restaurants you've been to in the past and how you expect to be treated by the people who are serving you/cooking you food for the evening. If you tend to go out to restaurants like, say, Chili's or Friday's, where the servers are obligated to be saccharine to the point of nausea, then hey! you probably won't like The Black Dog's atmosphere because you'll think the servers, host or bartenders are rude for not falling all over themselves to do your bidding. I personally love the Black Dog, primarily for the food. If I had one complaint about the place it would be that it gets pretty cramped. Probably once a week I entertain the notion of going to eat here and have to decide against it because of how ridiculously busy it is. I know The Black Dog isn't hurting for business and I might even be doing them a favor by not going to dine with them on their busier evenings, but GOD, I love them so much. Why do you constantly rebuff my advances, Black Dog?The Black Dog is hands down one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I've loved everything I've tried on the menu thus far. \u00a0The portions are always more than enough, and the food is, frankly, under-priced for the amount and quality of food you get. The first time I went I expected to pay $15 an entree and was shocked to find it was far cheaper. Pay this place a visit, even if you have to wait 40 minutes to be seated. Worth it.", 
      "Okay, I've been to Black Dog twice so far. I was really excited before the first visit because of all the great reviews on Yelp, and I ended up being sadly disappointed in my dry beef brisket sandwich and slightly metallic-tasting pit beans (although being that I don't often come across foods that taste of metal, I wrote it off as a problem with my mouth that evening). This experience really struck me deeply...I'd never had an eating experience that contradicted so sharply with a Yelp consensus. Was something wrong with me? I began to feel quite gastronomically insecure.I gave it a second try recently, opting for a plate of rib tips along with an order of potato salad and corn on the cob. Again, a sunken heart. About half of the rib tips were great, while the other half were terribly dry and tough; I had to force myself to finish them. As for the sides, the corn on the cob was mushy and bland, but the spicy potato salad was pretty enjoyable. We threw a sampler beer flight into the mix, which was probably the best part of the meal (and a good value to boot, being that you net out at more beer for less money than most of the single glasses). I'm sorry to say that Black Dog is oh-for-two. Maybe I just had bad luck in picking the worst items on the menu or coming in on bad days, but now that I'm no longer living in the area (this was my last dinner in Chambana), it unfortunately may never have an opportunity to redeem itself again with me. Au revoir, dawg.", 
      "The best BBQ this side of the Mississippi... I'm not kidding, this stuff is amazing!Black Dog uses local farms in the majority of their meal production, and it definitely shows! \u00a0The food is fresh, reasonably priced, and finger lickin good, and comes complete with wet naps.Would have received 5 stars if not for the service... From start to finish, it's lackluster, at best. \u00a0The gentleman host seems checked out and by your presence, and the hipster staff follows suit. \u00a0At times, you feel as though you have to apologize for requiring them to do their job. \u00a0Not to mention that they're trying to push you out the door the minute you receive your entree. There are some exceptions to this (funny, tall hippy guy with great sense of humor, awesome short-haired lady cook, bald, heavily bearded bartender), but the more than few bad apples leave an unfortunate bad taste in your mouth.If you can get past the service and long waits, this place is amazing!", 
      "Yea, I feel dumb writing the 99th review... as if what I say about Black Dog will be more relevant or informative than the 98 before me... but might I say anyway:I live in Los Angeles, I'm here for the summer. \u00a0Not that LA is known for bbq, but neither is East Central Illinois, so I'll continue. \u00a0STILL, I eat at a barbecue/beer joint every week, more than once a week in Los Angeles and BLACK DOG makes me feel embarrassed that I spend $20 on a pulled pork sandwich, a beer and a tip at Blues BBQ in West Hollywood. \u00a06.95 for a burnt tips or ends or whatever sandwich AND a side [I had potato salad and dipped those spuds into every one of my sauce flight sauces]. \u00a0 \u00a0And like $4 for a glass of what our AWESOME, nice-sporty-but-down-to-earth-witty waiter \u00a0 \u00a0waiter called a REALLY nice PBR. \u00a0I got there at 11:00 and watched the place fill up to the point where we had to use a back exit to get a baby in a stroller and a 4-year-old out of the restaurant. \u00a0But they HAD A BACK DOOR and they let us use it which made us feel cool and made them look cool for being accommodating. \u00a0It probably wasn't even a secret door, but we felt grateful all the same. \u00a0The vegetarian 4-year-old happily ate an awesome looking provolone grilled sandwich, so Imma just put that out there in case your vegetarian self gets pulled along to Black Dog. \u00a0Nice-sporty-but-down-to-earth-witty waiter sampled us beer, gave me an extra sauce when I decided which one from my flight was the best [I liked Georgia Peach] and was really attentive despite a full-house at 11:30 a.m. I got out of there full-to-the-brim and more satisfied than I've been in awhile [good bbq paired with beer is a wonderful lover] for less than $12 [excluding the big ol' tip he deserved]. \u00a0Why is CU so great?? \u00a0If someone wanted the short version of what my BBQ at Black Dog experience was, I would yell: \u00a0\"LEGIT AS HELL.\" and hope that summed up the flava', waiter and atmosphere.", 
      "I felt like I was cheating as we drove by Hickory River, so I looked away. \u00a0Parking at Black Dog is sketchy - this time the lot was a sheet of ice. \u00a0But we got right in, only waiting 5 minutes for a table at 6pm.We split way too many apps, but everything looked so darn good!! \u00a0Smoked almonds (house smoked, with a touch of sweetness - love, especially for $3!), wings (expensive but OK, with sauce that catches up with you around wing #3), Texas caviar (with black eyed peas and hominy - very nice) and chips and salsa (meh). \u00a0Drinks all around too. \u00a0I had a bloody mary made with horseradish vodka (yum) and a margarita made with hoppy tequila (yum!!!).I ordered a combo plate. \u00a0$12 for your choice of two meats (I had burnt ends and pulled pork) and two sides (spicy potato salad and pit beans - both delish). \u00a0Really good amount of food for the price! \u00a0Others at my table had the brisket (dry), sweet potato fries (an upcharge but very worth it if you're a fan of them), the burger with brisket, sauce, onions and cheese on it (she loved it) and the twice-baked potato casserole (everyone wanted to lick this bowl clean).This was my first time trying burnt ends, and I must say I was disappointed. \u00a0I expected blackened meat all around, like I've seen on the Food Network, and these were just the black ring around brisket that I normally get... when I order brisket.We all loved the potato salad and the potato casserole. \u00a0In fact, we loved all the sides and apps. \u00a0If there was a way to get just a plate of sides, I'd never leave.Hopping place! \u00a0A constant waiting line, on a Tuesday. \u00a0Good service, but a little scatterbrained.", 
      "The four stars is because of the food, I really like barbecue and theirs was smoky good. \u00a0I had the ribs and pulled pork and both were great. \u00a0My side of Mac n Cheese was also very very good.But I am going to dog on Black dog for the place itself. \u00a0The food was fairly expensive yet you are in a physically uncomfortable environment. \u00a0If it's a bar, why are they serving such good food? \u00a0If it's a restaurant why are the seats and tables so crappy? \u00a0Plus the lines are really long, would bar patrons want to wait that long? \u00a0And if they are there for a bar aren't they going to take up seats for a long time so people can't eat?I like the food but the concept seems pretty conflicted. \u00a0Work it out, be a bar or a restaurant and accommodate one set of customers. \u00a0I hope it's the restaurant with new seating. \u00a0Arf arf.", 
      "I often frequent Black Dog for lunches away from work. They can get really busy and have very little seating, which is off-putting for some, but I don't mind it. I LOVE the cornbread with chilis and pulled pork in it, but it's not for everyone. Their BBQ sauces are awesome! I could eat a shoe if it was dipped in some Hot Georgia Peach. Their smoked turkey is amazing - which surprised me because I hate turkey but had to try it when I was drooling over someone else's meal. I've tried most proteins on the menu and sandwiches - I've never been let down. Only once have a thought the meat was a little skimpy, but it's not like I left hungry. I've been very happy with the service every time I've come as well. Everybody I've encountered has been friendly and that only adds to the dining experience.", 
      "Meh, I've experienced better. Certainly not a place I'd go for a relaxing dining experience. Went on a Thursday night, and was ushered in to two seats at the end of the bar by the hostess. The bartender/server was nice and was around enough to take our order, and the service was very efficient, almost too efficient. I certainly felt rushed to order, eat my food, pay my bill, and leave so the people waiting could eat. I've been to much busier BBQ places like Oklahoma Joes in Kansas City that operates a similar size joint \u00a0out of a gas station and it's all self seating, and although most people won't sit there all day while others wait, they don't hurry you out after you've waiting your turn in line. I probably still had half my food on my plate when I was asked \"are you all done with that?\"... seriously? As for the food, I ordered the cornbread appetizer, and the pork inside was a interesting touch, which I liked. Before we could finish our cornbread the food was already served. I got the pulled pork/brisket combo with twice baked casserole and slaw. The sides were pretty good, though my GF's potato salad had zero flavor. The meat was nothing special. Yes, it was tender, but the pulled pork almost looked roasted rather than smoked, and having an ice cream scoop shaped pork was kinda odd. \u00a0The house sauce was what really killed it for me. I really couldn't put my finger on what I don't like about it but the sweet, smoky, kick it has just doesn't do anything for me but overpower the flavor of the meat. And like everyone else says, the place is packed and cramped all the time. If this place is so great then they should give the customer a good overall dining experience and not just rely on their food. I'll try going back again sometime, and who knows I may hit the lottery and be able to get their seemingly impossible to get burnt ends.", 
      "I love the food but I really don't like the snooty help! I went to black dog to get takeout and sat down at the bar. I have always been told the bar is first come first serve. The bartender asked me what I wanted and I said I just wanted to order take out. He told me that he thought the waitress was going to sit some people where I was sitting and told me to come down to the area where orders are picked up. First problem, I am a paying customer and it was busy. Second problem, it's a bunch of crap to direct a paying customer to stand for 15+ minutes. Third problem, I like the food but I don't love it and I can certainly go without the unneeded crap from the bartender not to mention the attitude from a waitress that we are the best. Even if a restaurant is the best being condescending and arrogant will keep me from coming back!!!!", 
      "Um, I'm not quite sure how I haven't reviewed this place yet. I'm a BBQ junkie. I've had it all over the country, from the dry rub of Memphis to the vinegar based sauces of North Carolina to the beef ribs of Texas. I'm not an expert, but I do know what tastes good.Black Dog tastes good.I've had the burnt tips (in my opinion, the burnt ends of food are always the best) and the brisket, and both were succulent. A huge plus for me is that the food doesn't come drenched in sauce. That way you can actually taste the meat and the rub and get a true feel for the barbecue. I love the baked beans, mainly because they have little pieces of pork in them. The fries are nice and crispy, which I love. After coming from a hard workout, I was able to demolish the combo platter with a slightly too full feeling, so it's a lot of food. Normally I can't eat that much. I still haven't bought ribs, so that's the next thing to try.Because of the hype around this place, the service is not always the best. It's small and a bit cramped as well. This is why it only gets 4 stars. I wonder if they'll have a patio this summer, because honestly I can think of nothing better than a plate of barbecue, warm weather, and cold beer.", 
      "I took some out of town family members here for lunch this past Sunday. It was crowded, yes. A lot of people look at the line and immediately turn around. Keep in mind, there isn't a lot of room to stand indoors and wait for tables. It's a pretty small place, but the wait is WORTH it!We started with the burnt ends. If you don't go early, you won't get them. They run out quickly (there's only so many of them since they come off the brisket). They melt in your mouth. They are ridiculously delicious. We also split the smoked wings. The sauce they put on them seems to be a spiced up version of their Carolina Red sauce. They were awesome.For entrees we had quite a mix. The salmon was great. I even tried the beet salad with goat cheese. Not a normal menu item. I should say that I can't stand beets normally. These were good and I kept sneaking bites of my husband's! The brisket was perfect as was the smoked Polish. My dad loved his catfish, too. What really made the meal was our server Matthis (spelling? Sorry if it's wrong). He was funny, friendly and fast. Our drinks were never empty and he seemed to really care that we were happy. I wish it wasn't always so busy. I guess it's because the food is so delicious. Like I said though, it's worth the wait. Thanks to everyone there for a great lunch!", 
      "I'm learning that it's unfair to compare BBQ joints to Smoque and Lem's. That being said Black Dog is on par with County Line BBQ. I tried a little bit of everything. Only the cornbread & the smoked wings stood out as exceptional. Wings were cooked perfectly tender and had a nice spice rub. \u00a0The ribs were just ok. Fairly tender, but didn't live up to the hype. The brisket was terrible. Dry, bland definitely not tender. Pulled pork was also dry and flavorless. I'll probably stop by again, but only for the wings.", 
      "I'm a long-time lurker, first-time writer.We went to Black Dog last night at 8:00pm after hearing rave reviews on two local blogs (you probably can guess which ones.)Well, we stood by the door for a good 5 to 7 minutes politely waiting with absolutely no one giving us a blink of attention. We saw people in booths and tables with food and drinks, waited on by a woman, and at least two people standing around behind the bar. They were not busy.Finally tiring of this exercise we seated ourselves at the bar uninvited. The bartender came by and told us they were basically out of food. No ribs, no pulled pork, no chicken, nothing.I can understand their under-estimating demand given that they haven't been open that long. (Although, if you start serving ribs at 5pm, you only have something like 5 booths and 4 tables, and you're out by 8pm -- huh?)But if someone had told us there were out when we came in, it wouldn't be a problem. Letting customers just stand around stupidly is ridiculous. I'm sorry, no food is so good to suffer so much attitude. I felt like I was in a snooty restaurant in Paris.No thanks. We went down the street to Seven Saints and had a nice dinner with friendly service.", 
      "Hands down the best restaurant in Champaign. \u00a0Really. \u00a0Every regular menu item is fantastic (the pork, the brisket, the polish, catfish, etc. etc. etc.) \u00a0The bbq sauces are amazing as well. Personally I like the chipotle, its spicy and amazing. \u00a0The carolina red is great as well with a nice kick, and the hot georgia peach is an awesome combo of sweet and spicy. \u00a0If it were just for this it would already be 5 stars. \u00a0But it isn't just this.The specials might be even better than the regular bbq. \u00a0The cuban is the best cuban I've ever had. \u00a0The pastrami is the best pastrami I've ever had. \u00a0The new turkey club (twice a week) is THE BEST turkey sandwich I've ever had. \u00a0The fried cod on Friday might be the best sandwich all week. \u00a0 Finally, the tacos and burritos here can stand up to Maize any day.And then there's the beer. \u00a0Different craft beers every time you go in there. \u00a0Place is just awesome.", 
      "Can't rave enough about how good the food is here. \u00a0Tried the smoked polish for a change and DAMN! \u00a0perfection; had no idea a sausage could be so tasty.The quality and variety on the ever-changing beer sampler flight holds me in thrall to the awesomeness that is Black Dog. \u00a0They continue to seem busier every time we return. \u00a0Still run out of stuff- once again scored one of the last burnt ends portions.And, yes, I actually eat here way more often than I yelp it. \u00a0I know, right? \u00a0If I could only eat one place in Urbanabannana for the rest of my time here- it'd probly be here.A tiny blond sorority type was asking about vegetarian options. \u00a0Umm, sorry sweetie, have your boyfriend run you up-street to Courier. \u00a0The waitress was all \"well, our fries are vegetarian, and we could fix you a grilled cheese.\" \u00a0Mwahahaha.", 
      "We are always looking for a new place in the Chambana area during football season and somehow Black Dog had eluded us. \u00a0Luckily I ran into a friend who opened our eyes. \u00a0We went to the ASU night game and after a long night of cheering we were hungry! \u00a0We arrived around 9:30 / 10:00 pm and the place was still pretty full. \u00a0When we sat down the server announced that they were out of quite a few menu items. \u00a0We weren't shy about our disappointment and a little bit later the server told us they were going to make more of the twice baked potato casserole. \u00a0Hooray! \u00a0Oh and they were DELICIOUS!Everything was so good. \u00a0The bbq has more of a smoked flavor which I really like. \u00a0I ordered the pulled pork with the house sauce. \u00a0The sauce was a bit spicy (I am a wimp) but I did sample some others that I liked. \u00a0I can't wait to go back to try some burnt ends and some other sauces.", 
      "Plenty of positive detailed reviews here already. \u00a0First timer. Stopped by on way back from Danville Il for dinner Fri around 5:45p. \u00a0Seemed like a good time to get a table. \u00a0Last \u00a0time we tried the wait at Lunch was ridiculous. \u00a0The ribs were outstanding and tons of interesting sauces to choose from. \u00a0Recommend the flight of sauces for $2. \u00a0Enough for the whole table. \u00a0The corn bread is simply the best I have ever had. \u00a0So dense. \u00a0Yum. \u00a0Oh and the Bloody Mary made with tequila and the Pineapple margarita were awesome. \u00a0Wish this place was closer!", 
      "Who would have thought that Champaign, Illinois can put out the best barbecue? You lucky UIUC kids, I'm jealous!Last September, I went to Black Dog for the first time on a double date. We had a 40-minute wait but time flew by in their awesome draft beer selection. They ran out of the famous burnt ends (meat cut from the point half of a smoked brisket) by the time we sat down, but everything else was delicious so I promised myself to go back. And I did, 3 times! It has become a tradition for my boyfriend and me. The quality of their food and beer is amazingly consistent.The burnt ends turned out to be perfectly charred, moist and smokey. On top of that, their hot polish and chicken are just mind blowing. I never pick chicken over beef/pork at bbq places, until I reached my fork into my friend's Black Dog chicken platter :P But tonight, we got another surprise...Smoke Duck Special, which has now made Thursday night the best night! Both the duck and the chicken are worth trying. They not too greasy and deliciously spiced.Last but not least, I have fallen in love with their sides and bbq sauces. You can't go wrong with the sweet potato fries and the vinegar based slaw, also, the cornbread has BRISKET in it! I know the bbq sauce variety does not help your decision making. If you like something with a little \"zing\" or \"kick\", I suggest the Hot Georgia Peach and the mustard.", 
      "Best smoked meat anywhere. I've had smoked meat all over the US and this place has topped all! I stop in every chance I can.", 
      "Their pulled pork is DIVINE, very tender and sauced to perfection. \u00a0They butter their buns and add some 'slaw in the sandwich. \u00a0I gladly had it twice in 3 days. \u00a0Like Goldilocks who found the perfect bbq... not too spicy, not too dry, perfectly tangy, the meat was juicy, everything was just right. \u00a0And that's why I keep going back.It's located in an unsuspecting, little brick building but it's packed at meal times throughout the week no matter what day. \u00a0They have random pieces of art on the wall I mistakenly took for coat hangers... \u00a0but the servers are pretty good at seating you and there's a great atmosphere. \u00a0Clients licking their fingers, loving their food, and servers knowing their food is prized. \u00a0Don't waste your time on the spicy potato salad, but pair your meal with sweet tea, sweet potato fries or amazing smoked beans. \u00a0They don't joke around with their smoked flavor. \u00a0I have never tasted such 'smokiness' ever.They ran out of brisket and the pulled chicken, but i guess that's what happens when everything tastes like home-cooked goodness. \u00a0I'll be back very soon to try their rib tips and wings.", 
      "I've eaten here a few times and while I've never been blown away, I was never disappointed either. I got exactly what I was looking for--quality BBQ with homemade sides. It was a plus that it carried all sorta of craft beers as well. Wait time were long however which is the main reason I always decide against going into urbana to eat here.", 
      "Mmmmmm. I'm insanely thankful for this place, because now when my parents come to town, my brother can suggest a BBQ place that isn't Famous Dave's. Burnt ends = heaven on a sandwich. I got the cole slaw and sauce on the side so I could enjoy the smoky meat on its own with the occasional dip into the bbq sauce... The fries were nothing special, but also good dipped in bbq. The place is a little small and cramped, but that's part of the charm, and you just know a place is going to be good when you walk into a packed restaurant.Minus one star because we sat at our table for 5-10 minutes before a waitress came by and said \"Oh, did you need menus?\"", 
      "Love this place! \u00a0Great food -- always busy (get there right at 11 or after 1, then right at 5 but after 7 to avoid the lunch/dinner rush -- otherwise you'll be standing in a long line) \u00a0BUT I have a few issues:1. \u00a0It's kid friendly only if your kid can sit by himself in a chair. \u00a0 There are no high chairs in this place -- probably because the tables and booths are fairly high (booths are on risers, tables are tall bar tables) so you either have to tag team with another person in your party to hold your kid while the other eats OR bring your own portable high chair that attaches to one of the booths OR hire a babysitter and have a parents' night out.2. \u00a0Prices. \u00a0 Prices are fairly reasonable considering all the food is local, but some of the specials seem a little bit over-priced. \u00a0 I mean, Monday's they have a Chicago style hot dog.... $6.95 for a hot dog seems pretty steep. \u00a0As well as the beef stroganoff....we ordered a takeout order of this and it came in one of those small takeout soup containers. \u00a0It rang in to around $11.95 if I'm not mistaken.... YIKES. \u00a0 I would stick with the sandwiches for $6.95 with one side. \u00a0A platter is $11.95 -- basically the same thing (minus the bun) + two sides. \u00a0 The price jump from a sandwich to a platter doesn't seem worth it to me.Those are my two issues. \u00a0We eat here at least once a week and I LOVE the pulled pork sandwich, the Cuban sandwich, and the burnt end sandwich (although the last couple times I had it, it was dry). \u00a0My side of choice is either the potato salad (to die for!) or a side salad (all local,fresh vegetables....so refreshing!!!).UPDATE: \u00a0they now have highchairs! \u00a0The kind that attach to the table. \u00a0We actually bought a Phil and Ted portable high chair to specifically bring with us to BD, but they beat us to it.... \u00a0So now i only have the one issue about their prices. \u00a0BTW -- their smoked chicken is WONDERFUL as well as their pit beans. \u00a0 If you're wondering what to feed your 10 month old baby, try little bits of chicken, pulled pork, the sweet potato and some beans!", 
      "I've been to Black Dog two times now, and have been pleasantly surprised both times. \u00a0My coworkers had told me about this place and everyone had ranting about how amazing it was. \u00a0Given that I love good barbecue, I knew I had to check it out, so when a buddy of mine got dumped by his fiancee, I knew exactly what he needed--beer and barbecue from Black Dog.The first time I went, I had a pulled-pork sandwich with fries and a beer. \u00a0I had the standard red sauce, which was tangy and delicious. \u00a0The pork was juicy and flavorful. \u00a0The bun was large and tasty. \u00a0They put coleslaw on their pulled pork sandwiches, which I probably would have asked them not to put on it had I known, but I decided to give it a shot since it came that way, and I was pleasantly surprised at how it added to the experience. \u00a0The fries were good steak fries--fairly standard fare for such a place. \u00a0It's hard to mess up fries.The second time I went was with a large group of people (~12), which given the size of the place, proved to be a bit of a chore. \u00a0Part of the group had to sit in a booth, while the rest occupied the high tables.I ordered a full rack of ribs with potato salad and sweet potato fries on the side. \u00a0Sweet potato fries are always great, but because of the sugar content seldom reach a decent level of crispiness. \u00a0These were adequately crispy and very flavorful and had brown sugar on them, adding a nice touch. \u00a0The potato salad had something spicy in it, which gave it a nice, unique kick. \u00a0The ribs were fantastic, and having been there, I really wouldn't recommend anywhere else in town for ribs. \u00a0They had clearly been cooked a long time and seemingly without boiling. \u00a0The edges were crispy and flavorful and the insides were tender and juicy. \u00a0I ordered the same sauce I had ordered the first time I visited, which once again, was tangy, sweet, and delicious.The atmosphere was good--pretty laid back, somewhat cozy and down-to-earth while still maintaining a sense of rustic class. \u00a0The layout prevents the gathering of particularly large groups, which is not surprising for a place that size. \u00a0It was worth splitting the group a bit to go there.", 
      "I've eaten at Black Dog a few times now and have tried a number of things off their menu. \u00a0Among the choices, one of my favorites is the pulled pork sandwich with their signature sauce. \u00a0The pork has plenty of smoky flavor but it is not overwhelming while the sauce has a slight tang and complements the meat well. \u00a0I recently tried the pulled chicken sandwich and found it was just as good if not better than the pork. \u00a0Outside of main entrees, the sweet potato fries are fantastic as is the corn bread. \u00a0One thing to note about the sandwiches is that they all come with cole slaw on top unless you specifically ask otherwise.As others have noted, there is not a lot of seating in the restaurant and if you happen to visit during a busy time you may end up waiting for a while. \u00a0Also, given the tight quarters, there isn't much standing room while waiting so things can get cramped rather quickly. \u00a0If you want to try Black Dog's food without waiting for a seat, they do offer carry out which is extremely quick.", 
      "Best barbeque around. Meat is smoked perfectly! I also like that you get to choose what style bbq sauce to have. I'm not much of a Carolina vinegary sauce person, so I reallllly like the Georgia Peach sauce and the Texas sauce. Be sure to get there around 5- thats when their burnt ends and smoked sweet potatoes are ready. But don't get there too late or it'll be packed and they might run out of them. Which I guess is alright cause they have so much other good meat. Their pulled pork is amazing, and so is their brisket. The older guy who seats you sometimes is a mood killer though, that's all I'll say. Expect a wait- you can't call ahead or anything which is a bummer, but it's well worth the wait.", 
      "I've heard so much about how great Black Dog is, and finally got a chance to try it this past weekend. \u00a0Having heard that the burnt ends sell out quickly, my friends and I got there at 5 (apparently the have a batch of burnt ends at 11 AM and 5 PM) to a minimal line, and got seated after about 10 minutes of waiting. \u00a0As good as everything on the menu sounded, I knew I had to have the burnt ends, so I ordered a burnt ends sandwich.I took my first bite of my burnt ends sandwich and instantly the only things I could think were, \"Oh my god this is amazing\" and \"What have I been doing the last four years of my life?\". \u00a0The burnt ends had a delicious smoke flavor which were complemented very well by the Carolina Red BBQ sauce, which has a slight bit of heat. \u00a0I also enjoyed the soft cornmeal dusted bun that the meat came on. \u00a0I found this sandwich to go really well with the draft Arrogant Bastard that I had. \u00a0For my side I had the regular fries, which were good, but nothing extraordinary. \u00a0The burnt ends were the true standout here. \u00a0It's a shame I didn't come here before I ended up graduating, but I guess I avoided gaining 10 pounds from eating here all the time if I did.", 
      "OMG! Is definitely in order!!!!To start the beer selection is awesome!Got a combo plate. The brisket was awesome, the pulled pork is fantastic and the burnt ends are so orgasmic!The fries are good and loved the slaw!Even better yet, for $2 you can get a fleet of sauces so a person can taste it all. It was so good I haven't made my mind up as I will go back again and again and again!!!!!", 
      "I visited this place on a Saturday afternoon and a very hot summer day. \u00a0It wasn't too busy, so we got seated quickly. \u00a0However, it was sweltering in there. \u00a0Their A/C just couldn't combat the heat from cooking, so we were literally sweating the entire time. \u00a0It is also very cramped in there if you are at a table and not a booth. The server was quite rude---it was our first time there and we had to ask about the sauces. \u00a0She seemed really put out by having to answer questions. \u00a0She never smiled, seemed miserable, plunked down our food, and generally made us feel completely unwelcome. \u00a0The food was good, but not remarkable. \u00a0I know others on this site rave about it, but I was personally under-impressed. \u00a0I have had my share of BBQ and enjoyed it just fine. \u00a0However, the atmosphere and service ruined the experience for me. \u00a0I suppose if you order take-out it would be better. \u00a0Don't think I'll go back even for that, though.", 
      "Black Dog is probably one of my five favorite places in the country. I'm partial to the pulled pork and the twice baked for the side, but everything is good....if I'm feeling really saucy I'll get the Carolina Burger, which is a burger with pulled pork on it. That's right. I love they're constantly rotating beers, and offer flights for you to try. Yeah, it's always busy and the place is small. It's busy because it's the best.", 
      "Darn it! Why there is nothing like this place in my town? I'm just jealous with UIUC kids. I got there, it was packed so my friends and I have to wait around 15-20 minutes, I'll accept that. Sat down and we ordered the famous burnt ends (TWICE!), sweet potato fries and ribs. Ordered the beers and as a moderate fan of beer, I'll have to say that they have the right beer in stock. Food came, I have to keep myself not to swallow the food because OMG everything was delicious! Especially the burnt ends, it just melts above your tongue and that is why we ordered it twice. Place is always packed but hey, the wait will always be worth it!", 
      "I, like everyone else, have a hard time finding anything bad to say about this place.I almost always get the beef brisket and a beer, but their pulled pork, chicken, and polish are amazing, as well. \u00a0One visit, they had pozole, which was pretty damn good. \u00a0The sweet potato fries are a must, but every other side I've tried is amazing, too: pit beans, regular fries, baked potato casserole, and on and on.It's got a very casual vibe that I like, but it's also not so casual that it's trashy. \u00a0There's often local abstract art on the walls, but there's also a huge jug of tequila and pineapple on top of the fridge. \u00a0So, there's a desirable balance.Since this place now has a rep, lunch and dinner times are sometimes kind of crazy. \u00a0If you can hit it around 3 p.m. during the week, you usually won't have to wait for a table.The prices are fair, as long as you don't go too nuts with the beer.", 
      "If I could, I would eat here every day. Here are some pointers in case you want a taste of heaven.- Don't pass up the sweet potato fries- Dine in, it's worth the wait - you'll leave smelling like BBQ and they'll overload your tray with fries- Ask to try other sauces - they're more than willing to accommodate your curious taste buds- Get 2 orders of their pork belly special on Saturdays, cause they're closed on Sundays- Its hard for me to order anything else but burnt ends- Seating is limited...VERY limited- Go for late lunch or early dinner, otherwise you'll find yourself in a line out the door- TRY THE CORN BREAD. Best corn bread I've ever had - cheese and pulled pork baked into it! My mom doesn't let me come into the house unless I bring her at least 4 orders of this stuff when I come home from school.", 
      "I'm skeptical of suggestions.Really, it's more I don't know you, you don't know me, how do you know what I might enjoy or have a taste for?In this case I'm glad I put aside my thoughts on the matter, followed the bartender's suggestion and got the Burnt Ends. \u00a0Speaking of which, you don't know me and I don't know you but you should get it. \u00a0Really. \u00a0It's an awesome smoked and resmoked brisket sandwich that is so many layers of delicious, it's stupid. \u00a0It's juicy, flavorful and the sauce is done just right; present but not overwhelming. \u00a0The slaw is a correctly done supporting cast in the sandwich. \u00a0Also, coming it at around $7, it was easily tastier than more expensive crap I've paid for out here on the West Coast.Combine this hunger inducing (and curing) sandwich with a delightful Dark Horse Tres Blueberry Stout enjoyed on draft (not to mention the availability of a number of craft beers on draft and in bottle) and the chill atmosphere and I was more than happy I braved the rain to visit this spot before heading back to Chicago.Even if it wasn't in Urbana, this place would be able to hang in any big city either as just a beer bar or as a BBQ place. \u00a0I'll thank my lucky stars it does both."

      "Finally was able to come back to try out their dinner menu. Got the Combo Platter, 1/3 slab of ribs and 1/2 a chicken and two sides for 10.95, can't be beat. (They only serve these after 5pm). The ribs were pretty tender with a nice smokey char on the outside and the chicken was soft, mostly cuz it was dark meat but it also had a distinct smoked flavor that reminded me of lil porgies. They don't give you enough sauce to cover both of them, but they'll give you more if you just ask.The red cabbage coleslaw was a little too sour for me, but boy...the sweet potatoe fries are pretty awesome, I couldn't get enough of them!! Sweet, crunchy, potatoey...with a little bit of that sauce...ooo...i'm drooling right now and it's morning.Now I can confidently say that it's one of the better places on campus for bbq and I'll be coming back for their full rack of ribs in the next week or two.", 
      "This might be the best barbecue that I have had in the Midwest. I'm straining my brain to think of better. I spent three years in Texas where I became a real lover of all things barbecue. Black Dog knocked my socks off.We started with chicken wings. They arrived too hot to touch and glazed in the house standard Carolina BBQ sauce. They were great. Then we shared two combination platters which included brisket, sausage, pulled pork, ribs, twice baked potatoes, slaw, pit beans and sweet potato fries. We had a flight of BBQ sauces which included Carolina, Texas Georgia peach hot and mild, chipotle, Milo's mustard and a vinegar. Get the flight. The diversity of the sauces is half the fun.Keep in mind that you are in a college town and the atmosphere is busy, bustling and full of college kids. I enjoyed it, and actually prefer it over a faux-texan theme with a bunch of cowboy junk on the walls.Great beer selection also. I'll be back next time I'm in Urbana.", 
      "What we ordered:Pulled Pork Sandwich w/ their house Carolina Style BBQ sauce w/ slaw on the sideBrisket Sandwich w/ house BBQ sauce w/ slaw on top (traditional way)Sides: Cornbread, Baked Beans, Spicy Potato SaladThe meat is tender and flavorful - I preferred the pork, my husband preferred the brisket. The sauce was very good- definitely homemade, not the HFCS stuff from the bottle. It's not as sweet as the thick and dark styles, but its delicious, with a bit of heat. The slaw is is vinegar, not mayo-based and mine was fresh and crisp. The cornbread was delicious- the description says it has chilies, beans, and meat in it, and I was imagining something with big chunks or almost like a baked sandwich- when it arrived it looked like a piece of thick cornbread, but when you bit into it the flavor was salty and smoky with just a hint of chile flavor- no discernible pieces of beans/meat. The potato salad was good, but not the best I've had. The baked beans were delicious, with a definite smokiness, NOT the sweet stuff you're used to from pot lucks or the can!Delicious BBQ!", 
      "I ordered the beef ribs, which were the special.And then I saw the Cuban sandwich go by and I thought, \"oops, should have ordered that instead.\"And then I got my ribs and I thought, \"No, I'm glad I got these.\"But I would for sure try the Cuban next time!This place was packed on a Wednesday night, with a steady stream of carryout orders going out the door. The only thing I didn't love was that the bar has sort of a wide lip on the edge that forces you to really lean into it to get your food. Not a huge deal, but a minor inconvenience.", 
      "We arrived late, for this part of the world (around 9:00 pm), so they had run out of the \"burnt ends.\" \u00a0Carolyn ordered a portobella mushroom sandwich and reported that it was pretty good. \u00a0I went straight for the 1/2 slab of ribs, fries and beans. \u00a0Everything was lip smackin' good. \u00a0The ribs were a tad overcooked, but with the hot peach BBQ sauce, they tasted rather good.The fries were among the best I've had. \u00a0That good. \u00a0I'd go back just to order fires.The service, at the bar, was very good and the atmosphere just what you'd expected. \u00a0Recommended.",

I do remember being rather satisfied with the trip and the food overallTwice baked potato casserole - also February 2013, basically tastes like the inside of a twice baked potato, which is to say, pretty goodPolish sausage - rather good for what it is, and grows on you throughout the sandwich.

      "A lot of my reviews lately have been negative. \u00a0Have I just become too picky? \u00a0Are my standards too high?When I start wondering that, it's time to go to Black Dog. \u00a0This place is amazing. \u00a0I've been there many times, with many people. \u00a0Virtually everyone has been impressed. \u00a0The sauces are good, the meat is wonderful, and the specials are interesting. \u00a0If you are a beer fan (I am) they consistently have interesting beer in a variety of styles. \u00a0The taps rotate very frequently, so it's almost always a different set of choices when you go. \u00a0They also get some limited release stuff, like cask-aged beers. \u00a0It's awesome. \u00a0I'm not as much a cocktail drinker, but they also have their own infused liquors and cocktails made with them. \u00a0I think the sandwiches are the best deal, and they are consistently great. \u00a0Tender pulled pork, the always-in-demand and frequently out of stock burnt ends, and delicious brisket. \u00a0You can also get the meat on top of a burger for a decadent and delicious treat. \u00a0And the sides are all good too! \u00a0Potato salad with actual flavor instead of just mayonnaise! \u00a0The best sweet potato fries I've ever had! \u00a0The platters seem like you maybe get a bit less food per dollar, but they're still good. \u00a0I still have to give the nod to Lil Porgies for ribs, overall, but Black Dog is king for sandwiches.Specials include things like smoked salmon, muffaleta sandwiches, and burritos or tacos. \u00a0They've had a couple charity nights with homemade ramen. \u00a0If you see one of \u00a0these and you like ramen at all - go. \u00a0This is the closest to real Japanese ramen I've had, with awesome barbecue twists like a hard boiled egg that's been smoked and is still, somehow, gooey in the middle. \u00a0Absolutely wonderful.The downside? \u00a0Black Dog is so good there's often a line. \u00a0It's not a huge place. \u00a0It wouldn't be good at all for a group of more than 6 people. \u00a0And waits of 30 minutes or more are not uncommon. \u00a0Don't be surprised by that - this isn't the place to go for a quick bite. \u00a0(Though they do offer take-out.) \u00a0 Overall? \u00a0Black Dog is really, really good. \u00a0It makes you feel good to eat here. \u00a0If you like barbecue at all - especially Carolina style - you should go here. \u00a0Yes, there will probably be a wait - because the secret's out.", 
      "Named after the owners' two dogs: Oscar and Lola...Black Dog has officially opened. Finally! A lip-smackin' smoke house with a more than decent beer menu...offering a cozy warm environment too!They offer VERY reasonably priced sandwiches for $6-$10: pulled pork, catfish, chicken, brisket, polish and more! They also buy wheels of goat cheese (specially made just for Black Dog) and blue cheese from the local Prairie Fruits Farm and smoke it. Damnit..this place is perfect. After 5 p.m., pork spare ribs are not only to die for, but very affordable, and need no sauce. Score a full slab for $15 to boot!", 
      "Never had something I didn't like from here. Decent beer selection, great food, and cozy atmosphere. The service is great and you can tell by the lines you see outside on any given night that its the best BBQ in town. Get there early, before the burnt ends are gone!My suggestion: They have a bacon bleu (I think?) burger that goes great with the Georgia peach bbq sauce and sweet potato fries!", 
      "My friend and I went here for dinner tonight-- we both had delicious beers-- the scotch ale for me, and the wheat for him. \u00a0Both were great, the waitress was very nice and prompt, and the food was absolutely delicious. \u00a0I had the pulled pork, and it melted in my mouth. \u00a0Plus, sweet potato fries were only $.50 extra, compared to the $1.50 extra they are at crane alley. \u00a0They have a great beer selection, and you can smell the place like a block away... the sweet, sweet smell of gluttony (and I'm sure most of the other 7 deadly sins)... and it's great.All in all, 2 sandwiches, 3 beers, 20% tip and all under $30? Good in my book!", 
      "NOM!This place has great food, hands down. I have been here on two occasions now and both times it has made my heart sing. The flavors are exquisite.You get to pick your own sauce, which is great, and they'll bring you a sample if you're not sure you're going to enjoy one but you think... well, maybe...Get the burnt ends. While everything I've tried has been good, the burnt ends are the best thing on the menu. What they did to that meat is... beautiful, artistic, completely wonderful, simultaneously sinful and heavenly. Go here. For sure.", 
      "The food is DIVINE and reasonably priced. However, their place is much too small for the business that they do. I had to wait over half an hour just for a seat at the bar, and I felt rushed to finish/leave due to the number of peeps waiting behind me, not exactly ideal dining conditions. I don't think that I'll be back on a Friday or Saturday, ever; go during the middle of the week.", 
      "This place is awesome, I go crazy whenever I see NC-style barbecue (see hometown).Went here on friday with some friends, it was small and packed but we only had to wait by the door 5-10 min. \u00a0Sat at the bar and got the beer menu, they have a fantastic selection of really good beer for cheaper prices than you'd find at any other bar. \u00a0Then it was a choice between the ribs, half chicken, catfish, and pulled pork (pulled pork !!!). \u00a0I had to get the ribs, which were dry rubbed, smoked, and came with the perfect vinegar-y sauce. \u00a0The sides are just as delicious, one of my friends fell so in love with his baked beans that he's been talking about them for the past two days. \u00a0Looks like they also do breakfast/brunch, that'll be next on my list to try.", 
      "Seriously the best BBQ in the area. \u00a0I like the pulled pork best. \u00a0I have also had the brisket, but it was a little too smoky for me. \u00a0I didn't even think that was possible, but it was. \u00a0Chips and salsa are spot on. \u00a0You wouldn't think to order them at a BBQ place, but definitely do, they are well worth it.Hands down favorite thing at this place: cornbread! \u00a0It comes out all warm and goey. \u00a0It has pork and whole bunch of other stuff in it that make it extra special. \u00a0The prices are unbeatable too. \u00a0Dinner for two, I'd be shocked if you spent more than $30 total with drinks. \u00a0I've heard the wait can be bad, but I was there on a Saturday night at 7pm and only waited maybe 10 minutes. \u00a0It was so good though I would wait much longer!Highly recommended!", 
      "Such a hidden gem in Urbana for college students because every time I rave about this place to someone they were unfortunate to not have the black dog experience. First off, the BBQ sandwiches (I've tried them all) are all phenomenal! If you're a BBQ person there should be no reason for you to not try this place.As a first timer, definitely try to get there early to get the burnt ends! They only have limited amounts made and the burnt ends do run out very quickly. Also, pay the extra 50 cents and get the sweet potato fries, honestly it will be the only place around the area that serve them and it is definitely a fresh new taste compared to the typical fries! I don't like sweet potatoes but these fries were worth trying!My friends and I also got the wings as an appetizer once and I always order them now since they were so good! It comes with lots of meat & good flavor so get them to share so you have plenty of room for their entreePLEASE don't pass this place up! I've taken many friends here and they have never been disappointed!!!", 
      "The best BBQ in Champaign-Urbana, hands down. Everything on their menu is good (no, seriously). Try something different every time!My favorite dishes are the beef brisket or pulled pork. My favorite sides are the sweet potato fries, the smoked sweet potato, twice-baked potato casserol, or their slaw.Special menu items are their \"Burnt Ends\" which are available at 11am and 5pm every day. These sell out quickly, so get a spot in line at 10:30 or 4:30 if you ever want to try these.", 
      "THE GOOD: the cuisine is really great--entrees, appetizers, and drinks all are 4-5 star foods. I would recommend the the corn bread (it has bits of BBQ pork in it) to start, the chicken sandwich for an entree (its free range and you can tell the difference) and whatever beer is on the \"nitro tap\" (it makes the beer really creamy).THE BAD: customer service is very poor. in order to be seated all of your party must be present. I was hassled because 5 out of 6 of us where there. I understand if 1 person is holding a table down for 6 but 5/6? C'mon. Also, servers have been cold, short, and gruff with my tables. On the whole, the staff comes off very pretentious.HOW TO FIX: right now you are walk in, consider a reservation system; expand your seating area/kitchen to accommodate more customers; ask your staff to be friendly (not many of them smile, honestly!) and understanding (especially in situations like the ones I described); try and give off the vibe that you appreciate our town in which you have been so successful.STAY or GO: I wouldn't pick Black Dog for a meal but I would go if someone else wanted to.", 
      "I absolutely love this place. \u00a0It's the best bbq in Urbana-Champaign by far. \u00a0I've never had something bad at Black Dog. \u00a0The pulled pork, beef brisket, and burgers are all fantastic, and you can't really go wrong with any of the sides. \u00a0Definitely get the cornbread \u00a0- it's amazing and has pulled pork inside of it. \u00a0The only downside is that it gets really crowded and there isn't much room to wait for a table, but it's definitely worth the wait. \u00a0Oh, and if you plan on getting burnt ends, get there when it opens because they'll run out pretty quick.", 
      "Honestly, all I need to say is burnt ends.It's not something I've seen at other bbq places but they really should do it. Seriously, I want to just go in with $50 and be like, \"Load me up on the burnt tips.\"Besides that, I had brisket which was good. I feel like a lot of the smoked brisket I've had before tends to be very tender, but to the point where it's just like shreddy beef sinews. I appreciated that, though this brisket was tender, it had some structural integrity. Twice baked potato casserole was killer and the sweet tea was cloyingly sweet (which is the only way to make sweet tea). I also had slaw, which I didn't love and the sauce was pretty vinegary. But those burnt ends. It was enough to make me look past the little things.I'll be back. You bet I will. And I'll be back for burnt ends (but other good stuff too.)", 
      "Best BBQ in town! Unfortunately, everyone knows it, so the wait can be pretty long (30-40 min) at peak hours. But you can get a drink to pass the time. My favorite is rib tips with Carolina Red sauce, but everything is great here. The beer selection is not huge, but it is always terrific, and they switch it up a lot. Service is friendly, and the food is usually ready quickly (since it's all smoked). I eat here at least once a week, and am not tired of it yet! Good thing, since I always take home leftovers.", 
      "Without a doubt, 5 stars. The beef brisket was fantastic (even better that you could order a lean cut), but the burnt ends is where it's at! Crispy on the outside, still juicy on the inside...I don't know how they do it, but they better not stop any time soon. How about the BBQ sauce you might ask? Fantastic! A little bit spicy, just the way I like it. And don't forget the sides! I don't think you could go wrong with any of them.Now on to the beer. Oh the beer! They rotate selections, and you know they're good when you have 3 of the 8 choices and each one is better than the last. Especially nice that you could take it outside while you're waiting.This is definitely my first stop for whenever I come to town from now on. A-mazing!", 
      "Everything is worth trying here! (even the smoked almonds!) But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance are the burnt ends. Go early, else they will run out.The only problem is the wait... If you don't beat the masses, just order for take out.", 
      "This place is SO worth the wait. The BBQ is so amazing, staff is friendly. \u00a0Small, small eating area and a long line..but so worth it!", 
      "I am so sad I don't live in Urbana anymore! This is the best barbecue I've ever had. Whatever, I know, \"don't overhype,\" but for the price and location it is fantastic.Best dishes: Burnt ends, which are smoked for twelve hours (!) and usually sell out at some point during the lunch shift (comes with the Carolina sauce, which is a bit spicy but genuinely amazing). Blue burger, which has blue cheese, bacon, and a peach barbecue sauce that has ruined every other blue burger I have tried so far. South Carolina burger, which has the same Carolina sauce as the burnt ends and comes with barbecue pork on top (no, it is not good for your cholestorol, but it it is totally worth it). Barbecue salmon (available as a special certain days) that seems strange in concept but basically melts into the barbecue sauce, and is (I assume) the healthiest option you'll come across. Also, the buns are weirdly good? I don't understand, but I appreciate it.Drinks: Go with a craft beer or whiskey list -- the options are many. I love the beer flights, as well.Sides: The cornbread is out of control. It comes with small bits of barbecue pork baked in. Also, it is the size of a piece of pie, so consider splitting. I would get a side of carolina sauces to dip in, it is amazing. Also, the baked beans are flavorful and made me like baked beans. Not as crazy about: The wait time, because it's a small space and the best casual dining in town. I would consider going at opening or in the mid-day lull. But I think they're opening a new location. Also, not a huge fan of the brisket (which is cool, because everything else is life changing).", 
      "Might as well toss my review on the pile of others, I guess. \u00a0I had actually been avoiding Black Dog because of all the hype it's gotten on yelp, sorry to say. \u00a0That was a definite mistake and I wish I had gone here sooner! \u00a0Everything I've tried here has been excellent. \u00a0Even the sweet potato fries, which I usually don't like, were awesome. \u00a0The service was prompt and friendly. \u00a0The prices are pretty darn amazing ($6 for a sandwich and side? \u00a0Awesome). \u00a0And they have fresh squeezed lemonade, free refills. \u00a0My first time here was with my mom and stepdad, and they loved it. \u00a0My stepdad hates pretty much every restaurant we go to, and his most frequently said phrase after dinner is \"4/10.\" \u00a0Black Dog got an \"Eh, I'd come back here,\" which is a ringing endorsement from him.In addition they have a nice selection of beers on draft at all times. \u00a0The first time I went here, my boyfriend got the sampler and it had 4 pale ales, which I was a little disappointed in (though they were pretty good). \u00a0However, they rotate in 6 new beers every week or so (I'm guessing) so it's worth coming back frequently. \u00a0I was there just the other day and got a Left Hand Milk Stout, which happens to be one of my favorites. \u00a0So smooth, so good.", 
      "I'm not much of a meat eater, but Black Dog could change my mind. \u00a0Their barbecue is just succulent. \u00a0I am partial to the burnt ends sandwich with a side of their zippy potato salad. \u00a0Their garden salads are good too and made with local artisan greens. Beer aficiandos will find a wide selection....order the flight of 6 samples to find what you like best. \u00a0Two caveats: \u00a0the wait for a seat can be very long and there's usually congestion at the front door. \u00a0They need a space three times bigger than what they have now. \u00a0Also, don't ever try to order vegetarian stuff. \u00a0There's hardly any on the menu, and what I've tried isn't impressive. \u00a0But who goes to Black Dog to be a vegetarian, anyway!", 
      "HANDS DOWN BEST FOOD IN THE AREA. Im currently living and San Diego but I grew up in Champaign/Urbana Illinois and until this place, the only comparable business was lil porgy's, not that I don't love porgy's, but this is just on another level of good. I know its hard to get their beef brisket BURNT ENDS. But if you can get their early enough on the weekend its worth the wait. I can't say enough good things about this place. Even their own sauces are amazing. You won't leave unsatisfied. I promise. Unless you don't like good BBQ, then you're weird anyways.", 
      "Rad spot. Pulled pork, smoked wings, and cornbread, and sauces were great. Brisket was okay. Solid beer menu. Good service and good prices. Eat here!", 
      "Best bbq in the area, hands down.", 
      "The best BBQ in the area, and a good selection of craft beers on tap. \u00a0The barbecue style is dry-rub which allows you to really taste the meats, rather than everything being covered in sauce.Everything is good, but the pulled pork, ribs, and chicken wings are my favorites. \u00a0Also, try the corn bread. The bits of meat and peppers in the bread surprised me, but now it's the only cornbread I eat!", 
      "This has become one of my new favorite restaurants in Urbana. The food is very tasty and the service is friendly. The prices are very reasonable. I like the beef brisket and the pit beans.My only complaints are that it gets very loud in there, and has bad acoustics. Also, I've noticed the food can be a bit inconsistent as I have the same meal almost every time. But other than that, I really like it.", 
      "My wife and I have now been to Black Dog Smoke & Ale House twice and have been absolutely blown away by the food and atmosphere. \u00a0The first trip I had the full slab of ribs while my wife tried the brisket. \u00a0Both were absolutely delicious. \u00a0We even tried the full flight of sauce's and enjoyed them all. \u00a0My wife adores the sweet potato fries.On our second trip, I had to try the pork belly sandwich...in fact, we both did. \u00a0UNREAL. \u00a0It is unbelievably tender, and the addition of their red cabbage slaw on the bun is a real nice addition. \u00a0As for the beer, try the Sawtooth Ale. \u00a0A very nice compliment to their BBQ. \u00a0I now have a favorite new restaurant in Urbana. \u00a0My only complaint, like others before me, is the size of the restaurant. \u00a0I don't know that the owners knew their little eatery would be as overwhelmingly successful as it has become, because it can be quite difficult to get a seat. \u00a0Their aren't many booths and/or tables in addition to the bar seating. \u00a0We arrived at 4pm on a Saturday afternoon thinking it would be dead and still had to wait. \u00a0Might be time to either add or move to a new location. \u00a0In closing, I cannot recommend Black Dog enough. \u00a0Just delicious, home cooked BBQ in the cornfields. \u00a0Can't wait to try the \"Burnt Ends\" that everyone is raving about.", 
      "I have been to Black Dog 3 times in the last week if that says anything. I love their food, pretty much all of it. I get their ribs a lot but their burgers and sandwiches are hard to pass up. Don't forget to add on their sweet potato fries and their cornbread (the best cornbread I have ever had). Their other sides are very good but the sweet potato fries are so amazing its hard to pass them up. The chicken wings are possibly the best in town. All of the sauces are excellent, I highly recommend getting the sample sauce tray.Downside to this place is the wait but if you go early or late you generally only have to wait 15-20 minutes. I also suggest no more people than 4 as it is a very small place. The bar is a great place to sit so don't count it out.The beer selection is excellent and I highly recommend the flight if you have some time (and a DD). The cocktails are so good and strong, just the way they should be! My biggest wish is that they will open a second location in Downtown Champaign.", 
      "Like all the reviews say, this is a popular place. \u00a0Plan to wait on the curb (literally) for your table with the rest of the hungry patrons. \u00a0Ordered the platters (3 meat choices) and we mixed up the sides. \u00a0Meat was excellent and the highlight was the burnt ends. \u00a0Wow. \u00a0Don't miss them. \u00a0Sweet potato fries were good, but I've had better, probably because these ones had cooled down.This is a don't miss food destination that should satisfy your BBQ craving.", 
      "Seated in the heart of downtown Urbana, this restaurant gives the BBQ lover and anyone who loves a laid back, eclectic environment essentially nirvana. The help is great, and while you may wait a bit because it's generally busy (We went at 3:00 on Saturday and had a 10 minute wait), it's well worth it. Their menu is extensive and their selection of spirits was something that was pleasantly surprising. We all had different things and everyone was happy with their choices, and if you are a BBQ enthusiast, the house BBQ is definitely different, with a tangy vinegary taste with a nice smoky kick to it. If you haven't been there and have the opportunity, run, don't walk!!!", 
      "The best restaurant in the Champaign/Urbana area regardless of type of food, no question. I am originally from L.A and an almuni of the U of I, and in my 4 years in the area, this place consistently serves up the best meals. Whenever I go back down to school, I always make sure I go to Black Dog.Logistics: They won't seat you until your full party is there, and make sure you arrive on the earlier side of whatever meal you plan on going to (5,5:30pm is a good bet for dinner, 11am or so for lunch). The waiting area inside is very small, but there is a nice size bar and tvs.Food: Everything i've ever had from here is great. A go-to is always the combos, and obviously the BURNT ENDS have to be part of whatever creation you make. The ribs, pulled pork, brisket, rib tips, and all of the sandwiches and specials i've tried are delicious. There are some excellent sauces- Hot Georgia Peach and Carlina Red are my 2 favorites. As for sides, the thing to order is baked potato casserole- that alone might be the single best dish on my plate. They have specials all of the time and new dishes that are creative and unique.Beer: Always some local, midwest brews on tap, and they change it up very frequently. The beers they offer are seasonal, the the fall/winter beers are particularly tasty. A great place to get a great meal, some good beers, and watch some games.Service: The service is as good as the food, which is remarkable considering how busy the place gets. There always seems to be 2 waiters around which doesn't seem like much and really isn't- and they do run around, but the service is always fast, pleasant, and attentive. You never feel rushed, the waiters never seem to be too stressed, and they really do a great job.", 
      "This is just another well deserved, 5-star review for the Black Dog. \u00a0The BBQs are amazing, and the prices are just as good. \u00a0The beer selection is top-notch, and the service is fast and friendly. \u00a0My personal favorite: \u00a0The burnt-ends sandwich w/ the Carolina red sauce and a smoked sweet potato for the side. \u00a0I think I might go there tonight, actually.", 
      "Was driving back to WI from IN and based on the reviews from Yelp decided to eat lunch here. \u00a0It did not disappoint!! \u00a0When we opened the door to go in there was a LINE of people to be seated. \u00a0We thought the wait would be really long, but they are quick there! \u00a0There was two of us and one had the pulled pork and one had the brisket. \u00a0Both had GREAT flavor - Very tender and delicious! \u00a0We both had the Carolina Red sauce and loved it. \u00a0One had sweet potato fries and one had regular fries - again, both were great! \u00a0The staff was great - very friendly and quick service. \u00a0Would definitely go back if driving through that way!", 
      "Simply put, Black Dog has excellent barbecue. I have yet to try something from the menu that I don't like, and I've actually been pleasantly surprised each time I've tried something new. I usually go for the pulled chicken sandwich (with locally raised, free-range chicken) with Georgia Peach BBQ sauce, and a side of sweet potato fries or pit beans. The chicken has always been incredibly moist, and the peach BBQ is a perfect compliment. Absolutely delicious. I've also tried the brisket, pork tacos, and burnt ends, which were amazing. The sides have also all been delicious, from the corn bread to the spicy potato salad.In addition to the food, the selection of beer on tap is typically pretty varied and affordable. I almost always get a beer with my meal...well, when I'm not feeling too cheap, that is. ;)The only thing that hasn't been consistently good is the service. Don't get me wrong, it's never been bad, per se. They've always been very friendly, but the waitstaff gets easily overwhelmed. So, if it's busy (which it will be around lunch time and early evening), just be patient and don't be afraid to get someone's attention if you feel you're not being noticed.If you love barbeque and supporting awesome local businesses, you should definitely give Black Dog a go."

      "The fact that I cannot even seem to get into the place at lunch makes me really want to give them less than 5 stars. \u00a0At least 75% of the time, I have to go somewhere else because I can't spend my limited allotment of lunch break just standing around drooling.But the place is undeniable. \u00a0Their burnt ends are a revelation. \u00a0I could eat the Carolina Red sauce with a spoon. \u00a0In a moment of semi-health consciousness, I ordered the applesauce, and even that knocked my socks off... literally. \u00a0I spent 35 minutes trying to fish them out from under my table.I am so tempted to give the place 1 star and tell the rest of you yokels to go eat somewhere else. \u00a0For goodness sake, let me have a lunch here every once in a blue moon. \u00a0But I cannot do that for it would be a fib.Instead, I'll just be THAT guy standing over by the door... looking over your shoulder... and trying to use my powers of telepathy to get you to eat and leave sooner so I can sit down.", 
      "This place is without a doubt, the BEST BBQ IN ILLINOIS. My boyfriend went to U of I and we somehow stumbled upon this hidden gem. Well, I suppose it's not so hidden since there is usually a long wait. But don't be discouraged! The wait is well worth it, I promise. Try to make your way through the door, find the guy in charge, and put your name on the list. There's not much space in this place. I guess that would be my one complaint. It can get pretty crunched, especially if you're waiting. However, what is better to tide you over than a delicious beer? Now, let's talk about this beer.They have new selections on tap all the time. Please, do your beer pallet a favor and don't order the usual domestics and imports (Miller, Bud, Heiniken, Corona, etc). Those are just fine for any regular restaurant. Why miss the glorious opportunity to try something mind-blowingly good? Seriously, these beers are amazing. They come from different breweries across the country. Places/companies you've never heard of. Combinations of flavors you would never think to try. I once had an oyster beer here. Sounds disgusting but it was so good. Trust me on that. I'm very picky and I liked it. You can also get a flight of 7 beers on a dogbone shaped tray (how fitting!). This flight has all the beers that are on tap in 4 oz glasses. You can share them with a friend and then order the one you like best!Now, on to the food. So SO good. There are a few different sauce choices you can get. Not being one for spicy, I get the Georgia Peach. It is soo good on anything you get. There is no bad item on this menu. The pulled pork is amazing as are the hamburgers. Hard to believe a hamburger could be so good, but it is. The brisket is also amazing. They cook it for 12 hours. How could it not be? Try to get here relatively early though, because some items like the brisket run out later in the evening. While it's a bummer, think of it as a good thing. This way, you know they're not just heating it in the microwave. They cook it, and once it's gone, it's gone. Oh and the fries are amazing, whether you get the regular or sweet potato.I know this was a long review, but I really can't say enough about this place. I'm obsessed. It's a bummer that my bf graduated so we can't go all the time since we live near Chicago. However, I will make any excuse to go down. Going there this weekend for Halloween. Can't wait to visit my favorite BBQ place in all the land!", 
      "I'm pissed I only discovered this place in my last 2 years on campus. I think it's impossible to order anything and not like it, even a little.I was back on campus last weekend and tried the Chicken Wings - a seriously underestimated menu item. See, just when I think I've tried it all, I discover something else that's awesome.The chef likes to get creative with the daily specials too- so that's fun.Wow, I've already done all this raving and I haven't even had to start talking about their alcohol selection. In my opinion, it's a crime not to order a specialty beer off their vast tap list to wash down their killer BBQ. Students at U of I - get here as often as possible before graduation!", 
      "Love, love, love Black Dog, and so happy that they're opening another location in downtown Champaign. There are only two downsides to the place: everything tends to be a bit smoky (so if you don't like that, be aware) and there's always a line out the door. The food is great. The pulled pork is a personal favorite, and while I never switch away from the Carolina Red (reminds me of barbecue at home) my friends love the Georgia Peach sauce. The brisket is also good- nice and tender- and the rib tips are fantastic. I don't like cornbread, but theirs is good (plus they bake meat into the bread- always a plus). They've recently slimmed down their beer menu a bit, but it's still very diverse, as is their whiskey menu. There are a lot of bourbons here that you can't order elsewhere in town (including Evan Williams 1783, a personal favorite). The place is too damn small and I wish they'd have burnt ends a bit more often (they're very good). But I can't really complain.", 
      "Great BBQ. Amazing smoked flavor on chicken wings appetizer, the brisket and Ribs combo plate I ordered .. A must. Very good pricing too. Well worth the wait. The staff is great. Be ready to go through a roll of paper towels it it finger licking good.", 
      "I'm a mostly-veggie eater, and I love this place. Their portabello sandwich is among the best I've ever had -- apparently smoking is the secret to cooking a big mushroom all the way through evenly and flavorfully. The catfish is also delicious. Love getting a flight of sauces and working my way through them between dinner and the excellent sides. I highly recommend the sweet potato fries and, if it's summer, the smoked sweet corn. Yum! As most everyone else has said, the meats are also delicious -- according to my husband and the tons of people we've brought here for lunch or dinner.Their tap list is relatively small -- they usually have somewhere around 7 beers at a time -- but there's always lovely choices. Recently, there's been some absolutely delicious dark pumpkin / apple fall beers! Bar and food service sometimes seems rushed, but surprisingly good for how busy they get.This place is insanely busy at pretty much all hours (30-min wait at 8.30pm on a Wednesday?), but it has still become our default for out-of-town guests. That says a whole heck of a lot.", 
      "I just revisited, and I had a great experience! I ordered the burnt ends sandwich and cornbread. The sandwich was great and the sauce variety is awesome. My friends and I all got different sauces and tried one another's. Carolina Red, the house sauce, and Chipotle were my favorites. I would also highly recommend the cornbread - it has pulled pork in it!", 
      "This place is awesome. Always a wait but well worth it. \u00a0Love that the beer selection is always rotating. I always order something different and have been pleased and STUFFED each time. A MUST go when visiting the champaign/urbana area.", 
      "Finally was able to get in to this place; there's always a line out the door, which speaks to the quality.Made it there around 8:30 on a Saturday night, and immediately got a seat at the bar. Smoked catfish sandwich was probably the best sandwich I ever had. Twice-baked potatoes were an excellent side.But the best thing was the waiter; when I told him what beer I wanted, he said, \"Well, it's OK, but how often will you come here?\" He pointed me instead to a Founder's seasonal release which was phenomenal. The only problem now is: what do I do with all the beer I already have at home?Came back the following (Super Bowl) night, and the burnt ends were not sold out - and it was just as good as the night before.I will definitely be back!", 
      "Surprisingly good BBQ in a small town! \u00a0The sauces can be REALLY spicy, and I can handle my fair share of spiciness! \u00a0The habanero and other sauce are different here... I've had spicy food/sauces that burn all the way through and linger for a long time, but Black Dog has sauces that burns going down, then it disappears (to give you hope), and reappears within 30 seconds to a minute... and then it burns and lingers for a long time. \u00a0MADNESS! \u00a0IF you're in Urbana-Champaign, try this spot!", 
      "I like to treat myself to a wonderful dinner on my birthday. \u00a0I've spent four birthdays at blackdog. Enough said.", 
      "I'm not sure what else there is to say about Black Dog that hasn't already been said.It's the best barbecue in Central Illinois. It has an excellent whiskey selection and always carries a few good draft beers (that are usually different from the beers on tap at other bars in town).The place is small and at peak hours the wait approaches absurdity.Eat the burnt ends. Eat the corn bread.And I'm not sure I'm supposed to tell you this, but if you are a spicy food lover, they have an off-menu Ghost Pepper sauce that will wreck you. And I mean what I say. Wrecked. They should make you sign a waiver to even serve you the stuff.Just go. But if you're smart, get hungry between 2-5pm. Or be there before they open.", 
      "I will concede that as someone who grew up in Champaign, and has since moved away, I tend to be a bit nostalgic about the town and may romanticize it a bit. I had never been to Black Dog when I lived in town, but on a recent visit some good friends told me it was THE place to go. We arrived around lunch time and we expected to wait for a table. The restaurant sits MAYBE 30 people, and this is a good thing. We only had to wait about 15 minutes, which given the number of people and the small seating area, I thought was pertty good.Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made great suggestions. I ended up ordering brisket and pulled pork. Both were delicious. The smoke ring on the brisket was a beautiful color and all the flavor was there. The house BBQ sauce which came with the meal was EXCELLENT and though I have heard that they have several other options, I'm not sure there would ever be any need.Another bonus was that Black Dog had a small, but great, beer selection. They had 7 beers on draft, all of which were really good. They offered a sampler of 4 oz. pours, which was a great thing to enjoy with my meal. \u00a0It was a LITTLE nerdy that the beers were served in a \"dog bone\" shaped serving platter, but I suppose it was fun.Overall, I had a great experience at Black Dog and I would love to return on my next visit.", 
      "Even though myself and my girlfriend showed up around 5, there was already a line waiting to be seated. \u00a0This establishment is small, and if you are going around dinner time, be prepared to wait. \u00a0However, we found it to be well worth waiting for once we were seated (which was actually at a weird sort-of-bar at the back of the restaurant). \u00a0I am not a barbecue aficionado, but this was definitely the best place I have ever been to. \u00a0I got a pulled pork sandwich, since I had read so much about it, and was definitely not disappointed (I was pleasantly surprised at the fact it was served with slaw on top). \u00a0My girlfriend got a brisket sandwich, which was very good, though I preferred my sandwich. \u00a0In addition, we got sweet potato fries, which were delicious.They had a fairly extensive drink menu for a restaurant, though not quite as large as a few of the other establishments in the Champaign/Urbana area. \u00a0Their draft beer selection was good, and they had a good selection of bottled beer. \u00a0In addition to this, the service was both prompt and pleasant, and when I ordered a bottle of Lone Star after having Dogfish Head, the waitress (thankfully) talked me out of downgrading like that (I was... unfamiliar... with Lone Star, I guess it is like Budweiser).Overall, I was very satisfied with this restaurant, and I plan on going again soon (though I have to pick a time when I'm not terribly hungry, due to the wait).", 
      "I came in sometime around 3:30 looking to eat what became my only real meal of the day. (Raise your hand if you've been there before on a Sunday). My friend, a recent transplant to the area, suggested a \"pretty sweet BBQ place\" instead of the much closer and cheaper McDonald's near his apartment. \"Oh, and they also have their own beer.\" Sold. So, walking in, the seating space is really rather small for a pub/restaurant - and way too hungry to wait for a table - so we just sat at the bar. I Yelped this place before leaving and was told to try the Burnt Ends but to get there early to do so. Well, they were out. And they were also out of catfish. Luck of the draw of coming in late on an NFL playoff game day, I suppose. I ended up getting the rib tips with regular French fries and the Southwestern potato salad, with the Left Hand Milk Stout to drink. I mean, if I'm gonna carbo-load, why not do it in style?Anyway, our first server ended up also giving me a small sample of a blueberry ale just in case I'd be coming back or ordering more beer with my dinner. I suppose if I liked blueberries, I'd be all over this, but I'm not such a fan... however, I certainly appreciate the offer. I also ended up having the one beer of theirs they had on tap the night before at a bar, so I didn't want to double dip and ended up going with a Hennepin saison instead.The food finally came, after many delays informing my friend that supply was limited on catfish and eventually running out of it. The Carolina Red BBQ sauce is very tasty but has a hidden kick to it. With the rib tips, it was perfect. That said - though the fries were great (but maybe a bit skimpy on the serving size) and the Southwestern potato salad was good (but I was almost hoping for it to be a bit closer to room temperature), the rib tips themselves were tender and flavorful, but I thought there was a bit too much fat on them, whether marbled in or around the little bits of bone. The parts closer to the edges were fine, but towards the center were tricky. I don't want to imply that this is standard practice, but due to having to cancel both items my friend ordered, he was able to substitute something else on the menu and get comped for it on the bill. Much appreciated. However, our original server kind of disappeared for a while so we ended up being served by a guy that sort of looks like Paul McCartney around 1968, and he did a great job.", 
      "I am just yelping to add that their baked sweet potatoes are great. They are baked in the wood smoke oven and when you reheat them the next day, you want to go back to the Black Dog as soon as you can.The place is as good as its high rating, and is a remarkable value for the price.", 
      "The best BBQ I've ever had, the best smoked meat I've ever had, the best sauces I've ever had. This place has it all! It's inexpensive, everything is delicious and has a monthly rotation of great beer (at a good price).Bit of advice: get there early, it's always packed.", 
      "This place is really good and probably the best in Urbana... \u00a0The sweet potato fries are my favorite and deserve 6 STARS!! \u00a0:) \u00a0Their ranch dressing is amazing.. \u00a0To me the BBQ is a bit spicy.. Even the mildest \u00a0one. But overall I feel this place is worth the wait, although when its REALLY crowded we just get the order to go, and its quicker..", 
      "Listen, listen, listen, listen. I love eating. One of the reasons I love our community is the number of great restaurants and environments in which I can eat. And Black Dog is my #1 favorite of all those food-serving places. It's cozy, with friendly staff who give the place a neighborhood-bar feel. Come with a friend and you can get seated at the bar, even at peak time, without having to wait too long. Come with more than one friend and you'll have to wait, but DEAL WITH IT DAWG. Patience is a virtue, and pulled pork BBQ with Hot Georgia Peach will be in you soon.", 
      "Best bbq i ever had! I always take my friends from out of town here when getting bbq!", 
      "Best in the area!", 
      "This place is perfect except for the long lines and running out of the smoked meats later in the evening. I would recommend going during lunchtime or right at 5pm if you don't want to wait.The bbq is amazing, I usually have the pulled pork but their beef is great as well. Sweet potato fries are excellent, and their pit beans are really delicious too. Their sauce actually isn't all that great, too much vinegar and not enough spice, but the taste of the meat is so perfect that it doesn't matter. I'd recommend having the sauce on the side.Beer selection is good and they always have a few great choices on tap. Best bbq place (if not the best restaurant period) in Champaign-Urbana, hands down.", 
      "Smaller hole in wall kind of place w modern Irish Style settings but limited seating durning lunch time. Yet the wait is definitely worth it! The BBQ aroma is welcoming when the front door is opened. Many different types of sandwiches and sauces. Sweet potato fries!!!! And of course many beers!Awesome college hot spot!!!!", 
      "They have some great BBQ here. \u00a0I've done the brisket, burnt ends and pulled pork. \u00a0All of them are top notch.Grab some cornbread. \u00a0You won't regret it.The beer flights are awesome as well. \u00a0Do yourself a favor and try some new beers.You'll probably have to wait to get a seat. \u00a0It's worth it.I've never really felt that rushed. \u00a0It is a small place though and I can see how people might feel rushed.", 
      "This place will forever have a specisl time in my heart now. I've been in Urbana-Champaign for one semester and I have been here a total of five times. The service is generally fast and there is at least one waiter that id absolutely hilarious. It is not their fault that there is almost always a wait. If you want a table fast, I recommend showing up after the lunch-rush is over but before the dinner-crowd starts to arrive. The food is spectacular and you will enjoy every bite. I strongly recommend trying the cornbread appetizer. It is heavenly.", 
      "Yummy food and drink! I am not in this part of town often so I can't go a lot, but I enjoy it whenever I do. Has very flavorful BBQ.... hard to compare to anything else!Also, they often have pictures of black rescue dogs that need homes. Love that! Great way to show your support for adoption! \u00a0They get brownie points in my book for that!", 
      "Some of the BEST BBQ I have ever had! Great little place to grab some lunch but sometimes you'll have to wait in line but the wait is TOTALLY worth it! Got the pulled pork sandwich with the BBQ beans and it was SOOOO GOOD! Go -you will NOT regret it!", 
      "One of the best BBQ out there. \u00a0Like everyone else says, be prepared to wait. \u00a0It is definitely worth the wait, and the prices are extremely acceptable for the great tasting food.", 
      "As we entered we were enthusiastically greeted by one of the servers. Hopefully, as you'd expect, all of the staff members are as nice as she is, come to find out the bartender we had wasn't as peachy. Not that she was mean, just general going through the motions and not just for us but for all guests seated at the bar. The food was decently good, just not as finger-lickin amazing as everyone I have spoken with prior to this visit made me feel it was going to be. I did really enjoy their sweet potato fries (nice and crisp and thick). The chicken sandwich I had was good, once the barbecue sauce was able to make its way down to the pulled chicken on the bottom of the bun. Otherwise, it was a bit dry. My boyfriend had the Carolina sandwich and he enjoyed that along with the potato salad as his side.A good selection of alcoholic beverages with not the largest selection of beers. The \"Ale House\" part of the name gave us the impression that maybe there were several selections on tap but, as I recall, there weren't a ton nor could we see the tap handles (outside of 1) to get a visual (sometimes that's nice to see). Of course there was a beer list, though. Overall, not a terrible experience but just a basic one. Nothing crazy.", 
      "I'm a big fan of BBQ and was excited to try this place. I got pulled pork, burnt ends, and ribs. The pork was a little more dry than I like, the burnt ends are amazing! (Will keep me coming back) the ribs were a total let down, too dry and chewy. \u00a0The sauces are great but they default to one so be sure to tell them what you want.", 
      "This is the best place to eat in the urbana-champaign area! \u00a0Its cramped and the wait is long but its worth it!", 
      "Great freaking BBQ!!! it's not the sauce, it's the smoked meat! Best Brisket I've had for sure! Tender like no other!! The wait may be long, but worth it. Drove by last night and didn't want to wait cuz of the big crowds waiting outside...yup regretting it now! Could have tried some of their other faire...now wishing I had a bigger belly to stuff with brew and BBQ.", 
      "Edit: Flaws ironed out and the Black Dog is Heaven! Full 5-star experience every time!Original review: Very good! In brief, my wife and I have found the service to be friendly and efficient, the food to be intensely flavorful, and the cost quite reasonable. Add to this good beer, and you have a restaurant that it is fast becoming our default meal when we don't have a specific craving and just want a nice night out.We have eaten widely from the menu, and especially recommend the wings, the pulled pork, and the cornbread. They often have specials, which so far have also been great.There are still a few small kinks, such as only having four napkin dispensers along the entire bar that seats 15 or so people (I had to ask for napkins, which one should never need to do at a barbecue joint! And then they needed to be taken away for someone else, and I had to ask for them again...). Hopefully the owners read reviews and/or use their common sense to iron out what few flaws currently exist.", 
      "The largest problem that I have with Yelp reviews of restaurants is that it doesn't have separate categories for reviews of service, decor, atmosphere and the food itself (which is why one usually reads reviews for, ironically). In order to facilitate easy understanding of my opinions, please note that the Rating is in relation to the quality of the food itself while the other categories will be rated below. Service: 3.5 - depending on the crowd one can either get their food fairly quickly or 40 minutes later; I am a huge fan of the BBQ here but a couple of weeks ago, with a large crowd, I had to wait at least 40 mins for my Catifsh sandwich. Decor: 3 - nothing to write home about but they do have 2 large flatscreens always showing sports so its nice to sit at the bar with a good beer and food in order to enhance one's viewing experience. Food: 5 - It is hands down, the best BBQ in the area. The quality per price ratio is also top notch since the larger helpings will usually tide people over for leftovers as well as fill those who are ravenous. The beer here is really good and reflective of the overall abundance of good microbrews and international beers available in the Champaign-Urbana area. My favorites here are the burnt ends, beef brisket, ribs, catfish, pit beans and the mac cheese special side on Thursdays.", 
      "3.5 stars. Very good, not spectacular. The ribs were smoky but still kind of tough and the house sauce wasn't a great complement. I heard good things about the burnt ends but they were sold out. The brisket was outstanding; I'd come back again and again for it. Worth the visit alone.Their potato souffle thing was overcooked and average. Beans were reheated in the microwave and the foam container melted, kind of gross looking but the beans were decent. Service isn't too friendly, but I never judge places based upon if they smile or not as long as the food comes out hot, and in this case it was so hot the container side melted.", 
      "I like Black Dog. It's one of the better places in CU. I enjoy the Cuban sandwich and the pulled pork is good, too. Great beer selection. I usually get the sweet potato fries.The customer service is not good, though. I've had indifferent and flat out rude service, in fact. The wait is often long, too.", 
      "Love this place! Everything I've had here has been awesome. The cornbread, BBQ, I've even had the Cuban which was good. The service has always been passable. This is after all a bar, and I'd rather have my servers be brief and move people and food than have to wait in a line for 45 min because they took their time and were super chatty (as opposed to the 45 min wait because the food is great).", 
      "This is my favorite restaurant in Champaign-Urbana. It's not perfect, but if I had let myself, I probably could've eaten there every week. The downside is that it is small. Small to the point where I would do ridiculous things and tell my group of friends \"everyone get there at 10:45am\". Oh, and your entire party has to be there if you want to be seated. But the bbq. Fantastic. Get the burnt ends if they aren't out for the day (they run out on those early). They also tend to have an interesting beer selection. Sides are good, too. My bbq of choice was the hot Georgia Peach. Personal favorite combination was the burnt ends sandwich with hot Georgia Peach sauce and sweet potato fries on the side. The cornbread is good, too (it does have meat in it though).", 
      "Everything here is great. \u00a0Rivals some of the best BBQ I've had in the GA and NC (the basis for many of their sauces). I'll also add that they know how to do takeout well. BBQ is a hard food to get right for takeout, but both times I've had it it's tasted almost as good as when I've eaten there.That may help solve some of the long wait problems that people have correctly pointed out.", 
      "They recommended the burnt ends sandwich and I was not disappointed. \u00a0Great flavors at a reasonable price."

      "The Black Dog has amazing Burnt Ends, a must try! But get there early, they sell out fast and the wait to be seated can be long. Be sure to sign your name on the butcher paper to be seated. The BBQ is good and the portions are big! The twice baked potatoes were delicious.", 
      "The food and beer are really good. \u00a0As stated in many other reviews, this place is really small. Prices are pretty reasonable. \u00a0The smoked catfish and sweet potato fries were just smokey and soft. \u00a0The beer sampler is worth a try. There is a good selection of stouts if you like them. \u00a0This place is a must visit if you are in the Champaign-Urbana area.", 
      "Best food in CU.Excellent cornbread with peppers and pulled pork baked into it. \u00a0Pulled pork & briskets are both good, the burnt tips are the best item but they run out quickly at lunch and dinner. \u00a0A few excellent sauces. My fave: hot georgia peach, but the carolina vinegar & mustard are good. \u00a0The sides are good: \u00a0excellent slaw, good baked beans, & decent potato salad. Great beer selection, better brown liquor selection. As a bonus, they occasionally have neat add ons like smoked ice (turns your bourbon into scotch). The downside: the restaurant selection in CU is so impoverished that Black Dog is always crowded, and I mean crowded as heck (this includes a Thurs at 2pm in late May after the undergrads left). My tip: get takeout. \u00a0It's inexpensive (especially because you're saving the cost of alcohol). Just don't get the fries as a side.", 
      "The best BBQ in the city, hands down! Be prepared to wait a little while to be seated (it's that GOOD) but worth the wait! The servers were very helpful and knowledgable & I enjoyed the atmosphered. The pulled pork was DELICIOUS, upset I was not able to try the burnt ends due to them being sold out - as they were highly recommended. Overall, it was a great date with my fianc\u00e9 and we are HIGHLY anticipating our return!", 
      "Black Dog has THE best BBQ in the Champaign/Urbana area hands down. \u00a0Now all they need is a larger space to serve it in, i love the bar setting, but not one that has outgrown its space because of how good their product is. \u00a0Waits are common of up to 30 mins anytime you go.As for the food, lets start with the Wings appetizer, delicious smoked wings and the kick of the Carolina BBQ sauce puts them over the top. \u00a0My wife can't stop talking about how good the burnt ends are, and she must not be the only one because the sell out frequently. \u00a0 Loved the ribs, just wish they had some baby backs to choose from.All in all you will not beat this place for BBQ anywhere within a hundred miles!", 
      "This is by far the best bbq in East-Central Illinois and it has one of the best beer selections around to go with it.Nearly everything is made from scratch and has that creative twist you only get when people really care about what they are doing.", 
      "\"Best Food In Champaign-Urbana!\"Although there is always generally a wait, and if you want their delicious Burnt Ends you have to come early in the evening, Black Dog is well worth it. Nearly everything you order at Black Dog is excellent. The southern-style smoky greatness of their BBQ and sides is mouth watering. Black Dog offers a great list of whiskeys and also serves many good micro-brews. Burnt Ends and Spare Ribs are extremely good, as is their side order of Smoky Pit Beans. Occasionally I'll order a Carolina Burger, which is a burger with pull pork on top, when I want to mix things up. Many people rave about their corn bread, as it is also delicious. Daily specials help keep the mix of food fresh, however I could never grow tired of Black Dog. Recently the restaurant started serving special Late Night items after 10:30pm that features special cocktails and menu items (like Gourmet Hot Dogs/Sausages) that you cannot order during regular hours, which are great as well. Try Black Dog, you won't regret it, but you might just feel frustrated thinking about the soonest time you can come back for more. Note: When choosing a sauce, Hot Georgia Peach is the way to go. (But hell, you can order a Flight of Sauces and try them all for yourself. Enjoy!)", 
      "Food is very good. my favorite is the burnt end sandwich. Sweet potato fries are okay but it's a bit dry, should probably dip it in honey or something. However my one biggest complaint is the wait. every time i've came here it's been an hour wait. The burnt ends are usually gone long before dinner. In fact, i got laughed at once when I came in at 9pm asking for burnt ends. It's good that it's opened till 11pm which is an hour more than most restaurants on campus. However, considering the amount you pay, I would rather go to lil porgy's.. better bang for my buck and their rib tips are ah mazing for less than $6.", 
      "Awesome food and beer selection. Usually a wait and often run out of certain things. Wish i could eat here every day! The sauces are all kind of the same to me.", 
      "We had an awesome lunch at Black Dog! Jeff had the burnt ends and brisket. I had a cheeseburger. Twice baked potato casserole was amazing. Burnt ends were some of the best meat he's ever had. You have to get there early or you might have quite the wait! Food is definitely worth the wait!", 
      "Good food. \u00a0Best in the area for BBQ. \u00a0Really long wait and not the best service. \u00a0I wouldn't mind but when its cold there is no space for those waiting. Got yelled at for trying to get a drink from the bar while waiting for a table.", 
      "What a fantastic bbq stop, \u00a0the burnt ends were insane, \u00a0I loved them, \u00a0you cant go wrong \u00a0here with the protien choices. Solid sides, \u00a0our server was very unique and entertaining and on point with recommendations.", 
      "Everything I have had here is phenomenal: Beef ends, pulled pork, brisket, and obviously the sweet potato fries. \u00a0The service is disappointing, though. \u00a0There is always a crowd waiting to be seated, and so the servers are very rushed. \u00a0The problem is that they let you know this. \u00a0I was there on a Saturday night, and our server handed us out menus and immediately demanded to know what our drinks orders were. \u00a0The look of annoyance on his face when I asked for something they don't have was obvious. \u00a0Sorry you had to stand at our table for an extra 10 seconds. \u00a0Then when we were leaving, I quickly placed my purse on the table while I put my coat on. \u00a0The lady cleaning up immediately asked \"Whose purse is this?\" \u00a0So while the food is amazing and I will be back, don't expect to be treated as anything more than a number to be rushed in and out as fast as possible.", 
      "Can I give this more than 5 stars? The food was amazing. Be prepared to wait. It's well worth it though. We came at 1:45 and there was still a line out the door. They were out of some food, but to me that was a good sign. The corn bread was awesome- who would think to put chillies, and pulled pork IN a corn bread? Genius.The pulled pork was big and delicious and SMOKEY. mmm. Potato salad had a nice flavor/kick to it. Anyways, I'm sure I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said 245 times already though. Do yourself a favor and get in line at the Black Dog already.", 
      "I don't live in Urbana anymore and this is definitely one of the places I miss the most! I have never once been disappointed by the food or service at this place.Do yourself a favor and start off with the Texas Caviar as an appetizer, you can thank me later.I normally always got the smoked salmon sandwich. I've never been a huge fan of coleslaw, but the way theirs is prepared, and ON the actual sandwich, is just delicious. The sweet potato fries are too good as is any other side I've ever ventured to try.Also the, I think it's called the Carolina burger, a fat delicious burger with pulled pork on top is really good too!You may very well have to wait, but it is so so so worth it.", 
      "Delicious food and great beer selection. I could live on the corn bread and I'm usually not a big fan of cornbread.Good lunch prices. Be prepared to wait for a table. Great atmosphere with friendly staff.", 
      "Please, please, please, put one of these restaurants in Bloomington-Normal.Although this restaurant \u00a0is small, \u00a0the pulled pork sandwich that I ordered was wonderful. \u00a0 \u00a0 The mixture of pork, coleslaw, and Georgia Peach bbq sauce that they put on the sandwich really hit the spot.The sweet potato fries were solid too.My only complaint about the food was with the \"hot\" version of the Georgia Peach bbq sauce that we also tried. \u00a0Avoid it - the restaurant needs to tweak that sauce a bit. \u00a0 It's really hot.", 
      "Delicious, delicious barbecue. I didn't even know that I liked barbecue until I ate at Black Dog for the first time. I recommend any of the sandwiches, and the spicy southwest potato salad is SPICY and wonderful. The corn bread is dense and buttery with pieces of pulled pork inside; very filling and rich and tasty.You will almost always have to wait for a table at this restaurant because the space is so small. I've heard that ordering take-out works really well to cut down the waiting time before you get to eat, but I haven't tried it yet. The waitstaff are always friendly, though sometimes a little frazzled from the huge numbers of customers coming through for the amazing food.",

      "My wife's birthday was over the weekend, and it seemed like having a good lunch was in the cards. Being a big barbeque fan, she selected the Black Dog Smoke & Ale House. We had heard so many good things about it that we finally decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed.We were aware that the biggest drawback would be the wait for a table, so we left home early to get there right before it opened. Several other people had the same idea. We were given a nice greeting upon entering and were seated immediately. We were told that we might have a bit of a wait for service since we were seated before the place opened, but our waitress came by right away. We decided to start the meal with the appetizer we were most curious about: the burnt ends. Although a tad pricy, the meat lived up to everything we had read -- flavorful, wonderfully chewy around the edges, with melt-in-your mouth smoky goodness.For our lunch, we both had pulled pork sandwiches, sweet potato fries, and an additional side of twice baked potato casserole. The sandwiches were excellent -- wonderfull smokey meat, slaw, and excellent Carolina Red barbeque sauce. The sweet potato french fries actually tasted like sweet potatoes, but I am not sure why others have raved about them. They were just okay, as was the casserole. But ... we came to this place looking for excellent barbecue, and it delivered!We were happy we decided to eat right when the place opened because a line formed as we were eating our lunch. We decided to make a quick exit so that someone else could get our table. We were in and out in about 35 minutes.Would we come here again? Definitely! Next time I would like to try the Georgia Peach barbeque sauce and sample the chicken and catfish. I decided to only go with four stars because the sides were only average in our estimation. Next time we will try some others.", 
      "My searching is over! \u00a0Hands down best BBQ in the whole C-U area! \u00a0Prices are EXTREMELY low and food is exceptional! \u00a0My friends and I visit this place embarrassingly often.Only cons: Very small and most people leave after seeing the line of people waiting to be seated. \u00a0I don't think there is ever not a line. \u00a0HOWEVER, it is very worth it, they do their best to sit you in a timely fashion and once you start eating you will forget that you waited. \u00a0Sadly, because it is very crowded the staff seems to get a bit irritated (for good reason) so if you want great service I wouldn't go at the end of a lunch/dinner rush. \u00a0Again, I'm all about the food so as long as they bring it to me I don't really care. Try it. \u00a0I have never had anything bad. \u00a0Wait in line and you'll thank me later.", 
      "This is shoot yo mama, lip smackin good.Way busy, always have to wait. \u00a0But it is worth it. The only problem with the place is that the staff never smiles. \u00a0They are just too busy, and it shows.The BBQ is awesome. \u00a0I believe I liked a peach BBQ sauce the best. \u00a0 The price is right. The place is like a diamond in the rough. \u00a0Yummy.", 
      "This place was good even if you have to wait. I ordered the beef brisket with georgia peach sauce it was tasty. I had the spicy potato salad, though the side was small it was homely and unique in that it was homemade. Also, I recommend getting the sauce platter unless you know for sure your sauce for bbq. It is just easier for you to pick and your know if the placr is any good. Also the waiter was nice filled our glasses on a regular basis. \u00a0He also made sure everybody seating had enough space to eat comfortably because its a small place. Will go back again for sure", 
      "This place is ok, I don't get all the rave reviews!!! Service was kinda bad, and it's too darn small in there ( I felt like it was a complete fire hazard). \u00a0The most troubling thing that I experienced was the gentleman working behind the bar go and grab a handful of cornbread concotion (with NO GLOVES ON) and put in on someones tray!!! I looked down at my cornbread concotion and push it away! Just wrong! and Hickory Rivers' pulled pork is soooo much better than this place!", 
      "Oh yeah, tasty. Was in town visiting a friend and she suggested we go here- yeah, it was the right choice. \u00a0The burnt ends were pretty great and so was most everything else i tried as well.", 
      "The Smoked Catfish sandwich with the Cabbage and Mustard sauce is a fantastic surprise. Make sure to order it after 5pm when the Baked Sweet Potatoes come out of the oven as your included side. I order this item religiously and guarantee you won't be disappointed.", 
      "I'm a fan of this place. the atmosphere is nice and the food is really good, possibly the best in town. Is it the best BBQ I've ever had in my life and justifies waiting 2 hours in line to only be told half the menu has been sold out? \u00a0Maybe not, but ordering for pick up is perfectly reasonable and an excellent choice.", 
      "Ive lived in Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia, and Mississippi. Having eaten more than my fair share of bbq in each of those states the Black Dog Smoke and Ale House in podunk Illinois is the best Ive had so far! BEWARE, theres never been a time ive gone to the Black Dog and not had to wait at least 30 min.", 
      "good", 
      "My son's \u00a0took me here when I was visiting them at School , this place was packed \u00a0and I loved the ambiance , the local Beer selection was \u00a0awesome \u00a0, \u00a0The Burnt \u00a0tips \u00a0, the pulled pork, \u00a0the brisket/ sausage , their corn bread \u00a0was great \u00a0I can't say enough about this place", 
      "I've heard such great things about this place and was anxious to give it a try.The night we went, their smoker was broken! \u00a0So all their famous barbecue dishes were unavailable! \u00a0Seems like they could have told us this before we waited 1/2 hour for a table! \u00a0We were hungry, so we stayed anyway, and had burgers. \u00a0They were decent, but I went there for barbecue!So if you go, you might want to ask when you get there if there are any problems in the kitchen...", 
      "You will see a line, possibly overflowing outside of the door. \u00a0It is there for a reason. \u00a0Find the gentleman or the lady taking the names for the queue and just wait... patiently... \u00a0Black Dog's food is a privilege rewarded only to the most patient and determined. \u00a0 Take a note of the daily lunch and dinner specials. \u00a0Some of those are really unique. \u00a0If they haven't run out of the burnt ends, get that. \u00a0Otherwise close your eyes and randomly point at something on the menu. \u00a0Doesn't matter really because everything is top notch. \u00a0If you are hungry, get the corn bread appetizer as well. \u00a0As far as the sides go, the casserole is a crowd favorite. \u00a0I also like the pit beans and the sweet potato fries. \u00a0If your item has bbq sauce, note that you have some options besides the house one, all of them offering a different flavor experience. \u00a0This place deserves 6 stars and then some.", 
      "If you are in the Urbana-Champaign area, dinning at this join is a must! Without a doubt they have great BBQ sauces, great rib tips, and overall its affordable!If your party consists of more than 2 people plan on a long wait. (at least 30-45 minutes) unless you come right when they open. Fox News placed Black Dog in Top 10 BBQ places in the US. Their service isn't quite top notch (Since this place is always crowded)Pros: good food, afforadable eat.Cons: long wait, average to below average serviceRecommendation: call in and place an order for pick up. Sit at home or park anywhere else and enjoy their delicious food without having to wait for long.", 
      "We've been going to Black Dog almost every week for the last couple of years. Great place if you don't mind the wait. If you mind the wait, go for lunch on weekdays or choose odd hours, when most people don't have their lunch or dinner. Most of their food is really good. I particularly like the pork belly sandwich and the rib tips.", 
      "this place has great food.unfortunately it has...long lines,a feeling of being rushed to get you in/out,and last night, warm beer while waited for my carryout.this place simply isn't a relaxing place to eat a meal.", 
      "Best place to eat in Champaign-Urbana area. Seriously this barbecue is as good as it gets. Lines can be long but if you go on the \"off hours\" in between meal times, the lines aren't long at all. Best thing I like to get is the carolina and texas burgers. Probably the best burger i've ever had! so yummy. I just love the barbecue sauce they use! It's so delicious! I bring all my friends and family here when they visit =]", 
      "We loved it. \u00a0Some if the best BBQ ever. \u00a0The corn bread was tops and the slaw tasty. \u00a0My wife is a vegetarian and when we discovered the corn bread and red beans and rice both have meat, the server could not have been more accommodating. \u00a0The beer selection is great and our meal was only $35 for two (and that's with two drinks each). \u00a0I may go back tomorrow for lunch!Late addition. \u00a0We went back and had another great experience. \u00a0This place is the bomb", 
      "I've been to Black Dog on awkward first dates, with a group of people I didn't know, and to lunch with an ex. And yet, I've never had an unpleasant experience at Black Dog. The burnt ends are basically legendary. I had never been there early enough to try them until yesterday. Yeah, they're amazing. It's no wonder they sell out before 12:45 pretty much every day. The barbecue is divine, the sauces fiery, the fries crispy, and the beer cold - and all for a terrific price (and friendly service!). Lunch for two with one appetizer, one sandwich, one platter, one soft drink and one beer - $32 before tip, and there were even some leftovers to take home. The only downside I can see, other than the occasional out-of-stock menu item, is the seating issue. There's definitely not enough space. However, they do make it fantastically easy to get a meal to-go, plus some relaxing outdoor seating for the warmer months. If you come with a group, make sure everyone is there on time, or you'll be waiting until the last person arrives, and then some. Still - it's worth the wait.", 
      "Black Dog is the best barbeque in the Champaign-Urbana area. The pulled pork sandwich and burnt ends are the greatest things on the menu. If you can, get sweet potato fries. They are also to die for. No reservations, so go at an off time, around 4 and you'll be set without a wait (probably). Try all the sauces! I love the Hot Georgia Peach, but the Carolina Red is always a favorite."

      "This is by far my absolute favorite restaurant in the Urbana-Champaign area. \u00a0Everything, literally everything, on the menu is delicious. Diverse beer selection, friendly and quirky wait staff, and great overall atmosphere. Get there early (before 5) because the place is small, and fills up quickly, especially on weekends. Sometimes they run out of burnt ends, but luckily there are plenty of other items that are just as good (I recommend the polish sausage). I love that you get to pick from a variety of sauces, which are all great; ask your server for a recommendation if you can't choose. Side dishes I highly recommend are the sweet potato fries, and the twice baked casserole.", 
      "Now I live in Philly and I want burnt ends for dinner tonight and I can't have them and it makes me want to cry.Black Dog, I love you.", 
      "After many years of living in Champaign/Urbana this is the place to take friends, guests, and all the like. The restaurant is a tad small but I think that adds immensely to its charm. The smells are fabulous and will have you drooling. There is usually a wait unless you come at an off meal time so expect that. The prices are reasonable and their is always a great beer selection to choose from. Love their weekly specials especially Cuban Sandwich Wednesday - brings back a lot of fond memories. Get there early though so they don't run out of what you want (:",

      "I \u00a0can be a bit critical of bbq, and I love this place. \u00a0The meat is good enough without sauce, and that's all I need.I recommend the smoked catfish. \u00a0I haven't had any smoked fish like this; it's amazing. The service is nice, kind waitress. \u00a0I guess they can run out of food. \u00a0That's kind of like the good bbq joints you would run across in the South. \u00a0Go early.", 
      "I love this place. \u00a0Plenty of people have written about the food (too many amazing dishes to list, but I could live on the sweet potato fries and the ribs) and the beer (the selection is so good, and it rotates, and it's so cold and delicious). \u00a0But once you get spoiled enough by the food, and you start to take it for granted, because after all you know that it will be fantastic and you don't care if you have to wait, and you don't even care if you have to sit at the weird little time out table in the very back, you start to ask yourself the hard questions. What exactly is it that makes this place so amazing? What is the one ingredient that brings it all into harmony? \u00a0Well, after twenty visits, I've figure it out. \u00a0It's that waiter. You know the one. The ironic hipster with the glasses and the longish hair who knows every single thing about all of the beer selections and all of the food and who is probably the guy responsible for the fact that Tom Waits is playing and you can just hear it under the really loud sound of the game on the tv at the bar. \u00a0This guy is free from the shackles of his hipster tribe, because he's nice. He's kind. \u00a0He will figure you out and he will use this knowledge responsibly. \u00a0This guy will tell you everything you need to know. He will not patronize you, rush you, brush you off, or forget your table. \u00a0He will shine his magical hipster/doofus sparkle charm on you. \u00a0He is the patron saint of this restaurant. Go there and ask him to tell you what to eat and what to drink. \u00a0Obey him. \u00a0Thank him. \u00a0Seriously, who is this guy? \u00a0I love this guy.", 
      "My dear black dogs, the best place I've ever eaten at in my life. \u00a0I left Illinois a while ago and sadly have never found a place in the North or Western states that can compare. \u00a0I remember how the sauces were so good I'd shred the meat so it could get as much surface area of sauce as possible, cleaning out each cup of sauce.Thank you for putting soul into food. \u00a0I've been a barbeque fan since",

      "It always amuses me how a place becomes the \"In\" spot in town and then shows an arrogance towards its customers that conveys the sense of superiority. \u00a0It's like they're doing you a favor by serving you, rather than you doing them a favor by patronizing the place. \u00a0It's too bad because the food is good, although not the sublime experience that some people claim. \u00a0Yes, the burnt ends are delicious -- if you can ever get them. \u00a0Forget about seating. \u00a0Forget about customer service. Get take out, if you can find someone who will condescend to wait on you. \u00a0For the food I'd give four stars but for the general dining experience, two is the best I can muster. \u00a0The beer selection is decent but not spectacular for a true beer lover. \u00a0I agree with Dan W.: Good food, bad service.", 
      "My perspective: I've spent a good deal of time in Austin, Texas, which is the center of the BBQ loop trail that goes through tiny towns like Taylor, Lockhart, and Fredericksburg. The places in these towns are like institutions, with heritage and loyalty passed down from one generation to the next. People are on a first-name basis with the cutter and pit man.My all-time favorite: Franklin BBQ, which was recently named best bbq in America by Bon Appetit. It's also gotten rave reviews from the NY Times, Food and Wine, and the only perfect rating from fcg-bbq, a bbq joint blog with its nose seriously to the ground, and whose opinion I take to be more authoritative than any national magazine.I know BBQ is more than what Texans call 'brisket', but when done right, brisket is so good that it's hard to see what else one could want from BBQ.If you're looking for what Texans call ' wet brisket' or 'moist brisket', here's how to get the most out of Black Dog: go from Sunday to Thursday when the pit man Jay is working. The wet brisket ( or what people around here call 'burnt ends') is best in the evenings.Order a burnt ends platter, and ASK YOUR SERVER TO NOT TRIM ANY FAT. Tell him or her that you want about a 50-50 meat/fat ratio with plenty of the fat webbing between the little nodules of meat.Ask for sauce only on the side. Ideally, you won't be needing any.Make sure to ask for white onions, because they default to red. And pickles. And try to get some white bread.If it's at all dry or tough, talk to your server and send it back.Jay will know what you're looking for. He has been to Texas. He will speak your language.", 
      "BBQ has become a religious experience at black dog.", 
      "My buddy and I went there on a Saturday night around 7-I'd never been there but heard it was good and i'm kind of chubby, ex post facto, I dig barbeque. Anyhow I went in there and ordered burnt ends (the bartender scoffed that I would attempt to order those after 6, I guess they're always out after that time) Anyhow so I just got a pulled pork sandwich with some slaw on top and sweet potato fries. The food all in all was great as well with the service. Even the craft beer left me wanting more. \u00a0While the place is small it has kind of a more \u00a0homey feel rather than cramped. I'll definitely eat there again and maybe try to get there before 6 next time!", 
      "Black Dog you are my friend, my lover. \u00a0Your slow-smoked brisket, your hand-made sides, your succulent rib-tips attract me with the magnetism of a particle accelerator. \u00a0You introduced me to the joy of cider; you do Arnold Palmer justice. \u00a0Oh Black Dog, oh Black Dog.", 
      "I used to live near this place and every time when \u00a0I drive \u00a0pass by \u00a0it , it's always full of people waiting in line. So, when my parents visited me this time. I took them to this place. They both loved the food and the drinks here. My dad loves to drink and he told me this place is one the best pubs he has been to. I personally love the BBQ ribs, it is the best one I ever had. One thing worth mention is you gotta wait in line for awhile before you can be seated.", 
      "Perhaps my favorite restaurant in Urbana/Champaign! I've heard they have a second location in the works...I'm hoping it has a larger dining area. As it stands now, expect a wait...but know that it is VERY much worth it!", 
      "This place has a ton of hype! I eat there every so often, but I still have not found a BBQ sauce that I particularly like. Nevertheless, the BBQ is so good I eat it without!Baked Potato Casserole is my favorite side, usually get two of them. Be prepared to wait and make sure your whole party is there otherwise they won't seat you. Great whiskey flights, good service.", 
      "Wow, I love the black dog. The first time I had gone there i had the catfish. Amazing. 2nd time, beef tips. Also amazing. It's cheap, friendly, and has great food. The only downside, limited space. I had to wait around half an hour before i could be seated, but it was well worth the wait. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant to ANYBODY because I don't want to have to wait even longer for my little piece of BBQ heaven. Best BBQ in Chambana.", 
      "As good as it gets. \u00a0Best ribs I've ever had, as well as best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had. \u00a0Service is alright but its a packed bar, what do you expect?", 
      "I was in town from Chicago visiting my friend for the weekend and she suggested this place when I told her I was craving bbq. She spoke very highly of it and I was so excited to try it!!! I would like to say first and foremost that I have been in the restaurant/bar industry for around 6 years and I know what it is like to work in a busy environment...though there was a wait, it was NOT busy enough to provide THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.We arrived and the hostess (a gentleman) greeted us with a face of annoyance. I saw an extra chair at the bar and asked if we could pull up an extra one and sit there. With annoyance he answered with \"Not right now.\" We were never told that the bar was also a part of the seating wait. We asked how long the wait was and received yet another look of annoyance stating there were sixteen tables waiting ahead of us with no time frame. I really wanted to try the food so we decided to take it to go. By this time I was upset considering, like i previously mentioned, I work in the industry and know how to give customer service to build rapport. I asked the guy taking our order if the hostess was the owner and he informed me that the hostess wasn't but he in fact was the owner, omitting to ask if there was something he could do for us. I did not mention what horrible service we were receiving because I like to be more professional but while we were waiting for our food we over heard two other customers become disappointed at the responses they were receiving from the hostess. Honestly though the food was good my friend nor I will EVER come back here. Come on dude, step up your game if your gonna be a popular place in a small town. AWFUL SERVICE!!!!", 
      "I don't get it. \u00a0This place is always packed. \u00a0There are always lines outside waiting to get in so I tried it. \u00a0The food, in my opinion, was terrible. \u00a0I didn't like the bbq at all. \u00a0Granted the sweet fries were delicious but everything else was awful. \u00a0My friend who was with me at the time, hated the food too. \u00a0Everyone else says its good food so try it for yourself, but as far as I'm concern keep trucking pass this dog.", 
      "Well I had heard and read all the hype. \u00a0We went on Sat. around 3 and there was very little wait (5min). \u00a0The ribs, pulled pork and collard greens were good but not the best I had every had. \u00a0Six beers on tap all leaning towards IPA and a huge selection of bottled beer. \u00a0Not worth an hours wait. \u00a0The sauces are tomato based. \u00a0Neat little bar with good BBQ. \u00a0Super selection of Bourbon, whisky and rye. \u00a0Samplers of beer and whisky are available. \u00a0Wait staff are super.", 
      "This place was too hyped up for me. Not perfect. I had better barbecue elsewhere but it's as good as gets in Illinois. I would recommend the pulled pork and briskets. Get there early for the burnt tips and to avoid the lines! The line does form quickly in this small place.", 
      "Amazing beef brisket, tasty BBQ sauce, and good selection of beers.", 
      "Although I cannot boast a lifelong relationship with BBQ, I know what my taste buds are fans of, and Black Dog is it. Wednesdays are Cuban sandwiches and a side of the twice-baked potato. We have been here for dinner as well, when I had the privilege of eating a delicious polish. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly and on top of things. My only complaint is how busy they are, but the food is so good that I will not withhold stars just because it takes me a few minutes to get seated.", 
      "Small place. We went on a Tuesday and waited only 5 minutes. There were four of us and we split two combo dishes. Everything we had was amazing. Chicken, pulled pork, beef brisket, and sausage. 5 stars from everyone.", 
      "Update: \u00a0Ok, I had dinner at the Black Dog. \u00a0The ribs were to die for, the beer selection makes me feel like I've gone to brew heaven, and the service was good. \u00a0Now only if they were open on Sundays...This place pretty much does what it needs to!Great beer selection, \"real\" lemonaide, awesome meat, ok service. \u00a0I didn't have a single complaint!It beats the pants off of the other bbq places in town for taste and offerings. Yum!", 
      "Good smoked meats, good beers, and good prices. What more could you ask for?", 
      "Outstanding! \u00a0Loved everything I have ever eaten here. \u00a0Well worth the wait and trust me, you will usually have a wait (20-30 minutes). \u00a0Small venue but so incredibly good. \u00a0Real smoked pork and brisket. \u00a0The smoked salmon is tremendous and the twice baked casserole. \u00a0Beer selection rotates almost weekly and they even have something on cask most of the time. \u00a0There is ample parking on street and in an adjoining lot. \u00a0More seating would make it perfect!", 
      "Best BBQ I've ever had, everything else I try across the country just fails in comparison. Casual and welcoming environment. The staff is wonderful and the infused liquor is delish. Anytime the husband and I visit IL, this place is an absolute \"must\".", 
      "Some of the best beef brisket I've ever had - sauce is not necessary. There's usually a wait but you won't regret it. I ate here the first week they opened and the quality of the BBQ astounded me at the time - it has only gotten better since. I hope it does well because the trip to Urbana is faster than driving to 17th Street BBQ in Murphysboro. The Pit Beans are totally necessary as a side. They also have a decent beer selection with some good microbrews on tap.", 
      "Black Dog is the best BBQ I've had. The meat always comes out perfectly tender, and I like the fact they give you a choice of sauces. All of the sides are excellent. I usually order the pulled pork and the brisket, although I occasionally will get a hot link. For sides, the twice baked potatoes and pit beans are probably my favorites, with honorable mention going to the sweet potato fries.I also have tried the burritos (only served at lunch time) and they were excellent.I live in Chicago now (after living in Urbana for about 6.5 years), and I have been unable to find a BBQ place in Chicago that even comes close to Black Dog. This came as a huge surprise to me since I just assumed somewhere in Chicago there'd be something this good, but it has just been a series of disappointments. When I want BBQ, what I really want is Black Dog.I recently went down to visit Urbana, partially for an excuse to eat here. The beer selection at Black Dog is also phenomenal. I discovered several relatively obscure beers I had never heard that have since become regular favorites. (New Holland Dragons Milk being one of them). I think Black Dog has a more interesting beer selection than the Blind Pig some of the time.Be prepared to wait a while, but the wait is worth it. They might want to consider expanding to a larger location, one always worries about that since it might mess with success. I think they could probably sustain it though considering this is almost a regional draw.", 
      "The food here is LEGIT. The prices are pretty good. Their beer selection is kind of weird but hey try something new.", 
      "I'm not even much of a BBQ fan, but this place is excellent! \u00a0By far the best place for for barbecue in the CU. \u00a0Loved the pulled pork, burnt ends, even the fries were great! \u00a0The potato casserole is amazing. \u00a0Good beer selection. \u00a0Fun, casual bar atmosphere and the food comes out on metal pans :)Get here early, because it's a small space and fills up quick. \u00a0There is usually quite a line, sometimes out the door. \u00a0It's worth it!", 
      "This is a smallish place. \u00a0We arrived for a late weekend lunch and waited about 20 minutes for a table. \u00a0The restaurant is long and narrow. At the front is an area with a few high-top tables. There is a long bar with several bar stools. \u00a0Against the wall and opposite the bar are booths.The menu includes a variety of bottled and draft craft beers. We enjoyed a wheat beer while we waited for our table. \u00a0The menu is devoted to barbecue. \u00a0Our starters included cornbread (very different from what I've tried in the past as it included peppers) and smoked wings accompanied by a North Carolina sauce and a blue-cheese dip on the side. \u00a0We ordered sandwiches, all of which were uniformly excellent (a pulled-pork sandwich, a brisket sandwich and a pulled chicken sandwich). They were accompanied by a North Carolina sauce \u00a0(you can request another sauce) and side dishes. The baked potato casserole was something like a twice-baked potato minus the potato skin and was also very good. \u00a0The food was so good we didn't mind the wait at all.", 
      "This was one of our favorite places in grad school, hands down. \u00a0Each of my friends groups loved this place and it's great for takeout so I must have been here over 30 times in two years. \u00a0And now that I've moved to a region with crappy BBQ, I dream of Black Dog's brisket and wonder why I moved here. Job, schmob.I've been coming here ever since the first week they opened and they've really come a long way. \u00a0The food was always delicious, but they ironed out the kinks and expanded the menu. Everything is delicious. \u00a0You really can't go wrong.The ribs, brisket and pulled pork are AMAZING. \u00a0The brisket is my favorite, hands down. I've had brisket at other places and it's dry or fatty or lacking in flavor. Not Black Dog. I've never had bad brisket here. I've never had bad ANYTHING here.The sides are just stunning. \u00a0I had a recurring problem with underdone smoked sweet potatoes but no one else had this problem. I must be cursed. When they're fully done, they're delicious, just check them before you leave if you get takeout. \u00a0The fries and sweet potato fries are crisp and delicious. In about 20 orders, we've never had soggy or greasy fries. \u00a0The potato casserole is okay but it's a bit bland. \u00a0Their homemade smoked bleu cheese dressing \u00a0is also fabulous. \u00a0And I'd consider composing an ode to their cornbread.They also did theme nights, where they'd put on special dinners. \u00a0There was a night with local meats from Triple S Farms, a beer night, and a Thanksgiving dinner. \u00a0All delicious. Notice a theme, here? \u00a0I miss you guys!", 
      "Hands down - best barbeque place (and best restaurant, in my opinion) in the Champaign/Urbana area! I've tried almost everything on the menu, and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the spare ribs with a smoked sweet potato.There's usually a really long wait to be seated if you go during dinner hours (6-9pm), but if you are willing to sit at the bar, its not too bad. Well worth it!", 
      "Okay, so we read reviews of this joint rating the BBQ excellent, best ever, I died and went to heaven, ranked #2 in the US by Fox-something for BBQ and decided to venture off our course from St. Louis to Indy to visit Urbana IL and this incredible place to eat. Correctly reviewed, there was a wait at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening. We signed in on the board as soon as we arrived (again, thanks to a review) - good to know this or we would have been standing around outside in the brisk weather until we happened to figure it out. We waited about a half hour and were seated at the bar. Service was okay, not stellar. So we ordered the \"burnt ends\". I'm not sure what we should have expected, but two fatty slices of brisket were not to my liking. If you like fatty prime rib, then you will be in heaven. The rib tips had a good flavor, were a bit on the tough side for me, hubby enjoys chewing so he didn't mind them. The sauces were just okay, hubby didn't like any we tried and we were charged extra for each sauce. The cornbread was good. Overall, this a good BBQ place, not the best we have eaten, not the worst we have eaten. Not a place for cheap beer - one draft cost $6.00. \u00a0We have a much better BBQ join in Indianapolis - if you ever drive thru, try Squealers.", 
      "Black Dog is, hands down, my favorite restaurant is Champaign Urbana. \u00a0I first visited when it opened and have been back many many times, bringing new people with me each time and converting them into Black Dog lovers just like me. \u00a0The BBQ here is fantastic (declared by a St. Louis girl)! \u00a0Whatever you do, you must order their Burnt Ends, either in Sandwich form or as an appetizer. \u00a0The pulled pork sandwich and ribs are also great choices, but nothing beats their Burnt Ends. \u00a0Another great appetizer is the Texas Caviar, a delicious salsa made with black eyed peas and hominy. \u00a0As far as bbq sauce goes, my personal favorite is the Hot Georgia Peach. \u00a0It's the perfect mix of a spicy bbq sauce and the sweetness of the regular Georgia Peach sauce. \u00a0And the sweet potato fries...oh, the sweet potato fries. \u00a0What I wouldn't give to have some right now. \u00a0I'm not even going to tell you how good they are, you just need to have some for yourself.This place also has a great beer selection and the servers are friendly and obliging in offering out recommendations. \u00a0My friends and I all agree that this place reminds you of a neighborhood bar that you would find in Chicago. \u00a0A nice change of pace from all the typical campus bars in CU. Some tips on dining here: it gets packed and fast! \u00a0Part of Black Dog's charm is that it's a small bar. \u00a0Unfortunately, that means limited seating. \u00a0If you want to get a seat before the rush, try to get there before noon for lunch (they open at 11am), or before 5:30 for dinner. \u00a0If you happen to find a long line when you get there. Don't leave!! Stick it out! It's worth it."

      "The only problem with Black Dog is that they are always packed! \u00a0But that is because they are SSSOOOOOOOOO GGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDD!!!Believe me it is worth the wait. \u00a0Best BBQ in town, and in Illinois (as far as I know). \u00a0Get the corn bread, it is something else.", 
      "I wasn't expecting to taste great barbecue in Illinois, but Black Dog surprised me! \u00a0I enjoyed the smoked chicken, made with local free range chicken. \u00a0I love that Black Dog uses local ingredients! \u00a0The food is delicious & the service was great too!", 
      "We had been holding out going here for a long time because I don't eat meat and I had heard that the only non meat item on the menu was a grilled cheese! \u00a0Well was I ever wrong! \u00a0The menu offers quite a few items for non meat eaters, a smoked catfish, salmon (on Friday and Saturday) a falafel \u00a0plate AND a grilled cheese! \u00a0My son and husband started off with wings and then moved on to the burnt end sandwiches, one choosing potato salad the other choosing fries and i had the smoked catfish. \u00a0Always health conscious I had to ensure that the items were not fried and the extremely friendly and helpful waitress assured me, no they were only smoked. \u00a0All I can say is WE ARE CONVERTS!!!! \u00a0No other barbeque places for us anymore. \u00a0My husband and son agreed that 10 out of 10 times they would get the burnt ends sandwich(one note to others-this does run out). \u00a0As for my catfish? \u00a0Delicious, mouth watering, healthy and left me wanting to come back often-thanks Black Dog for offering outstanding BBQ for us all!!!!!", 
      "Literally the best restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area. The BBQ is phenomenal and you will never find a better burger.", 
      "Excellent food and service. I enjoyed the burnt tips + potato salad. My friend's sweet potato fries were tasty. Sauce has a good kick! Dine early - \u00a0minimum seating.", 
      "The problems I listed in my last review with the dodgy sweet (now called \"Georgia Peach\") bbq sauce and the sweet tea have been corrected. That means my review is now all good! \u00a0Feel free to order it sweet.", 
      "Oh Black Dog...how much do I love you? Let me count the ways :) Simply, one of the best bbq places I have ever visited.Just thinking about it and I start to salivate.", 
      "Best. Place. Ever. Chicken wings taste like they were cooked over a campfire, after eating them my hands smell good for hours. Sweet potato fries are probably the best I've ever had.Last time I went, they had a smoked portobella mushroom sandwich which is nice because before the only vegetarian option was grilled cheese (and the aforementioned sweet potato fries, and a couple other sides.)Large beer menu - not a perk for me since I don't drink beer- but my friends love it.Over all, fantastic place. oh and awesome service too. Always have been overly friendly. Wonderful!!!", 
      "After a few years, I'm sorry to downgrade my initial 5-star review. Here are the reasons:1. The prices have increased substantially in the last few years. It's no longer a great value. If you buy a sandwich, side, and a drink, you're spending around $13 (counting tax and tip). Yeah, I get that some of their meat is coming from local farms and stuff and it's more expensive as a result. I really don't care. The use of local animals has priced me out of the restaurant. 2. The wait times are completely unacceptable. Unless you eat between 2-4pm, you can count on a wait of around 30-45 minutes. It's okay if you want this to be your major activity of the night, but sadly, it's no longer a place where you can stop in for a quick and inexpensive BBQ sandwich. The mix of inconvenience and increased cost has led me to downgrade my review of what was formerly one of my favorite restaurants. Also, I'm not nearly as impressed with the quality of the food after trying Smoque BBQ in Chicago. Previously, I thought that Black Dog was amongst the best BBQ in the nation, but as good as it is, there is no comparison to Smoque when it comes to the meat.", 
      "I finally was able to eat at the Black Dog, and I am still trying to understand the hype. \u00a0Possibly people in Urbana don't experience good BBQ, but I grew up eating delicious food and this was just ok. \u00a0The seating options were limited and the wait was long. \u00a0The waitress was busy but not as attentive as I hoped. \u00a0It took a while to get something to drink, but I understood that it was packed and she was busy, so I'll give her a break. I ordered the combo: ribs and catfish with the Carolina house sauce on the side. \u00a0The plate arrives with small portions and a side of the worst sauce I have ever tasted. \u00a0The way the food is cooked must be particular to a certain region because it is not like the Memphis, Kentucky and Texas style I grew up eating. \u00a0It was full of vinegar, spicy and nasty. \u00a0The meat was tender, which it should be because it was smoked for 4 1/2 hours, and I wouldn't have expected anything less. \u00a0After eating here, I wasn't impressed. So many people have talked about how great the food was, and I should have known better. \u00a0The food was okay, and I must say I've had better barbecue in my own backyard.", 
      "Food is good. Been there several times with great experiences, but this time the owner was horribly rude to my party. A couple of our friends stopped by briefly to say hello and he tried to be a bouncer and kick them out. \u00a0Unacceptable. \u00a0It's a \u00a0shame when people in the service industry lack manners.", 
      "Let me start by saying the food is great. Pulled pork and sweet potato fries. Yum. Why did I give it one star? The black hair in my lemonade. Hairs fall out. I get that. Accidents happen. But when I politely asked the guy working behind the bar for a new glass (we were seated at the bar) he looked at me with a puzzled look. I pointed down (so others enjoying their food would not hear about the problem). He grabbed a new glass and gave it to me. And 5 minutes later when handed my bill - by him - he didn't even comp my lemonade. I guess I should be happy it wasn't a short and curly black hair since I'd downed 1/2 the glass before noticing it.Food = goodService - they act like you're lucky to be there.", 
      "This place is easily my FAVORITE bbq joint in Chambana. I was beyond pleased with the food when it first opened (before the liquor license even), and even more thrilled now that there is a full bar and decent beer selection. The last time I went, the restaurant was offering beer flights. It was my bad luck that the flight they had that week was all dark beers (not my fave) but they do change the offerings in the flight. I always get the burnt ends (when they're not sold out) and sweet potato fries, but the Cuban sandwich special is also delicious. PS - try the different bbq sauces!", 
      "Amazing place for BBQ. Their pulled pork is amongst the best I've tasted. The Amish Chicken platter was equally good.", 
      "Great food. It's indicative by the long lines at lunch and dinner time. Which I would say is the only downfall to the place. It's small, but the kitchen moves pretty fast for it's size. The food is delicious, I've tried something new every time I've gone and have yet to be disappointed.", 
      "I'm not really a fan of BBQ (that's why I've waited this long to come here eventhough it gets great reviews), but I really enjoyed my meal here. I've always thought of BBQ as something people put together during the summer, not the kind of food you need to go to a restaurant for, but Black Dog's BBQ was simply the best I've ever had (but I guess that doesn't say much for a person who doesn't really go to restaurants that serve BBQ). \u00a0Definitely coming back here again.", 
      "Great food, great flavor, great smells, great atmosphere. I love this place! Even their salad with pulled pork on top is delicious. \u00a0You want to eat here.", 
      "Amazing barbeque. Like most people, I love the burnt ends. The blue cheese burger is also amazing. The Texas caviar is a favorite side. They are one of the few places in town with absinthe behind the bar (Seven Saints is the only other one I'm aware of), and they make a delicious sazerac cocktail. The staff is nice. Steve up front can seem a little on the serious side, but I would be too if I was trying to manage the crowd of people who pack in that little area.", 
      "Other than the 20 minute wait, this place offers a good meal. Heard much about their smoked beef brisket and decided to go with the smoked pork belly platter. I'll be back to try all their other entrees as well. Sitting at the bar rail is cool to.", 
      "Tonight was our first visit to the Black Dog. We had the rib platter with two sides. The ribs were extremely tasty and tender but a little light on the meat side. The twice baked potatoes were outstanding and sweet potato fries were also very tasty. We also had a side of the chicken wings. They were the very very best wings, perfectly done tender and just the right spice. With the sauces that come are not required on the meats. The sauces add a lot of extra flavor. I will definitely be back here in another month when I return.", 
      "I didn't expect such a crowd for lunch in the summer, but I guess this place is popular with people working at the courthouse nearby. The place has a great lively atmosphere and decor featuring...surprise! cute dogs! The best thing was that the ingredients are fairly high quality, they try to use local meat when they can and their sauces are delicious.", 
      "Maybe I just over-hyped this place in my mind, but I felt sort of let down after eating at Black Dog. \u00a0I had the beef brisket sandwich and the double baked potato side--both good, but definitely not great. \u00a0I came here at 1 PM on a Wednesday and missed out on the \"burnt ends\", so a chance to try those may bring me back to give this place another shot. \u00a0That said, it's a good place to grab a quick, cheap lunch--definitely a nice change of pace from any chain restaurant. \u00a0Oh, and they only had one bartender serving a packed bar, so the service was somewhat lacking.", 
      "Great food! Nice little BBQ place, not that many seats so get there early! They have a variety of BBQ sauces that are delicious. The specials are good but you have to get there early because they run out fast! Definitely a place to go in the CU area!", 
      "Burnt ends, not brisket. \u00a0Can't speak for the ribs or pulled pork. \u00a0Stuffed cornbread did not fit the menu's description (was mixed with the ingredients instead of stuffed), but was glorious. \u00a02 sticks of butter will make anything good.", 
      "Beer flights and food were amazing here!! \u00a0We had a very cool server and the atmosphere makes you want to stay and drink several beer flights! \u00a0Best BBQ in Chambana!", 
      "Not that big of a place so you may have to wait. \u00a0 Cornbread app is interesting flavorful. 5 stars for the beef brisket, very moist BBQ chicken and the burnt tips. \u00a0If you like spicy-ish sauce go with the Carolina. \u00a0If you like sweet and awesome try the Georgia peach. \u00a0 Yum", 
      "A pretty diverse drink menu, filled with many craft brews & ciders. The smoked pulled pork & beef brisket were delicious & generous in portion size. This place is always busy around typical meal times, but usually quiet in between. (We go around 3 or 4pm & sit right down.) Try the burnt ends if they aren't sold out for the day!", 
      "Ahh, the bi-fecta... Southern style BBQ + Midwestern beers. I've swapped out the usual pulled pork for some burnt ends, when I can get my hands on them (early lunch!).. brisket's tasty too (sliced and super tender). Only one request: whip up this girl some mustard sauce!", 
      "There's little I can add that hasn't already been said. \u00a0Except maybe this. \u00a0Best chicken wings I have ever eaten. \u00a0Ever.", 
      "The place smells great as soon as you walk in. I had the brisket & burnt ends platter. It was very good. I'm not a big fan of their type of cole slaw but that's just me. Their potato casserole was very good as well. Great beer selection and fun atmosphere. I would definitely go back.", 
      "Monday lunch @ 12:30 wasn't too crowded; large menu with a good selection; sides like sweet potato fries; spicy potato salad were both good; \u00a0great sandwiches at reasonable price; very good beer selection and offer a beer flight of current on tap; look forward to an evening meal to try the entree menu.", 
      "Burnt ends are excellent, and they always run out early in the evening. Rib tip platter is very tasty and they give generous portions. I like sweet BBQ sauces, so I really enjoyed the Georgia Peach. You can really taste the peach in it. All of the sandwiches are highly recommended.", 
      "Great barbeque, variety of sauces, super tasty specials, superb rotating beers. \u00a0You must try the cornbread...it has bbq meat in it! \u00a0My fave is the tacos with pork and chipotle sauce.", 
      "Hands down, best BBQ place in the C/U area. I know that's not saying a lot but this place is legit. I have eaten here more times than I can count and I have had almost everything on the menu, and I have NEVER had something I didn't like. I always get the wings as an appetizer and they are amazing! my favorite thing on the menu is the cuban sandwich which you can only get on Wednesdays but I seriously live for them. The only thing that sucks is the seating, there is always a wait but this place is worth waiting for :)", 
      "Burnt ends sandwich with twice baked potato casserole simply delicious! Friendly and welcoming bar staff!", 
      "This place was packed, line out of the door, but the staff were very efficient, fair, composed, and super nice as they managed the ever-growing crowd. \u00a0Very good Nosferatu beer on tap along with great pulled pork and sides. \u00a0Fries had an unusually delicious flavor - not sure if that was the potato or the oil. \u00a0Our waiter was terrific. \u00a0 Rolls of paper towels on every table. The only thing I'd suggest is that BBQ sauces are available at tables/booths or they are described in detail - the basic sauce they offered me was too spicy for my liking when it comes to pulled pork. \u00a0I don't know how many other sauces they had on hand or what they were like, but I would have liked to experiment at the table.", 
      "All I have to say is amazing food, amazing beer , whether you live here or are out of town.... TRY IT! You will not be disappointed .", 
      "Black Dog is a new favorite. I've had their chicken, pork, and brisket sandwiches plus their catfish. Pulled pork is my favorite sandwich. Love the Carolina sauce and the crunch from the slaw is outstanding. And you can't beat the burnt ends. They literally melt in your mouth. Sweet potato fries are a solid side but pit beans are the best. Great selection of beers. This is not a very big place and I regularly have to wait for a table, but it's well worth it.", 
      "Without a doubt their food is fantastic. Every time I've been here I have been very satisfied with the quality of food and selection of beers. I've had a variety of dishes and sides and they deserve the rating of top restaurant in Champaign!Their service on the other hand...is a different story. Perhaps they can get away with this because of the high quality food but there should be a limit to how poorly they treat customers. Examples of this include being put on hold for 5 minutes when calling for take out, hanging up and then calling back to immediately have my order taken but no apology. When dining in, I don't mind the long wait for a table but when I am seated, I have not even had a server come to my table for 10 or 15 minutes. Again, great food but don't expect great service!"

      "We drove an hour and a half to eat here one last time before moving out east. \u00a0This place keeps getting busier. Good, he should expand! \u00a0Minus one star for always running out of food. \u00a0I know, it's typical of smokehouses, but still... \u00a0I always request to get the Georgia Peach bbq sauce, I could seriously drink that stuff. \u00a0No other smokehouse I've been to has ever had a sauce I find even remotely as delicious. \u00a0I also love the cornbread. \u00a0To drink, I get the jalapeno pineapple margarita, it's a very good combination of flavors. \u00a0I love that they serve the food on metal trays too.", 
      "I have yet to eat something here I don't like. Ask anyone who knows me, I am picky and this is the ONLY place I have been that I like everything I have ordered. I cannot say enough good things about this place. I guess the only negative is everytime I go in there is around a 30min wait for a table, but it is worth it, and I think they need a kids menu. I am moving to the St.Louis area and I am going to miss this place! I am going to have to find excuses to come up!", 
      "...I don't know why I waited so long to try this place, I've heard so much about it. \u00a0I had the burnt ends BBQ sandwich + twice baked potatoes + Sioux City Ginger Beer (non-alcoholic) which was a great combination. \u00a0 \u00a0If you're up for BBQ sauce that's thick, spicy + sweet this is the place for you!", 
      "The Black Dog has great food, great beer, and a great atmosphere. \u00a0Unfortunately, everyone in town is in on the secret. \u00a0Do not go here if you are in a hurry or looking for a quiet place to take your date. \u00a0 Go here only if you are willing to sacrifice a little convenience in order to gorge yourself on some of the best food in town. \u00a0 There doesn't seem to be a weak spot on the Black Dog's menu. \u00a0As other people have mentioned, the pulled pork is exceptional, but right now I'm hung up on the free-range Amish chicken. \u00a0Whether you get it as a breast or as a thigh and a wing, you won't be disappointed. \u00a0It is moist, succulent, and pairs well with their homemade sauce. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In my experience, the service is pretty good given the circumstances. \u00a0Yes, you will have to wait fifteen minutes to a half hour to get a seat, but eventually your turn will come. \u00a0Moreover, since it's a barbecue joint, it doesn't take too long for your food to come after that. \u00a0The restaurant would probably benefit from an expansion or a move to a larger location, but for food this good, I'm willing to brave a short wait for the time being.", 
      "Their barbeque is the best in town. Everything they make is freshly made from scratch, even the tasty lemonade. In addition to the barbeque, I like the potato casserole and the corn bread with pork inside. I usually order my food to go since it is a popular restaurant and if you plan to eat there at dinner time, you will have to wait a very long time.", 
      "Good bbq and good beer. Enough said. Get the texas breakfast drink with a garnish of bacon. Me and my buddy Aaron's invention. Ask for it!!", 
      "Ate at The Black Dog with our kids today. \u00a0AMAZING bbq place in Urbana. \u00a0They smoke all their own meat and everything was great. \u00a0My husband had the brisket, I had pulled pork, our son had burned ends and his girl had jumbalya. \u00a0Everything was perfect. \u00a0This is a small place, so don't expect to sit right down. \u00a0They also have some great brews and full bar. \u00a0I would absolutely go again!", 
      "On BBQ alone, just the meat, I think Lil Porgy's is just as good, but certain things make this better in my mind:-Side dishes are far superior-They serve beer-Burnt ends, when you can get themThe really big downside is that the space is tiny, making the wait extremely long. They will do takeout if you call in, I highly recommend this option.", 
      "Yes! Finally went to Black Dog. Since I moved to Champaign I have been constantly hearing about this place and I was dying to go. \u00a0We ordered the cornbread because I was told to try it, but I wasn't a huge fan. It was good, just not for me. I love pulled pork so, naturally, that's what I ordered. I wanted to try two sides so I got the platter. I had the slaw and the potato salad, both of which were awesome. \u00a0The pulled pork was delicious, and the sauce they give you was beyond good. I also tried a bite of my friend's cuban sandwich, and it was also delicious. The service was also decent, and the restaurant is pretty nice overall. The only thing I can see being a problem is the size of it. It is definitely a small place and apparently they get a pretty long line at certain times. We went on a Wednesday afternoon and got a table right away though. Can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu!BASICALLY JUST GO. GO NOW.", 
      "Burnt ends, fresh lemonade and a pulled pork sandwich. I'm in heaven.", 
      "Love the specials. The Cuban is the best.", 
      "Cool dive bar setting. Great service. The burnt ends were the best I've ever had, but I have had better sauce.", 
      "Best BBQ I've probably ever had. The only reason it gets 4 stars is the wait is too long. So much that I won't go here on a Friday or Saturday night because of the wait. I'd eat here a lot more if I didn't have to wait so long. Otherwise the food is excellent.", 
      "Though the lines can be long and they occasionally run out of the really good stuff, a trip to Black Dog is worth planning your whole day around.I was especially happy and surprised to find a place serving Carolina style bbq!", 
      "This place is doing it right. \u00a0I had the beef brisket today and you could cut it with a fork. \u00a0Add sweet potato fries and red Carolina sauce and you have a GREAT meal. \u00a0Also had smoked corn on the cob and it was outstanding. \u00a0This is a must if you are in or near downtown Urbana.", 
      "Walking up to the door you are hit with the smell of SMOKE!! I have tried the pulled pork, brisket and ribs. All some of the best!!! The sauce has a good kick. Small interior but worth the wait....there will be a wait! The beans are BBQ tasty and the potatoe salad is a solid one. Highly recommend it!!", 
      "Most excellent BBQ in the midwest. \u00a0Great variety of sauces to try. \u00a0Get the burnt ends if they are still available when you get there (they come off the smoker at 11 am and 5 pm). \u00a0Also after 5 pm they have a smoked sweet potato. \u00a0Also they have a great rotating tap list so check them out throughout the year.", 
      "Loved everything we had. \u00a0Too bad the place isnt bigger, because it was completely packed while we were there. \u00a0Really wanted the burnt tips, but they were gone before we got there.", 
      "We visited Black Dog tonight for the first time and now have a new favorite BBQ restaurant. \u00a0My husband got the rib tips and I had burnt ends and pulled pork. \u00a0They were all amazing. \u00a0We also had the cornbread...so, so good. \u00a0I had potato salad and pit beans for my sides and the smoke flavor of the beans was seriously out of this world. \u00a0I really could imagine myself sitting out at my grandma's farm during our yearly family cookout, which might sound cheesy but it was that good. \u00a0We both had the house sauce, which was good but I will probably try something a bit milder next time. \u00a0The staff was VERY friendly. \u00a0I felt like I was just hanging out with my friends at a bar that happened to have incredible BBQ too. \u00a0Everything was outstanding and although we got there early enough that we didn't have to wait, we would have been more than happy to.", 
      "Black Dog is hands down some of the best bbq I have ever eaten. I love their cuban sandwich (Wednesday only), their cornbread, their chicken wings, and their pulled pork sandwich. I think the burnt ends are overrated.", 
      "A group of four of us visiting the U of IL did some light research and chose Black Dog for dinner. \u00a0Another colleague who was local to the area told us that Urbana was \"dead\" and we should go somewhere else. \u00a0We ignored the advice and boy were we glad we did!It was a Monday about 6pm and we had roughly a 5 minute wait. \u00a0The guy who seated us was a little surly but we didn't have to interact with him much. \u00a0Our server however, was great fun. \u00a0We had the beer flight which was great and then each of us had a sandwich - 2 pulled pork and 2 burnt ends - and then the sweet potato fries. \u00a0Sandwiches came with sauce and coleslaw on the sandwich and they were phenomenal. \u00a0Price was amazingly low and terrific value for the dollar.", 
      "Best bbq in CU! Some portions are not extremely large, but everything tastes great. Prices are extremely reasonable. Plan for at least a 30 minute wait around dinner time.", 
      "Great food! Even the small number of veggie items are really good. Be adventurous with the sauces, they are all so good. The food comes out fast, so long lines move faster than you'd expect. Also take out is a very feasible option.Wish they could be a little bigger, maybe 4 additional tables...", 
      "I absolutely love the food specials and drinks, with daily specials and lots of homemade goodness, you'll definitely love this little bbq joint! The Pineapple or Raspberry/Pepper margaritas are so refreshing, peppery, and \u00a0boozy. If you want to try a variety of different bbq meats, get the combo meals, choice of two meats and two sides. \u00a0The local chicken is to die for, smokey and tender, in fact, I'd say it's the theme for \u00a0all the bbq'd meats there! Black Dog offers different house made sauces too...the peach is really good, sweet, and spicy! \u00a0You need to get there early for lunch/dinner; popular items can run out pretty quickly. \u00a0Great prices, portions, and always a line out the door, Black Dog is a must to check out.", 
      "Don't let the long line turn you off; it is totally worth the wait. Delicious BBQ, great beer selection, excellent service, and a fun, lively atmosphere. You can't go wrong.", 
      "I am not a HUGE fan of smoked foods. \u00a0Most of my experiences with smoked meats ended up leaving an \"ash-tray\" taste in the mouth, or really dry meat. \u00a0But at Black Dog, I LOVED IT. \u00a0My husband cleared his plate faster then I have ever seen - and said straight away that his food was the BEST smoked pulled pork he had ever had. \u00a0I had the beef brisket, and damn, it was good. \u00a0Can't beat the price tag, I mean, really? \u00a0If I remember correctly, our bill was less then $15!", 
      "Awesome food, awesome people", 
      "I had a full rack of ribs with slaw and sweet potato fries as my sides. The ribs were some of the best dry rub ribs I've had: very tender, smokey and meaty. I could not finish a full rack. The fries were on par with any other sweet potato fries I've had anywhere, but the portion size was relatively small and the fries themselves were on the cool side like they'd been cooked and reheated. The slaw was not to my liking. The cabbage was cut too thick, chewy and bitter. \u00a0And while the sauce was a pretty tasty vinegar base, it did nothing to transform the cabbage. The sauce just ran to the bottom of the bowl. I would definitely recommend this place if just for the ribs. Our party of 4 waited about an hour to get in, but the servers were attentive and good at handling large crowds. \u00a0I would have given Black Dog 5 stars if the slaw and fries were better. \u00a0Overall, I love the feel of the place and appreciate a small business that does things well.", 
      "This is by far the best place in town for barbecue... on top of that its got an excellent atmosphere. I generally stick to the pulled pork and cornbread - don't miss out. \u00a0They also have about 5 beer taps - and they are always hooked up to something good.The place is kind of small and it's always crowded around meal times, so plan on stopping in before you get hungry.", 
      "Best BBQ in town! \u00a0Black Dog is revitalizing downtown Urbana. \u00a0The food is great, the staff is great, and the draft line variety keep you coming back for more.No reservations, but well worth the wait!", 
      "Best place to eat in C-U, in my opinion. \u00a0Not too expensive, either, given the quality of the BBQ you're getting. \u00a0I haven't had anything that wasn't good there, so you really can't go wrong. \u00a0Beer selection is excellent as well, which is a nice bonus.That said, the quality is a little variable. \u00a0Some nights it's just good but then other nights it's drop dead amazing. \u00a0On top of that, it's impossible on virtually any night of the week so get there early (5:30 or so) or expect to wait a long time. \u00a0It's still worth it and you can't begrudge them their success, they deserve.Always ask if they still have burnt ends... and I vastly prefer their hot Georgia Peach sauce to the standard sauce.", 
      "I'm not a BBQ fan, but this was amazing! I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was fantastic. Definitely recommend this place.", 
      "I've told my friends about this place and I'm pretty sure they don't believe it exists. It is literally a hole in the wall. Fills my tummy with joy.Pulled Pork is the best. Great sweet potato fries. Not only the best BBQ in C-U, but maybe the Midwest.Cons: Always busy.", 
      "My girlfriend and I ad the opportunity to stop in the Black Dog on a Sunday afternoon and after a 15 minute wait, was seated at two seats near the back by a server stand. We ordered two of the sampler platters so got a good range of entree's and sides. The food was excellent, the chicken (white meat) was tender and the catfish was smoked through wonderfully. I was not a huge fan of the cornbread, but it was different and I would not hesitate to order it as an appetizer. I also had the beer sampler and there was a nice range of beer to compliment the food. Waitress was friendly and service was fast but we never felt rushed at all. I will definitely stop in next time i'm in town.", 
      "Two words to describe this joint: outstanding BBQ. \u00a0If you eat meat, this is a place you have to try. \u00a0Great ribs, great pork, great brisket. \u00a0The wait is always really long to get a table cause the food is fantastic, but the space is a bit small for the demand.", 
      "Awful service, great food.Those words basically sum up this place. Because of the food, black dogs is always packed. You don't want to eat in usually because the service is non-existent. They will give u the food and never come back. I actually had a waitress that was eating in the back, but we were done eating and wanted the check. After calling her up, she had to take another bite and casually take her time giving us dirty checks. It is unacceptable!After having a great meal, the terrible service just ruined it.So I should probably give 2 scores.Service: 0/5Food: 5/5I recommend take out only.", 
      "I went to Black Dog on a recent visit to C-U. \u00a0Based on the reviews here, I was expecting a long wait, but got lucky and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table (I'm sure the miserable weather had something to do with that). \u00a0I can be a touch critic when it comes to BBQ - having spent years living in the southeast and in Texas, I'm familiar with both BBQ traditions. \u00a0Since everything looked so good, I had to get a combination plate. \u00a0My ribs were just so-so - I got the small end, and the meat had gotten pretty dried out, and were perhaps a tad over-seasoned. \u00a0They did have a decent smoke flavor though, and I imagine that if I had gotten the larger pieces I would have liked them significantly better. \u00a0The brisket (my usual favorite) was not particularly good - it was so lean that it had become dry and tough. \u00a0However, the burnt ends really stole the show. \u00a0In case you aren't familiar, they are chunks of the brisket point (not really \"burnt\", but they spend some extra time in the smoker giving more smoke flavor, and they don't get overly dry because of their higher fat content). \u00a0They had great flavor, with an ideal, tender-but-not-too-tender texture. My sides were good - surprisingly good fries (skinny cut with a seasoned surface) and apples (a nice complement to BBQ that doubles as a dessert). \u00a0None of the sauces stood out to me, but it was nice that they had a variety. \u00a0If you want to try extra, you can get \"half-and-half\" if you ask - smaller portions of two different sauces - otherwise, they do charge extra. \u00a0It is a little on the pricey side for BBQ, but given the relative lack of quality options in C-U (and the fact that they're always so busy), I can't fault them for that too much.", 
      "I was a little unsure about trying black dog as the SO and I are very picky about bbq and generally prefer just to bbq at home. \u00a0We both absolutely loved black dog! \u00a0We had the burnt tips for an appetizer and I was very impressed with the flavor and the tenderness. \u00a0I ordered the brisket with their version of Texas bbq sauce and thoroughly enjoyed it. \u00a0Great smoke ring and flavor with a good portion size. \u00a0SO ordered the combo plate of a half slab of spareribs and catfish. \u00a0The ribs were seasoned well with a sweet dry rub which is how my SO prefers them. \u00a0They were cooked to perfection, tender but not overdone and I got a good crisp bite off the bone. \u00a0I didn't care for the catfish as it was smoked however the hubby enjoyed it. \u00a0I liked the bbq sauces we had (Texas and sweet Georgia peach) however did not \u00a0care for the house bbq sauce. \u00a0The side dishes are okay. \u00a0I had the Southwest potato salad and it was a different take on traditional potato salad. Atmosphere was great and the servers were friendly and knowledgeable. \u00a0I do wish they had more room inside the restaurant however I hear they're opening a second location with more square footage. \u00a0Definitely pleased and would have this add a go-to spot to take visitors for bbq.", 
      "If you like really dry, overcooked ribs and tips, come to this place. We came with a big group and it was already packed, so we decided to do carryout. It turned out to be 30 mins of waiting in a small cramped restaurant, with people constantly walking by forcing you to move, when our food finally came. There was also a guy walking out telling me, \"not worth the wait.\" I didn't think too much of it because the place looked promising. We went back to eat it and took about 10 mins figuring out who ordered what. They place all of our food together in 3 bags, which was fine, but they didn't labeled anything. We ordered the combo which included pulled pork, slab of ribs, and rib tips. I only tried the ribs and tips, but they were really dry and the sauce didn't make it any better. I have tried many great ribs, but this one definitely don't cut it. As busy as it gets here, the guy was right, definitely not worth the wait.", 
      "Honestly, if you've ever had real southern bbq or are from Chicago you will hate this restaurant. Its disgusting. The food is not good at all."

      "Looking at the other reviews, I am mildly ashamed of my rating choice, but most of this review/rating speaks on behalf of the tofu dishes. I love tofu that is somewhat dry and crispy. I would not have known such possibilities in tofu texture existed if it weren't for Chopstix (kidding, It could have been anywhere, but as far as I can recall it just so happened to be Chopstix). Unfortunately, I don't remember the first day I tried the tofu here, but before that I would have easily given Chopstix 2 or 3 stars, because their meat game is whack. After eating their tofu, I think that what they have lost in meat cred has been regained in tofu merit. I usually order the General Tso tofu combo with spring rolls (I think the spring rolls are good too) and have also tried the Szechaun, Orange, Sesame, and Kung Pao tofu. I prefer the General Tso, Sesame and Orange tofu because they often tend to contain the dryer, crispier tofu texture I adore. The meat dishes I've tried aren't that great (i've tried the sweet and sour, sesame, general tso, orange and kung pao chicken); compared to other restaurants in the area, it ceases to impress.Another thing it has going for itself is the fact that it stays open later than most; this gives the standard weekend drunkard no choice but to darken it's doorsteps (which honestly isn't that hard after a couple of drinks and if you like the dry, crispy tofu texture as I do).", 
      "Maybe I'm not being fair because I usually don't like Chinese food as a whole, but my take-out experience was sub-par at best. I came in late at around midnight and got Mongolian beef with egg-fried rice and an eggroll.It was definitely not worth $10 in terms of taste or portion size, I was really expecting better. There was also probably more onions then beef which was also annoying.I would say the only thing this place has going for it is the late night delivery and variety of options. Maybe I goofed and didn't order off the \"Our Most Popular Items\" list.I'm not sure, I'll be very reluctant to try it again, sorry!", 
      "If you are looking for good Chinese food, then look elsewhere. However, if it's 3 in the morning in CU and you need your fix of Sesame Chicken, \u00a0Lo-Mein, or Crab Rangoons then this place has your answer! Some of the other dishes load up on vegetables and give you very little protein considering the prices they charge, so make sure to check before ordering! Mediocre Chinese takeout for above average prices.", 
      "Please do not support this establishment. They are extremely rude. I ordered a large egg fried rice (delivery), recieved in an hour when they said 40mins, & when I got my food I couldn't eat it because it was very hard. My cousin ordered combo meals & they're food was gross & hard too. I called to make a complaint & a male & female worker went off on me. I've eaten here before so I know how the rice is supposed to be. They both told my cousin & I to never eat there again. I asked to speak with a manager & asked for my money back & she hung up on me. I've called 6 times & they both hung up on me.The lady also told me if I kept complaining she would call the cops on me. Wtf calls the cops on customers who don't like their food? They're a bunch of idiots.**** Do not eat here!!!!****", 
      "This is mediocre chinese takeout, which is really saying something. \u00a0It's also incredibly expensive. \u00a0My total for some shrimp lo mein and crab rangoon was ~$17 (with a tip, because you shouldn't take it out on the peons), and the food was really not very good.I'm sort of amazed there aren't better options in town.", 
      "A good place to go late night. Try their curry fired rice and won ton hou. It's very good. Can't commet on other dishes though.", 
      "Today, we ordered takeout from chopstix as we frequently have in the past, but this experience was so bad that I doubt we will return, and I encourage you to BE CAREFUL if you order from this restaurant. As we began eating, my friend took a bit of general tso's chicken with a STAPLE in it. After spitting out the staple and experiencing quite a bit of confusion we called chopstix to complain. They immediately denied that this was possible and told us that it must have been one of our staples (which had miraculously inserted itself into a piece of chicken in a sealed plastic container on the drive home). They demanded that we send a picture of the staple to their cellular phone number. \u00a0We did so immediately, within seconds of the requrest. \u00a0The owner got onto the phone and claimed that the staple could not possibly be one of theirs because it was \"curved\" differently. \u00a0My friend attempted to explain that this was impossible, but was screamed at by the owner and his wife. \u00a0The owner then told her that she would get \"IN TROUBLE\" if she reported this. \u00a0We are taking our chances and calling our local chapter of the Illinois Department of Public Health tomorrow morning.", 
      "Their shrimp lo-mein is the only \"alright\" dish. I tried the shrimp with broccoli once and it was garbage. A guy told me this was the best place ever. We aren't friends anymore.2 stars because both Lai Lai Wok and Cravings are better than this place in my opinion. And they are right the corner from chopstix.", 
      "so the good thing about chopstix is they deliver pretty much to anywhere till 3:00 in the morning (but they wont open till 4:00 afternoon so~ ) i wont call this place a cheap eat because their price is kinda high (above 10 bucks per entree) but the portion is big. However, the food tends to be on the bland side, and seem all have the same vegetables cooked in it (carrots, bamboo, water chestnuts, bell pepper --- all these cheap stuff) also, THE RICE BECOME ROCK HARD when it gets cold?!!!!!!1!!! those little bitches almost crack my teeth! (well, i ate too much sweets so my teeth are kinda in a bad condition and soft lol) anyway, their diced chicken is also very chewy and hard, (sliced one maybe better), oh oh and the texture of beef/pork is also not so good, its not tender nor juicy, just all kinda hard. Okay, on the plus side, they do made good craB rangoon (tho there is no actual CRAB in it, just cream cheese) but they are really big and fried till crispy. their curry flavored dishes are also worth a try. all in all, a okay place for college students to get late night Americanized Chinese food.", 
      "So far I have only invested in Chopstix's delivery service. As a vegan, I am content with the variety of tofu dishes offered, as well as the choice to either order a large entree or to go with a combo meal. Sometimes the deliverer of my goods has called me to inform me that the car is outside my dorm--this is after me not able to hear anything on the other side of the line--and the car is not, in fact, waiting there.I would personally advise against ordering the spicier dishes because my experience with those orders is over-filled with red pepper flakes instead of a variety of specs that add kick. Maybe I just don't order spicy Chinese food often enough to know better. Nevertheless, I have been very satisfied with my sesame tofu, regardless of the fact that it doesn't come with veggies in the combo platter, and I always have received more than one fortune cookie.", 
      "I love this place. \u00a0 They give you an excellent amount of food for the money, it tastes great, and they deliver! \u00a0Even late!", 
      "Chopstix.. definitely a drunk food classic, but soberly I would pass. The food is overpriced for the portions, takes a long time to get delivered, and tastes very sub-par. However, the crab rangoon are the best in Champaign. They're huge, meaty, and absolutely delicious - essentially the only reason why I would order from there anymore.", 
      "I'm seriously disappointed at the modest number of local places that will service the midnight appetites of college students. \u00a0And given the intense competition among Chinese restaurants in Champaign, I think it was a smart business tactic for Chopstix to exploit the late night market. \u00a0Chopstix delivers food until around 3:00 a.m. each night; the trade-off is that they don't open until 4:00 p.m.The actual storefront is just a counter with 3 tables (not really an invitation to stay and eat), but the service is friendly and enthusiastic.As for the menu, you'll find all those greasy Americanized-Chinese standards: lo mein, fried rice, and combo platters (entree, rice, and egg roll). \u00a0You'll need a gallon of water to offset the astronomical salt content of the food, but nobody eats at a place like this without expecting to do so.I ordered shrimp egg foo young, and the quality was above average. \u00a0The egg patties were an equal mix of meat and sliced vegetables (onions and nappa), with the edges crisp from frying. \u00a0I liked that the vegetables still had some substance and texture, and that the sauce wasn't a heavy, sluggish gravy. \u00a0Some bright green onions were even sprinkled on top to offer color to a usually drab plate of food.Overall, a welcome addition to the late night eateries in Champaign, especially as the food is really pretty decent.", 
      "The minute I walked in to Chopstix I knew it was different from the other 50,000 asian food restaurants on campus. \u00a0I have never in my life been treated with such customer service, and the owners never acted as though they were \"pretending\" to be nice in order to gain popularity.Every time I go in, I am treated like family, and Chopstix ALWAYS satisfies my chinese food cravings!!! Prices are extraordinarily cheap-- you can easily get two meals out of one order (their portions are huge!!) and not pay more than $8.I can't say enough great things about this restaurant- the owners really know what they are doing!!!", 
      "I was expecting to see a bunch of two-star reviews, so now I feel badly, but... I was hella thrilled for midnight Chinese with my sister after we got off work. \u00a0I was hella not thrilled that the wonton soup was straight up the most ridiculous soup ever. \u00a0The wontons were MASSIVE... which should be GOOD... except that they were nearly impossible to eat based on their size (not a big deal) and almost tasteless. \u00a0I mean, these wontons are massive, but had the same amount of meat as a wee-wonton. \u00a0The broth was nearly tasteless.We also shared the Szechuan pork which came in a huge portion, but really tasted like veggies and a little pork with teriyaki sauce. \u00a0Still, not expensive, huge portions, open late.", 
      "Coming from the northeast I've definitely lowered my standard for Chinese food, so I'll admit this isn't the best food around. \u00a0What I will say is that their service is amazing and since they are the only late night Chinese restaurant around (especially with delivery) when it's necessary they are tops!I've come to realize, it's acutally pretty decent food. \u00a0You can't go wrong with General Tso's or Orange Chicken. \u00a0My friend likes their fried dumplings and their Wonton Soup is good. \u00a0What you'll notice is every time you come in, regardless of it's your first or second time, they'll always greet you with a smile and take care of you. \u00a0There's a sweet girl who works in there, who I swear must be on pills because she is always happy and super nice to you. \u00a0It's mainly a take-out and delivery place, but you can eat there. \u00a0When you eat there, they'll serve you water and bring you napkins and such, but it's not really an eat-in place. \u00a0There's a 3% discount if you pay cash.Being on a college campus, we all get interesting cravings for interesting things throughout the night. \u00a0Chopstix is currently the only restaurant I know of that does both take-out and delivery until at least 3:00am. \u00a0By the way, delivery is relatively quick. \u00a0Just try it out, it's pretty good.", 
      "I spent 10 bucks (plus delivery and tip) for the Kung pao beef. I got maybe $2 worth of beef at most. It was literally 80 percent vegetables. Like are you kidding me? Did they not have beef left or what? The biggest waste of money When It comes to food in cu. Beef was OK. The vegetables (that made 80 percent of the meal) were honestly crap and distasteful. Please go online and order from Any of the other countless Chinese delivery places. They are ALL better.", 
      "When this place first opened up, I was confused because there are already like half a dozen Chinese restaurants on or around the U of I campus. So I wondered how they would be able to compete.Here's how. They deliver and they deliver late. If you want food at like 1 am, they'll bring it to you. I don't think any of the other ones do. And this place has cheap prices for pretty decent food. It's not like authentic authentic but it gets the job done. And it's still more Chinese than panda express. I always get the crab ragoons. I like how it's not traditional and they roll them differently. And the beef and broccoli is always a good choice. pay cash and they give you like a 30 cent discount too!", 
      "The food is nothing special. \u00a0Every entree has a very monotonous taste and the flavors are very dull. Majoirty of the 30+ Chinese restaurants around Green Street serve better tasting food, but a place that is willing to deliver at 3am deserves at least 3 stars.", 
      "Best place for fast Chinese food. I like the ho fun, mee go-reng and singapore noodles. They are open really late and deliver.", 
      "Full disclosure ahead of time: I worked here as a cashier for a few months (October 2012 to February 2013). As one of the only establishments open after 2 AM on campus, it caters to the last call crowd; having been on both sides of the table, literally, this in itself is quite the experience.As for the food, I would go to Cravings for more complicated dishes, but for staples like spicy chicken fried rice, orange/sesame/General Tso's chicken, Chopstix can't be beat.", 
      "I ordered Mongolian beef and I think I got Mongolian onions and beef as a garnish. I think there were a total of 5 pieces of meat in that dish. I admit the onions tasted pretty good, but almost 10 dollars for a pile of cooked onions is pretty ridiculous.", 
      "I ordered Kung pao chicken, it came with pieces of chicken chucked in celery and peppers. The chicken pieces were hard, almost raw, the dish was barely edible. I called them and let them know, he said he personally packed it and it was 'double cooked', and \"If I don't find the taste to my liking, sorry about that\" I requested a coupon for next time, nope! We don't do that! Yes thank you very much chopstix, just coz you are one of the few who deliver late at night (this was afternoon btw) you think you'll not care about your customers. Drag yourself to Cravings or Panda express (which is way off campus but amazing). Do not bother with this restaurant.", 
      "This place is anything but authentic, but it is the most addicting place to order food if you love Chinese American and you're a broke student. I seriously order when I'm 8 drinks in or stone cold sober. My friends have to claw my Blackberry out of my hands when I'm walking home from my weekend drunken escapade just to re-delete this saved contact. Too bad I know it by heart ;-) The only bad thing I can say about this place is that it opens at 4pm when I really would love to order it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If I could tell the management anything I'd say to please hire day people and just stay open 24-hours... it would seriously pay off if there are more crazy people like me. Overall, order here and you'll get yourself a perfect batch of fried rice (that may not actually be fried but it's totally delicious) and some General Tso's Chicken without the breading... YUM!", 
      "I was seeking a decent Chinese take out/delivery restaurant in town, so I saw that Chopstix was highly rated on Yelp. \u00a0However, what is not reflected in the high ratings is what the normal clientele are for the restaurant. \u00a0I am sure that Chopstix is great for college students who are seeking something late night to soak up all of the booze on a Friday night. \u00a0All I am looking for is decent Chinese take out. \u00a0And I found this food barely edible. \u00a0The General Tso's chicken was so dry as to be difficult to chew. \u00a0The good news is that the portions are very large. \u00a0So you get very large quantities of nearly inedible food.I definitely will not be back!", 
      "The food is good but the service is awful. I placed an order online and waited three hours without my order being delivered. I call after and hour and a half and was told my order was on its way to me. I wait another hour and nothing so i called again and was told that they tried several times to contact me, my phone never rang. They also told me they tried to call me right after I place my order to let me know they could not deliver it, why didn't they tell me when I called? I will never order from here again. So very disappointed.", 
      "My go to when I want late night Chinese. I usually get the lo mein or sesame chicken (or tofu) platter. For about $8-9 you get a decent portion of entree, fried or steamed rice, and a spring or egg roll. Their crab rangoons are folded more like a pocket, but are still good (little oniony, though). Delivery is fast and service is very good. Not the BEST Chinese food in town, but still good, especially when everything else is closed.", 
      "It took 40 minutes for the food to get here, and when it did, they forgot my spring roll. Because of my hunger, I was willing to let that pass. Sadly, the food wasn't much better. In layman terms, the food was crappy. The fried rice tasted like rice mixed with some salt and a lot of pepper. The beef and broccoli tasted like fake beef and nasty broccoli covered in soy sauce. I am very disappointed. Never again. I'm sure there are many better alternatives to late night Chinese food.", 
      "I've gotten takeout from this place twice now (szechuan chicken dinner combo and I must say I have been impressed. Not your typical greasy joint (although it has the same menu as one), the food was cooked to order with good quality chicken and veggies that still had a decent bit of crunch. You can sub the egg roll for wonton soup for 85 cents, so I did. It was yummy and definitely hit the spot The only downside is that the dinner combos are just under 8 bucks, which is a bit high... but considering the quality I think this will move up in the 'it's late and I don't have any food at home' rotation.", 
      "I am a fan of Chopstix delivery service! Chopstix is a new Chinese restaurant on Green and 2nd. \u00a0My roommate has been ordering food there a couple of times and encouraged me to try it. The menu is like any other chinese restaurant: soup, appetizer, poultry, fried rice, etc. The girl who picked up the phone was very nice. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken entree which included a side of whtie rice and was priced $9.05. A lot of the entrees are p riced between $8-9 which isn't too bad. It's on the border of pricey, however, I don't mind paying this much from Chopstix. They have a combo platter which I wouldn't recommend ordering. The combo platter is priced between $7-$7.50 and is a smaller portion than the entree. It is served with steamed white rice or fried rice with a choice of either egg roll or spring roll. The portion is too small and they don't give you enough meat in the combo platter. In addition, the egg roll isn't that great. However, my General Tso Chicken entree came in a timely manner. It was hot and fresh. The delivery guy was very polite and I gave him a $2 tip. On the side note, I just found out that they will charge a $1.50 delivery fee if your order is $15.00... oh well. I'm excited that they're open till 3AM which I need to take advantage of in the future. Anyways, I would recommend ordering at Chopstix again. Thank you, roomie for this awesome recommendation.", 
      "I miss you, Chopstix. \u00a0Since I moved across the country in July, I think about your General Tso's tofu on a weekly basis, at least. \u00a0Maybe one day, I will return and smuggle some onto the plane back. \u00a0Much love.", 
      "Try Ho Fun or Low Mein! They are so good! You can ask them to make your food spicy in level 1-5. Level 1 is perfect, not too spicy but adds up more taste to the food. Chopstix is perfect for dinner or late night if you do not feel like going out or low on budget. At least all the food that I've ordered has been good.", 
      "Pretty good. I would not recommend ordering too late, or the food has a chance of not being so great. Otherwise, I enjoy the food from here.", 
      "Does what its supposed to! \u00a0Fast delivery, freshly cooked. \u00a0They have plastic, not cardboard containers.I got the Szechuan chicken, and the chicken was surprisingly tender, and the vegetables actually had some crunch. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0Plus the place is open till three which makes it so convenient for late night eating, especially if you're craving it.5/5 because it does what it's supposed to. \u00a0It may not be the BEST Chinese out there, but it does what its supposed to well", 
      "Yes there are a million Chinese take out places in Champaign-Urbana. \u00a0However this is one of the better ones. \u00a0When I am at work, late nights, they deliver and when you call there is always someone nice and helpful to help you. \u00a0Their prices are reasonable and the delivery people are very personable. \u00a0I generally order the Chicken Broccoli combination which comes with steamed or fried rice and an egg roll. \u00a0Their egg rolls are chicken and always nice and crispy. \u00a0I am a big fan of this place and have recomended it to my coworkers!", 
      "Best orange chicken on campus. Pretty quick delivery and open late.", 
      "Good food, but higher on the $ for what you get.I love how they deliver late, this has saved me many times when I'm pulling allnighters.I usually order the orange chicken because they pack the box you get it in. It's good for a 3-4 meals.Just don't save their rice after you eat. Unless you like eating hard dry rice.Delivery time: usually 40-60 minutes", 
      "I was very excited when I saw that a new Chinese place was open and that it is open really late! \u00a0Then once I saw their menu and saw that they have a tofu general tso's I had to try it. So I did and it wasn't all that great. \u00a0I am not sure how other general tso's are, but this one didn't have any broccoli at the bottom like other ones that I've had and the tofu was ehhh. \u00a0Some pieces had a really good crisp to them, and others were tough and chewy. The food is reasonably priced and you get a ton, but stay away from the tofu general tso's unless you really really like tough and chewy tofu and rice. \u00a0I know I will next time.Oh, but one thing they do get points for is if you pay with cash you get a 3% discount, even on delivery.", 
      "I was very disappointed with my entr\u00e9e purchase. Most of it was vegetables and hardly was actually the beef that I ordered.", 
      "called in for pick up. decently fast. friendly service (college students, seemed like). A LOT OF FOOD. for pretty cheap. good value. not amazing food, but you wouldn't go here for quality dine-in experience anyway.the only negative was that it's hard to find parking on Green St (legally). I temporarily parked in the residence parking behind the restaurant since I was just picking things up... but they deliver, so I guess that's an option. Def my new go-to for Chinese latenight cravings. :)"

      "I've never eaten at the Green Street location. I can say that the location at The Crossing (Windsor and Duncan) is the best pizza in town. Here's why:1. The sausage is stellar. I don't even get sausage pizza all the time. I get it nearly every time I order from Papa Del's it's so good.2. The crust. I always get the thin crust. It's not cracker thin. It is still crispy though and has never been soggy.3. The sauce. It's not the best I've ever had but It's the best in town. I always get extra sauce and the amount is just right.That's it. It's easily the best in town and my first choice when ordering or picking up pizza.", 
      "It's nice to know that there is a good deep dish place this far away from Chicago. To be honest with you, I prefer thinner pizza, but my roommates insisted on trying Papa Del's one boring Sunday evening. We ordered a cheese and sausage which was delivered in about an hour.The dough is the correct consistency and there was not too much nor too little of it, which is usually an issue at many not-as-well-known deep-dish pizzerias. The cheese tasted great, and there was not 16 tons of it piled on, which can sometimes ruin the pie. Also of good quantity (and quality) was the sauce. It was flavorful and the pizza was not swimming in it, which is all too frequent a problem in the world of crappy deep-dish.The sausage itself was pretty tasty. I'm not sure if it was fresh or not, we probably should have asked. Back home, fresh toppings are deciding factors for my family, since we can be pizza Nazis. Either way, I just wish there was more of it on the pizza. There was probably only 1-2 little balls per slice, which in my opinion could have been more plentiful.I will definitely order Papa Del's again and recommend it to anyone who enjoys deep dish.", 
      "Dining-in: it's crowded, loud, and the service is awful. I get that the pizzas take a while, but that doesn't mean that everything else should, too. I've never had a polite interaction with the staff here (nothing outrageous, but for a Champaign \"staple\", one might think that the staff would be a little more gung-ho about being such an attraction to visitors... yes, you, I saw your roll your eyes at me when I changed my order mid sentence. Rude!).Ordering-in: A good experience because I can avoid the cramped seating and the impolite staff. Deep dish holds well as a reheat option the next day. Their sausage pizza is really delicious.One plus: I have friends in Chicagoland who love this pizza and if we're in Champaign for a visit, we bring back Papa Dels. It travels well.Overall: If you're in Champaign, yes, it's the best deep dish there is. If you're from anywhere else, you can do better.", 
      "I grew up here and have been coming to Papa Dels since 1976. It sure has gotten mediocre.Went here today for lunch and first off the restaurant needs an update (this building dates from the 1990s if memory serves when the original location on 6th St. closed). It's ratty looking with a huge stain on the ceiling where the wallpaper has peeled off. Fix it. How hard can that be?The dough for the pizza (we ordered slices) has always been on the bready side, but I used to like that since it was moist and flavorful. This was dry as dust, lacking in sauce and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp forever. Blech.And seriously. It's not 1976 anymore. A salad can contain something other than iceberg lettuce. It's even available here in the midwest now, if the local grocery stores are any indication. Use it.My nephew ordered breadsticks that were just gross. Huge batons of bread (the pizza dough?) with a nuclear cheese or marinara sauce. They were completely unflavored. No cheese, garlic, butter or anything. Just batons of dry bread. Again, gross.Sad that an old institution has gone so far downhill.", 
      "Simply the best deep dish, and has been since I had my first slice over 22 years ago. \u00a0 Worth the 2 hour drive. \u00a0 Go for the sausage and go extra sausage if you must", 
      "Papa Dells pizza pales in comparison to real deep dish pizza. The crust is very thick and not flavorful. The sausage and pepperoni toppings aren't anything special. I do enjoy the amount of cheese they put on their pizza. If you want the Chicago pizza experience don't waste your time here or money.", 
      "I'll NEVER go to either of the Papa Del establishments again. \u00a0After paying $50 for two pizzas that I waited almost 1.5hrs to have delivered, I received subpar products (overcooked and poorly made). \u00a0To make things worse, when I called to give feedback and ask for some kind of accommodation, I was talked down to by one shift manager Rob and hung up on by another Mark. \u00a0After 20 yrs. of patronage, I expected better. \u00a0They have lost my business forever and I'll be sure to let the owner Bob know exactly why!", 
      "The pizza was great, just make sure you get it and run. \u00a0The seating at the Windsor Rd. site consists of patio tables and plastic patio chairs haphazardly arranged in a small waiting area. \u00a0Not an ideal way to enjoy great pizza. \u00a0The paper plates and plastic cutlery they provided, however, was a classy touch.", 
      "Best pizza place in town. You will wait, but it's well worth the wait.", 
      "In the fast food world of college campus towns, every place should have a traditional place that stands the test of time. That's Papa Del's. Quality pizza & sandwiches with great flavor, huge portions & reasonable prices keep you coming back. Service is slow and the building's architect should have been fired @ the first drawings review, but it's all about the food here & it is good.", 
      "I really don't like deep dish pizza, but I LOVE the deep dish at Papa Del's!! It's so good and so worth the wait to get it. Unfortunately we didn't discover it until my senior year while at UIUC. I miss it so much. If you live in the area you need to go try it.", 
      "Bad pizza, average service, not a place that I would visit again.I order the so-called \"Stuffed Pizza\". In Chicago, stuffed pizza usually has a lot of cheese with only a little bit of crust. This pizza was totally the opposite, with hardly any cheese and a crust as thick as a loaf of bread. The crust also had a bread texture with no flavor whatsoever. I noticed a number of tables around leaving nearly half of their crust before they moved onto the next slice. When you have to leave that much crust behind, something is wrong Also, there was hardly any sauce on the pizza, and the sauce was burnt as well. Another thing they did was add A LOT of oregano on top. If it was a good pizza, it should be able to stand alone without any help. The addition of this oregano makes me wonder if the restaurant isn't confident in their pizza. While I kindly asked for the rest of my pizza to be put in a to-go bad, I threw it away in a garbage can near my car, as I knew I would never finish it at home.I also ordered garlic bread with cheese. The bread was hardly toasted, and the cheese peeled right off. Again, very disappointing.I was thinking that this would be a good alternative to Chicago-style stuffed pizza. But what I had tonight was anything but Chicago-style. Basically a loaf of bread with mediocre sausage and burnt sauce.", 
      "Delicious pizza but awful service. The pizza is delicious and it never disappoints. Tons of cheese and a lot of crust, so this is not definitely for people counting calories. Every time I go to the restaurant the wait is very long, sometimes even over an hour. The staff doesn't seem very attentive either, and they charge $1 for a take-out box. My advice: either get delivery/take-out or go somewhere else.", 
      "I went there before an Illini b-ball game. It's crazy busy on game day, so get there early and put your pizza order in while you wait for a table if you want to save some time. The thick crust takes about 40 minutes to bake and if there's a line already, expect your order to take about an hour and quarter. So, it's nice to place the order ahead of time, grab some drinks at the bar, and then get seated with about 20 minutes left to wait for your pizza. Staff is super friendly.Now for the food... the other reviews don't lie. It's delicious. I like Chicago deep dish and this is some of the best I've ever had. The dough is fantastic and the cheese is melted perfectly. They have a great selection of toppings to build your own pie and it's not too pricy.", 
      "I could almost eat this pizza everyday. I have yet to have a bad pizza here! It's your typical pizza joint, College aged servers and wooded chairs and tables. Can be loud but you will forget all that when you try the pizza! Now, I want pizza ;)", 
      "BEST PIZZA IN TOWNLegendary in every sense of the word. If you are an upstate, chicago person you will probably turn your nose up to their deep dish saying \"it isn't authentic, real chicago deep dish\". But as far as I'm concerned, it is the best deep dish south of I-80.It isn't lou malnati's or giordano's but thats okay. Its delicious, high quality, awesome pizza. Famous for this sausage, but I still prefer their pepperoni. The deep dish will take ~40 mins to cook. So I always call ahead regardless of if I'm carrying out or eating in to make sure the pizza is ready when I get there. You haven't had the U of I experience until you've been to Papa Del's!", 
      "Read the reviews, so I decided to order an Original Sicilian Pizza. Even though the manager messed up the order, he did start another pizza fresh from scratch and gave me half off.I tried the pizza and it was really good.My first taste of a Deep Dish Pizza.I usually just order thin crust, but was tempted to try something new.The sauce tastes fresh, the crust was well-cooked, and the mozzarella was fresh.This is actually a good place.You should try it out!A+", 
      "Great Pizza! I was in Champaign for business and this place was recommended to me. It is well worth the money for amazing deep dish pizza!", 
      "Can't get enough of this pizza. The restaurant boast several seating areas that accommodate the usual large crowds. Personally, carry out is the best option so you don't have to wait 45 minutes for your deep dish pizza to bake. The Sicilian style pizza will continue to be a tradition on the University of Illinois campus.", 
      "Papa Del's has been one of my favorite dining establishments in Champaign (and THE best pizza) since I first tried it as a college freshman 34 years ago.Del's is most well known and well loved for its pan (thick) pizza. Though it is thick and cooked in a pan, I don't really consider this to be a Chicago deep dish pie, but I consider Del's pan pizza to be a style of its own. Though the pan pizza is good, I feel it is overrated by most patrons as it has a disproportionately high ratio of dough to toppings.My preference therefore is Del's thin, which I think is the unsung hero of the Papa Del's menu. Their thin pizza has a crust roughly 1/4 inch thick, which comes out from the oven crispy on the bottom and softened by the ingredients on top. To me, the thin pizza's proportion of dough to sauce, cheese, and other toppings is just about perfect.Normal cooking time for a thin is 30 minutes and for a thick (pan) is 45 minutes. Adjust \u00a0these numbers upward if you are dining at a busy time, particularly on Illini home football game weekends.Del's serves excellent garlic bread which will tide you over between the time you sit down and the time your pizza is served. Service and the overall dining experience at Papa Del's can be spotty at times. The main dining room is a building whose tall ceilings and walls turns it into a bit of an echo chamber; the space would be improved by wall treatment that would deaden the sound. Groups of patrons are sometimes doubled up at the long tables with other groups of patrons, even when there's plenty of vacant dining space available, and the college-aged wait staff can be hard to flag down at times, though at other times they are attentive and responsive.For those reasons I order for pick-up (Papa Del's also offers delivery) more often than not. In any event, my fondness for Papa Del's is not about the service and dining experience; it's all about the pizza.", 
      "Amazing if the \"inner fat kid\" needs nourishment! \u00a0So good but call and prep ahead if you are wanting 2 feed a crowd. These pizzas are a masterpiece and that takes time, but the wait is good for a delicious slice that weighs the amount of a new born!", 
      "Damn, just... damn...Great, great deep dish pizza. Comparable to Chicago pizzas (well, maybe better because is cheaper).The waiting is long, but give them a credit cause its said on the menu (45min minimum waiting). Well, if you go with friends, just order some pitcher and wait for it having a nice conversation.I've been here twice, and just loved.. the price is a bit out of the average cirty range, but its worth it.I would add that the price difference between the Original Sicilian Pan and the Suer Stuffed Pizza is not worth it. The super stuffed only comes with and extra layer of crust above the pizza. You get more by ordering a original sicilian with more toppings.", 
      "Hands down the BEST pizzeria in the Champaign-Urbana area. They are the only place around that serves authentic Chicago deep-dish pizza, though not exclusively; they also do excellent traditional thin crust pizzas as well as sandwiches and other appetizers. The campus location offers dine-in, delivery, or carry out. Be warned that the dine-in option is limited by space. All the tables are essentially crammed into a corner, which not only makes for a sometimes spatially uncomfortable seating arrangement, but also for a very unamusing game of who can shout the loudest to overcome the raucous echoes from other tables. Whether you dine in or out of the restaurant, expect a longer wait that usual. This isn't the usual pizza, so naturally it requires more than the usual time to prepare. Regardless, Papa Del's is worth experiencing - don't leave Champaign without doing so!", 
      "Exquisite fare. No wonder why this school churns out the best engineers.", 
      "My brothers and I showed up in town for a Big 10 tournament from Chicago - so we relied on yelp to help us find a decent pizza restaurant in the area. \u00a0Papa Del's listed great reviews for deep dish pizza - but we had just had our favorite in Chicago the night before so were actually looking for hand tossed or thin.Thanks to yelp, we ended up here.We called ahead for carry out rather than trying to figure out if they could deliver to our hotel. \u00a0The pizza was perfect and the italian salad was too big to finish. \u00a0The sausage on the pizza we ordered were like mini meatballs - almost too big for one bite.Everyone who works there is obviously a college student but very nice and helpful. \u00a0The restaurant has a weird layout and was typical dirty bar/college with crumbs, straw wrappers, napkins on the floor...so get your food to go if this would bother you.", 
      "I ate this pizza for ten straight hours, and when I was done, I applauded. It was far, far better than the best pizza I could possibly imagine, and it has restored my faith in God.", 
      "I am not going to lie. I was so nervous trying this place for myriad reasons.I am from the Western Suburbs. I love Stuffed Pizza. First, let me remind you there is a difference between stuffed, deep dish, pan, double dough, thin, and extra thin. Examples: Papa Del's=Stuffed (stuffed crust, cheese, EXTRA THIN LAYER OF DOUGH, Sauce). Nancy's, Giordano's, and my local favorite growing up, Gianorio's of Winfield excel in making this type of pizza. Deep Dish=Lou Malnati's/Gino's East (crust, cheese, sauce)Pan= Connie's (THICKer.....crust, sauce, cheese) I want to say Papa Del's Sicilian is very similar to this, but it is their specialty that I have not tried as of yet, but I will soon!Double Dough= Self explanatory. Usually closed to hand tossed.Thin= Average local joints mix between this double dough. Think Home Run Inn, Domino's standard, Papa John's. Pub crust is often used here as well.Cracker thin=specialty, like Vito and Nick's Anyway, now that we have that all settled, Papa Del's still gave me pause before ordering...especially when I ordered, the clerk didn't seem too happy to know that I had 20 coupons (10 dolla off any L/XL pizza). One of my best friends' sisters actually had a run in at this location with a waitress which is the reason why I had waited so long to try this place! Again, why let some snobby undergrad waitress ruin the nostalagia that is crust, cheese, sauce, and love?Decided on the Super Stuffed Cheese. 21.64 our total, which was before the coupon. We'd have to wait an hour and since I live 25 minutes from here, it worked out well.The stuffed pizza was AMAZING! The clerk was actually very nice, the total ended up being under $11 with the coupons, and I had a \"pizza warmer\" in my car for the long drive! SCORE! I thought the crust would be dry, but it was full of flavor! The cheese is the highlight of this pizza for sure! The seasoning in the sauce really wasn't there, but what do you expect in a college town pizza joint? Well, have high expectations for this place!Some of the best pizza I have ever had! I would put it in my top 10 pizza experiences of my life! Even though the drive through the rain sucked on I 57, I know I will be back!I was so worried it would not be up to my high standard, but I can't wait to have it again...plus even try the Sicilian! GO TO PAPA DEL'S IF YOU ARE in Champaign!", 
      "On a recent visit to Champaign, my bro and I decided to get some Papa Del's to bring back to his place in Paxton for dinner... and boy were we in for a treat!Being from Chicago, REAL pizza is either Deep Dish or Stuffed. Don't give me that thin garbage (thin is good, but its not za). I want to eat my pizza with a fork and knife, and Papa Del's Super Stuffed fit the bill!Note: Please don't get me started on people who don't know the difference between Deep Dish/Pan vs. Stuffed. If you have a question, just ask, because I will thoroughly explain it to you.Our order took about an hour, which is fine, because you can't rush perfection. Our total was very cheap too, because my bro acquired 20 coupons for a special deal.I'll be honest, I was a bit skeptical because this is Champaign.... a very far cry from Chicago. Once you are south of 80... be very wary of Pizza! now to the good stuff: the super Stuffed. It was fantastic! The crust looked sort of dry on the initial viewing, but on tastinhg, it was awesome. It has a nice chew, but was not chewy or crunchy. As for the cheese, the pizza had plenty, which was awesome as well. The sauce was very good too; it wasn't amazing, but it was seasoned nicely and did not just get dumped from a can (unless I'm totally !off, which I doubt). I actually wish there was more sauce, but oh well.I was pleasantly surprised at how good papa Del's was. IT made me feel like I was still eating Za from Chicago, which is a very good thing.Will I be back? You can count on it. The onlydecision I have to make: Their Deep Dish, or the SuperStuffed with Spinach (Only got cheese on this previous trip)? either way, I'm looking forward to it", 
      "Deep dish is pretty good. It reminds me of a Chicago deep dish type experience. I do like the thin crust as well. The place is always busy and noisy but worth the effort for the pizza.", 
      "Horrible. \u00a0Absolutely horrible.I stopped in for lunch. \u00a0I had an hour. \u00a0The garlic cheese bread was good, but didn't need to take forty five minutes to arrive, and my two slices pizza? forget it? \u00a0And I'd have chalked it up to the pizza taking time, but then why did the two tables that came in after us and ordered similar slices GET SERVED FIRST!? \u00a0Hell no.The service was...meh. \u00a0They were friendly but clueless and were completely flustered when I said, \"I'm late, I have to leave now.\"Worker: \"But your pizza is ready now!\"Teej: \"Way late, but I'll take it to go.\"Worker: \"Uh, wait, I'm gonna need a minute to change it up.\"Sweet Odin's Beard, woman! \u00a0Put it in foil and a bag. \u00a0It ain't that hard. \u00a0UGH.You suck Papa Del's. \u00a0And you know what else, I found the pizza to be...okay. \u00a0I'm not from Chicago, I know, but I do like deep dish, and I found it to be only okay. \u00a0Perhaps that's because I was rushing now to class late thanks to you, Papa Del's. \u00a0You suck and I hate you.", 
      "I really don't get what all the fuss is about. \u00a0The pizza is just okay...a little dry and bland.", 
      "Alright. I'm a Chicago boy. I have a deep dish pizza beating in the center of my chest. Don't get me going about what is mistaken for pizza in other parts of the country.That said...this place is great.My daughter introduced us to this place after a late night trip down to Urbana. Wow. It was better than expected.Food: Excellent pizza. We had deep dish and it was high quality, flavorful and abundant. Cost was very reasonable.Service: It was just before closing time and the young fellow taking care of us was attentive, personable and overall just great.Atmosphere: This place screams college town pizza joint. That should be all you need to know. It reminds me of an old pizza joint that was located on Taylor street in Chicago's little Italy. The place is closed now and there is a high end restaurant (Tuscany) running there now. It was dark, lots of wood and smelled of beer.Overall: It's a winner. Bring the family or order out. Great Pizza.", 
      "I went with a large group of friends on Halloween weekend. Pretty much everyone except for me and Husband went to the U of I. The out-of-towners in for Halloween insisted there was only one true C-U place for lunch: Papa Del's! They lauded the deep-dish-by-the-slice. I was warned it would be crowded, but I'm willing to walk into the fires of Mt. Doom for some good pizza.My experience: Meh.So, I think that people really love Papa Del's because that's where they went in college. It brings back fond memories of late nights or drinking or whatever. I get that. I am very nostalgic for certain college hangouts of my own. However. Papa Del's pizza SUCKED.I might be a bit unfair in my review. It might be amazing if you get a fresh pie made. It could be incredible. But the slices we got at 1:30 pm (after 20 minutes wait)? SUCKED.They were hardly warm, yet still had dark-brown spots from spending too long waiting to be served. Husband had a sandwich, which he said was decent, but everyone had talked up this pizza. Said it was better than Vinny's, better than Rosati's, etc. WHAT. It wasn't inedible, but I was far from impressed.Service wasn't outright rude, but also wasn't fantastic. I get it, it's lunch rush on a Saturday. You're used to getting treated poorly by college kids. Still, I expect a certain level of positive attitude from waitstaff. I certainly don't want to be treated like I'm a burden upon you because I chose to eat at your restaurant.In my opinion, if you aren't a current UIUC student, or someone going for nostalgia, there are better pizza places on campus.", 
      "Given the generally positive reviews this place receives, I was very much looking forward to trying their Chicago style deep dish. \u00a0However, I never got the chance because the service was so AWFUL!My wife and I arrived on a Saturday night at around 8pm, so, granted, it was a little busy. \u00a0We told the hostess that we were looking for a table for two and, after lazily glancing around at about three tables, she told us there was nothing available and then just walked away! huh? Thankfully, a waiter came over shortly after and found us an open table in about 10 seconds. \u00a0If only securing a table guaranteed actually being served food.We were seated at a table pushed up against a wall and behind another family (I won't dwell on the fact that the decor is atrocious and reminiscent of a high school cafeteria - with decibel levels to match). \u00a0Well, perhaps because we were hidden behind another family or perhaps because of the staff's general inattentiveness, we were never waited on...nobody even came by to take a drink order. \u00a0I understand from the reviews that the wait here can be long, so I was willing to give them some slack. \u00a0However, waiting 20-25 minutes simply for someone to acknowledge your existence is absurd. \u00a0We really had enough when we started seeing people who had come in after us get waited on as soon as they sat down. \u00a0At that point we simply got up and left. \u00a0Perhaps the pizza here is really good. \u00a0I can't say for sure. \u00a0But if I decide to try it again, it will definitely be for take out.", 
      "All I have to say is: WOW.Their pizza is sooooooooooo good.For sure ranks up there as one of the best stuffed pizzas EVER. This place was a sheer Godsend in a town utterly devoid of quality food!! I was drowning miserably in the midst of constantly-disgusting and disappointing meals. I am sorry Champaign, but you have basically no good restaurants. All of the remaining eateries are either Asian restaurants and/or restaurants with chefs who don't know how to cook.So thaaaank you Papa Del's for your scrumptious fare! Loved the super fresh veggie toppings and hefty (MASSIVE) pizza sizes.Hope to be back soon!", 
      "Although I am hopeful every time I see a Chicago pizza place, I am usually skeptical. This place looked perfect for what we were looking for... natural light, TV's, laid back, etc. We ordered breadsticks not knowing they are like 2 ft long! They were good but we couldn't make much of a dent.The stuffed pizza was a small but it was almost as tall as it was wide. It looked good and we struggled to figure out a way to conquer it. Unfortunately, the dough didn't do it. It was the same dough that was used for the breadsticks but it felt like I was eating pizza on a giant piece of Wonder Bread! My crust needs a little more personality and pizzazz and without a solid crust, the pizza isn't worth much!", 
      "Here's a secret: I will do anything for this pizza. Since every single person in Illinois seems to be some sort of self-crowned pizza expert, I'll tell you upfront: I'm not. I'm just a regular person who eats food. Sometimes I eat that food in Chicago. Most times I eat it in Portland. But in my 28 years of eating food, I've never eaten pizza that I like better than Papa Del's. The last time I was visiting, I even stuffed a frozen pizza into my checked luggage to take back to Portland, where I threw it in the oven a mere 90 minutes after my plane landed. What I mean to say is: this is special, special pizza.I'm seeing a lot of complaints about service, but that's missing the point. Does one complain about climbing a mountain to obtain wisdom from the guru at the top? (Actually, I probably would.) Yes, the service is miserable, but that's just part of the journey! There are two seating options to choose from while you wait (and wait, and wait): a sterile, cavernous dining room, or the small bar area, where the jukebox will inevitably be blaring an entire Journey album. Oh, neither of those suits you? Sheesh, why not ask Jesus to tidy up his manger while you're at it? The service has never improved at all during the 10 years I've been eating here, so it's futile to even spend time wishing it would; it's just what you have to deal with if you want the pizza.There is this part of the crust where the cheese sort of gets stuffed inside, and it's all gooey and amazing and occasionally I think about it when I'm supposed to be thinking of something else. I start eating each piece with a fork, but about 2/3 of the way up, I always just give in and eat it with my hands so I can best enjoy those precious bites that meld with the crust. The breadsticks are like giant loaves of bread, and you can get them with the pizza sauce or with this nacho cheese that I would normally reject outright, but for some reason it's amazing here. And really, I can only eat two slices, but sometimes I dare myself to go for three, and damn it if it isn't worth the stomach ache every time. What was it I said before? Oh, yes: this is special, special pizza.", 
      "I'm sorry everyone. \u00a0Maybe it's not fair that I review this as I love thin crust pizza so much. \u00a0Maybe it's also not fair that I was served after the pizza was delivered, and then I waited in line for several minutes. \u00a0Maybe it was the ridiculous hype that everyone brought with it that was its downfall. \u00a0With those things in mind: one of the worst... pizzas... ever.I took a quick picture on my phone (see: yelp.com/biz_photos/u8C8\u2026) and sent it to a friend. \u00a0He wrote back calling it bread lasagna. \u00a0Maybe it wasn't very good because it had been sitting out for 5 or 10 minutes after being delivered. \u00a0It had almost no flavor though. \u00a0And it was ALL bread. \u00a0I've had deep-dish before that was much better.I would be willing to try it again, fresh, at the restaurant; if I didn't live 1000 miles away.", 
      "I really wanted to give this place a better rating! \u00a0I've heard amazing things about it, so maybe that raised my expectations.I went with a few friends and they called in our deep-dish half cheese, half green pepper and mushroom pizza about an hour ahead of time and it wasn't even ready when we got there. \u00a0The waitress kept forgetting about us, it seemed, and the place was packed and not well-staffed enough for the amount of people here.Well, you guys know how I feel about customer service, so that would bring it down at least 1.5, if not 2, stars.The thing is, their pizza was awful! \u00a0There was too much dough and not enough cheese; the sauce was a bit under-spiced in my opinion, and the vegetables on my half of the pizza were sparse and didn't taste fresh. \u00a0I came in starving and didn't even eat a whole piece of pizza.I do remember, however, coming here years ago and really enjoying the thin crust pizza. \u00a0I saw some other people with it and it looked and smelled a lot better than mine, too, leading to my decision to give Papa Del's two stars instead of one.Also, the bathrooms were clean.That's about all I have to say.", 
      "When I fall in love, I fall hard. \u00a0Imagine, a scared college freshman away from home for the first time. \u00a0Ready for new experiences...ready for deep dish pizza, oh yes.I can remember my first pizza at Papa Del's as clearly as last night's. \u00a0(Well maybe last night's is a little clearer because the leftovers are in my fridge.) \u00a0You can go home again if home is for the best deep dish pizza this Illini fan has ever had.This is our eighth year of being the proud parents of U of I students and boy are we glad they weren't in college at the same time. \u00a0Not to avoid double tuition payments but to stretch out those Papa Del's pizzas.When we come here after football games, we know it will be a huge wait. \u00a0Before Basketball games is much easier. \u00a0Last night I actually had allotted 2 hours and we were completely done in a little over an hour and had surprisingly good service. \u00a0(It's a campus pizza place, 'nuff said for service expectations.)While you wait for your pizza you can talk to your family! \u00a0Have an Italian salad and then some cheesy garlic bread. \u00a0Then be prepared to fall in love and have an emotional affair with pizza that will last a lifetime."

      "Two inch verticalTwo pounds of waist-line per slicePure deep dish delight(First, I must make an odd observation about Del's. \u00a0I've NEVER, EVER, EVER been to a pizza shoppe that DIDN'T have 'suggested' pizzas on their menu! \u00a0No \"Hawaiian\", \"Supreme\", or \"Carnivore Lovers\" pizzas here... if you don't bring your own inspiration, then you're SOL at Del's! \u00a0The waiter gave me a funny look when I mentioned this, as if he'd never noticed this before. \u00a0Strange...But back to the food... \u00a0This place makes pretty solid deep-dish pizza. \u00a0As with most deep-dish, it takes a while for it to come out, so plan your dinner time accordingly. \u00a0We ordered a large pizza, and each slice was practically a meal in itself. \u00a0It also reheated nicely the next day, which was a nice bonus. \u00a0The pizza WAS moderately expensive, but worth it.Note: \u00a0I wasn't as impressed with their cheese-bread appetizer as I was with their pizza. \u00a0I wouldn't recommend it.One other POSITIVE noteworthy addition: \u00a0I needed to break a $20 to get change for the parking meter. \u00a0The server didn't have the exact change on him, so he just smiled, gave me 4 quarters, and said \"Don't worry about it.\" \u00a0I don't see this kind of generosity very much. \u00a0It's only a buck, but it made my day. \u00a0Needless to say, he received a handsome tip from me!)", 
      "this is the best THICK pizza I have ever had since the first time I came here in 1972 when we dropped off my older sister as a starting freshman at U of I.It is very different from Chicago Deep Dish pizza...this is SicilianI dream of this pizza and if I lived any closer I would be dead from eating it way too much.I see some of the other reviews were whining about it taking so long to cook....oh my, it is amazing how some people need their food fast and do not respect the time it takes to make something of true quality.I go simple here, sausage and garlic....but any pie here is awesome in my humble opinion.", 
      "You know Papa Del's must be good when the owner of \u00a0the place can be so, so rude to customers and they keep on coming back for more. \u00a0The Papa Del's horror stories that I know of first-hand and have heard (all from reliable sources) range from being hung up on over the phone while trying to order take-out to customers actually having their cars towed from the parking lot. \u00a0And still, I am giving Papa Del's four stars. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Because everytime I bite into that first thick bite, I am once again surprised by it's woderful deliciousness.Papa Del's is to pizza what a wife-beater is to marriage. \u00a0They'll break you down and disrespect you, yet somehow they have the power to keep you crawling back, begging for more. \u00a0Please don't leave me Papa Del's! \u00a0I have been blacklisted from the delivery list once before (long story, I learned my lesson) and I never want to go back there again!If loving you is wrong, Papa Del's, well then, Baby, I don't ever want to be right.", 
      "Best Pizza-in C-U. The thick (it's NOT Chicago-style Pan) is amazing and unlike anything I've ever had anywhere else. I've been going there 30+ years and it's always been great.Get it to go-service is slowwwww.", 
      "Great pizza, my mom even said she thought it was better than Chicago style IN Chicago. I don't know if I'd go so far as to say that, but it is some damn good pizza. I've never had a type of pizza there I dislike. Last time I had spinach and fresh garlic which was fantastic, though I usually order plain cheese or sausage. Note: If you're on a time crunch, either don't go here, or call in your order ahead of time. They warn you it takes 55 minutes, and it really does take that long... if not longer. It's worth the wait, if you have the time.", 
      "Don't come here if you have any sort of time constraints. The only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because I didn't actually get to taste the food. I came here for lunch knowing that there would probably be a wait. But, I was craving some chicago style pizza, and I had an hour so I thought I'd be fine.I walk in and stare at the 2 workers in the place for 5 minutes. Finally he asks \"Can I help you?\" Something about the way he said it just rubbed me the wrong way. It felt like he thought I was intruding upon his precious time. Granted, the restaurant was pretty full, and they seemed understaffed so I just asked for a table. He told me to \"sit tight\", which I did. I sat tight for at least 15 minutes without anyone paying any more attention to me. An update on time would have been really nice. Even just saying a word to remind me that I hadn't become invisible would have been appreciated. Of course they were too busy running past me to say anything though. After wasting 20 minutes of my lunch break, I gave up and left.Hopefully I can come back and actually try the food. But, the service here is really poor from what I can tell. The pizza better be amazing; otherwise, I don't think I'll be tempted to come back here.", 
      "Overrated. Big time.To be fair, I do not like deep dish or Chicago style pizza. But I figured I would see if I had changed my mind. I haven't.Wait is WAY too long, pizza is boring and you may as well eat bread with sauce and cheese on the side. Will not be visiting again.", 
      "For full disclosure purposes, I worked at Del's in the early 'Nineties. I stopped in a couple of weeks ago and was in heaven from the heady smell and the curiously identical everything else! Pops is still making some of the best Deep Dish anywhere.The decor is dated, the pies take forever in that five-deck oven, and the service is a bit lackluster. \u00a0But the food is great old school pizzeria. \u00a0Get the Italian Salad as an appetizer. Proceed to the Sicilan Pan pizza (although the Stuffed and Thin are solid--just not as good). Not fancy, brother. \u00a0Just tasty. \u00a0 Still good cold the next day. \u00a0Bank on it.", 
      "The best Chicago-style pizza anywhere is not in Chicago. On one trip to Illinois we had Lou Malnati's, Pizzeria Uno and Giordano's pizza, aka the trifecta. Then we visited my family in Champaign and grabbed a couple of slices of cheese pizza to go from Papa Del's before driving to O'Hare. We inhaled them in the car, and I swear, that beat those fancy Chicago places hands down. I love all kinds of pizza...East Coast, West Coast, you name it...but when it comes down to it, it's Pop's for pizza or no place at all ;-)Oh yeah, and order take out. Don't judge this place by the dining experience; \u00a0just get the pizza. I lived in C-U for the first 17 years of my life and have gone back once or twice a year for the last 20. Of the hundreds of Papa Dels pizzas I've had, I can probably count the number of times I've eaten there on 2 hands. Who cares?", 
      "All of those giving Papa Del's one or two stars, I want to fight you. \u00a0Especially those of you knocking it down because of its service... here's the thing... you go to Papa Del's for the best pizza you have ever eaten. \u00a0You want fast service? Go get a pizza at Pizza Hut express and leave one more table open at Papa's...The secret is, call ahead. \u00a0It does take 45 to 55 minutes for them to cook a pizza, that's how good (and thick) they are. \u00a0This place is, hands down, my favorite pizza ever... however if you are especially anal about service, just get it delivered. \u00a0Whatever you do though, if you are in Champaign, don't leave town without tasting this true circle of cheest awesomeness.", 
      "We stopped in Champaign on our cross country trek. \u00a0After looking at reviews of various pizzerias, we decided to try Papa Del's and the research was well worth it! \u00a0One of the best pizzas I've had!! \u00a0A tasty reward after a long day's drive!", 
      "Best pizza ever. \u00a0This place puts Chicago and New York pizza to shame.That said, the service is slow and clumsy. \u00a0If you plan to eat in the restaurant, call your order in about 25 minutes before you arrive.", 
      "Amazing pizza. A good idea to call your order in ahead of time as the pies take a long time to bake. Totally worth the wait! Delicious!", 
      "Among my favorite memories from my days as a student at Illinois would have to be when a professor saw me working on a project late one night in the lab and said \"oh Hi Michael, we have some leftover pizza, want some?\" And the leftover pizza turned out to be half a deep dish pizza from Papa Dels. That I devoured completely on my own. Oh sweet free deliciousness.Everybody has their own opinions about the best pizza in Chambanavoy. Unfortunately, many of them are wrong. Papa Dels is the best. Half a medium cheese deep dish is enough to kick my fat butt. However, it does take forever and it is fairly spendy.Eating in is not always awesome. Being that it takes them 45+ minutes to cook a pizza, you'll see a lot of people sitting around waiting for their pizza (since some people are silly enough not to call in their order ahead of time). This means that it can sometimes be tricky to get seated - due to all the people waiting (AKA Papa Del's noobs). Service ranges from mediocre to OK.Bathrooms are clean and they have toilet paper that is a step or two above \u00a0the stadium grade/industrial sandpaper variety.Overall, I can't imagine Chambanavoy without Papa Del's. It is awesome. I wish it were cheaper and faster, but I also wish that I had Super Man's abilities. Can't have everything you want in life, you know? I guess I'm just going to have to drown my sorrows in another delicious Papa Del's pizza. Nom nom nom.", 
      "The best deep dish pizza ever. \u00a0The first time I ate here I could only eat one slice. \u00a0I have now graduated and can eat almost 3. \u00a0I want to eat even more, but I can't handle it. \u00a0We now order from the Crossing location since it is closer to home, but we used to pick-up from this location (they didn't deliver to our area). If you are going to sit down, a couple things to note. \u00a01) parking sucks during busy periods. \u00a02) It takes 45 min to cook the pizza...so you will have to wait. My family sent me a couple of their frozen pizzas through the mail service, but the pizzas do not cook the same at home. \u00a0If you absolutely can't get good deep dish pizza wherever you are located, I can understand ordering it. \u00a0Otherwise, just wait till the next time you are in Champaign to get some.", 
      "I am not a fan of Papa Del's although it is a Champaign staple. \u00a0I was going to give 2 stars but i just couldn't do that. \u00a0ALOT of people love Papa Del's and have for many ,many years. \u00a0I am not one of them and I can't figure out why. \u00a0It tastes fine. \u00a0I just would not go out of my way to get one. \u00a0They are big and heavy and take a long time to cook. \u00a0Every time we have ordered one for work I have to wait when I arrive because it is still cooking. \u00a0Every time. \u00a0It's a messy kind of pizza too so maybe that's another reason I am not fond of it. \u00a0I would not recommend it nor would I discourage anyone from trying. \u00a0Seriously on the fence with this one.My advice is try it for yourself then decide what you think and Yelp about it.", 
      "Orgasmic deep dish pizza. Park in the back of the place and the shop is upstairs. We got one pizza with cheese, and one veggie. Even having leftovers the next day was amazing.If you have 20 coupons, you get $10 off your order. In California, nothing compares to papa del's. Don't take this for granted!", 
      "Went out to this pizza joint with my swim team hoping for decent pizza. I was incredibly happy to find that the pizza was delicious. I ordered the signature pan pizza with pepperoni. It was everything you love about Chicago-style deep dish pizza down in Champaign. Unfortunately, the meal takes a long time to be served. We sat down at 4:40 and didn't get out good until 5:45 rolled around. Quickie review: Go here whenever you can! Food-wise Papa Del's is some of the best Champaign can offer.", 
      "This would probably be a five-star for me, but I am trying not to include nostalgia in the review. \u00a0There are two things to tell you.If you haven't eaten here and are reading this review, then you are probably from out of town. \u00a0The one thing I can say that might influence your decision is this: the stuffed pizza here is better than any I can find in Chicago. \u00a0Honestly, I have tried everything and keep looking. \u00a0Stuffed pizza, foodie pizza, local pizza - none better. \u00a0That should be all I need to say.But once you get there the other thing you need to know is this: the service is epic slow. \u00a0Remember when you studied The Odyssey in school and the teacher told you about the oral tradition and it not being written down for a few centuries? \u00a0That is how they train the waitstaff here. \u00a0For decades the means of serving people in a lovingly slow and sometimes forgetful fashion have been passed down to new staff with such fidelity that I can only call the institutional memory involved Homeric. \u00a0Embrace it as part of the experience and realize that the name tags are hand written, the one old thing about the staff is that almost everyone seems new. \u00a0The pizza will eventually be delivered, be patient, it will be worth the wait.", 
      "Hands down, the best of the best. The smell alone will carve a hole in your stomach, it's so good, esp when you are hungry. I started with PD's in 1980 at UIUC, then left UIUC in 84, and came back several times for, er, 'business reasons', but the truth, I now admit, was to eat another deep dish Papa Dels pie... that's how damn good they are. Don't bother taking a frozen home...I tried that and wept it was so not the real thing. \u00a0The tomato sauce and the crust are some special recipe, for which if I could get ahold of it, I would start Papa Dels Silicon Valley and make trillions.", 
      "I subscribe very strongly to the belief that bad pizza does not exist. Even the worst pizza is, at the very least, edible.That said, Papa Del's, which should be near the top of the pizza pantheon falls squarely short of mediocre. I know I'm in a very, very small minority here but honestly, I'd just as soon get Pizza Hut. It's cheaper and doesn't take as long. For me, the taste is about the same.Part of this could be my status as a \"thin-crust guy\" but even after trying their thin crust, I wasn't impressed. Besides the sauce being of the persuasion that induces heart burn 90% of the time for me, the crust wasn't like a cracker, but more like cardboard. I won't comment too much on the deep dish, but I will say that the sausages were nice and crispy which is something I'd like to see more on pizza in general. The crust, which should be the best part of deep dish was kind of chewy......for me. I'm not the definitive pizza reviewer.I would give this place three stars; however, minus one star for service, which was really bad. We had a large group and one of the servers in particular was rather abrasive when we asked to have a large table. Our main server didn't do a good job either of keeping drinks filled, which normally is not a pet peeve for me, but when I've gone an hour sans fill up, I tend to get cranky.", 
      "I LOATHE Deep Dish Pizza. I have grown up in the Chicago metro area and have enjoyed most of the staples, like vienna beef hot dogs, italian beef, and gyros. However, I am a minimalist when it comes to pizza, and so, I like as few things on it as possible. The very concept of deep dish pizza goes against this philosophy of mine, almost to the point where I wouldn't even consider it pizza at all.Regardless of that, I will gladly eat a medium sausage deep dish style pizza from Papa Del's any day. Yes, Papa Del's serves the only deep dish pizza I will eat anywhere. I think that's a good enough endorsement.Don't overlook their thin crust pizza, though. It's every bit as good as the deep dish in my opinion and it's a solid option for the lighter appetites.I can't really say the service itself is bad like all of the other reviewers are saying. However, you will probably wait at least 45 minutes if you are ordering a pizza of any kind, so be warned.", 
      "Truly authentic Chicago style pizza! My boyfriend is from Chicago and although we now live in central Indiana, we still love a good Lou Manalti's pie when we get a chance.We had never been here before, and although it was about 7pm on a Saturday night, we were able to get a table without a wait. There was, however, quite a wait before a server came by to take our order; it was probably 15 minutes and then we finally just flagged someone down.Boeyond that, everything was great. We ordered a pan pizza and after an hour (which they tell you is the wait time for a pan pizza), it was brought out in all its glory. It was amazing. Just like a Manalti pizza exept it lacked the one thing I HATE about most Chicago style pizzas - the chunky sauce! The sauce was smooth but flavorful and full of spices. I cannot stand chunky pizza sauce so I was very excited. It was SO GOOD. The slices were so thick and loaded that I was full after just one. We ended up taking more than half the pie home.Our dining partners had the \"thin crust\", and I use quotes because it really was what I would consider to be hand tossed in thickness. It looked wonderful and I would like to try it next time.All in all, worth the wait. The building is set up oddly but they make it work. There is a full bar and the menu also includes pastas and sandwiches if you are not feeling a pizza.", 
      "Listen up people, if you want the 5 star pizza, wait the hour and order a whole pizza for takeout. If you want the 1 star pizza, just go eat at the place and order by the slice. I promise you, there is a dramatic difference. This is why you're yelp users. You should KNOW these things!This pizza, if ordered to-go, is the best pizza in the city, and probably that I've ever eaten. I now live in Chicago and I STILL crave this thing.", 
      "So, the food is so awesome here that I do not mind waiting an hour for a deep dish pizza to be served to me. I'll admit I'm a big fan of deep dish, and not everyone is...but I've also tried their regular crust pizza and it's also quite tasty. The seating is one of the drawbacks of this place though. \u00a0Sometimes this place gets so packed that you can't get a seat for another half hour from when you arrived, BUT at least you can put your pizza order in and save time, which is great. \u00a0It would be great if the place looked cleaner, but I don't really mind because the food is tasty.In my earlier post I said the waiters are pretty good. \u00a0I TAKE THAT BACK!They are terrible. There is actually one girl in particular that is just obnoxious. When I came with a group of friends we made sure to order half vegetarian pizza and half meaty pizza. Sounds easy enough. Well, the waitress ended up bringing us a full meaty pizza and when I told her that's not what we ordered she said \"I heard all meat\" and walked away. SERIOUSLY? When she came back to fill our drinks my other friend got really pissed and said you could have at least offered to fix the problem...she just rolled her eyes and walked away. Finally, she ended up bringing a personal thin crust for my bf, but it was ridiculous the attitude she gave us. Isn't the customer always right? I clearly stated what we wanted on our pizza, is that so hard to understand?Despite the terrible service, I'd say this is the best pizza place in Urbana-Champaign, and sometimes even when I'm in Chicago i cannot help but get a craving for Papa Dels deep dish. MMM", 
      "Chicago-style pizza is a religious sort of thing. \u00a0Maybe you think Gino's East is the best, maybe Giordano's. \u00a0Maybe you think that Papa Del's can't possible compare. \u00a0All that's fine if you're willing to make a five-hour pilgrimage every time you want to eat pizza.But most people aren't, so it's good that Papa Del's is at least in the ballpark. \u00a0This is really great pizza, and easily the best Chicago-style you're going to get in Champaign.Plus they've got a deep-dish by-the-slice on weekdays for lunch.", 
      "It's Pops for Pizza or No Place at All. \u00a0Seriously - this is the best pizza you will ever have - deep dish, that is. \u00a0And yes, I've had Chicago pizza at the \"institutions\" and this is still way better. \u00a0Beware though, the place is insane on weekends and it takes 45 minutes to bake a pie so call ahead if you think you're going to be bored talking to your table-mates for that long. \u00a0I would give Papa Dels 5 stars but the last 3 times I've been there, the service has sucked - not the rude sucky, but they have jacked up our order every time! \u00a0We want thick, they give us thin. We wanted pepperoni, they give us sausage. \u00a0This last time we asked to see the manager and tried to at least get a free 'za out of it - \"no free food here - owner's policy,\" he says. \u00a0Normally this would piss me off so much I would never go back, but the pizza is just so damn good I do anyway. \u00a0Sigh.", 
      "This is what pizza is supposed to be. Thick, chewy, substantial, no-nonsense, DELICIOUS. \u00a0The Platonic ideal. They have a thin-crust pizza but honestly I've never bothered, nor has anyone else I know. I'm not sure what the point would be. They lack one star because every so often the bottom of the crust is burned horribly. Sad!!", 
      "OH yeah.....you know that Chicago Style Pizza is the only kind of pizza that can be called a meal. \u00a0New York Style, that is a lunch kind of pizza. \u00a0If you want a real meal, then Deep Dish is what you want. \u00a0And if you can't get to Chicago to have some Lou Malnatti's and are in Champaign / Urbana then you have to go to Papa Del's.Just beware, this delectably deep dish pie takes 55 minutes to bake. \u00a0If you are hungry and need the quick hit of Chicago's best food then call ahead. \u00a0But if you are like me and can let a great meal take its due course, you can order a pitcher of your favorite brew and enjoy that while taking it easy and conversating with your friends. \u00a0After all, Deep Dish Pizza is all about sharing, because no man, and I mean no man can tackle a Large Deep Dish Sausage by himself.The only reason why this place gets a 4 instead of a 5 is because their Shiner Bock was flat, the service was not so great, and they are not in Chicago. \u00a0If these things were remedied, they would easily be a 5 star, but sadly rural Illinois is not Chicago....", 
      "Born and raised in Chicago eating Chicago style pizza. \u00a0As a loyal Lou Malnatti patron, I can support Papa Del's stuffed pizza. \u00a0Takes 45-55 minutes which is just a fact that has to be accepted. \u00a0They have great sausage that they cook before making the pizza which provides a great carmalised crispy texture and taste that adds another layer of experience.Had Papa Del's in college 20 years ago and went back with my daughter this week and it is the same. \u00a0Great to see it serving up the same great pie.Lunch time they sell pre-made pizza by the slice. \u00a0Pan pizza with one topping but gets you quick pizza without the wait. \u00a0But the stuffed pizza is not offered.If you like greesy pizza or are a thin pizza fan then Papa's isn't for you. \u00a0But don't rate it then. \u00a0Like rating an Sushi place down because you don't like raw fish.", 
      "First, let's correct a slight misconception. \u00a0This is not exactly Chicago-style pizza. \u00a0Although it may not seem possible to those whose conception of pizza centers on the east coast or California styles, Papa Del's thick crust is noticeably doughier, thicker, heavier, and more casserole-like than anything being served at a classic Chicago-style pizza place. \u00a0Our of respect for pizza aficionados, I have to note that there's a slight difference in kind, not degree, between what Giordano's serves and what Papa Del's serves.But second, it's still fantastic pizza. \u00a0It may seem pricey, but an 8-piece thick crust pizza can easily serve 4-6 because the slices are so filling and thick (it can feed 7 if you're like me and always have 6 sorority girls on diets hanging out with you). \u00a0The tomato sauce is delicious and perfectly-spiced and with the doughy crust it forms almost a focaccia taste (like a real focaccia taste and not what you get at Friday's). \u00a0The meat toppings are the best (bacon, pepperoni, and sausage are all great). \u00a0I would advise against getting onions, as they can overpower the rest of the pizza, but it's still very, very good thick-crust pizza and it's well worth the lengthy wait.It's not a 5-star because the dine-in service/experience is poor. \u00a0I strongly, strongly recommend getting take-out. \u00a0Also note the calender; if it's an Illinois home football or basketball game, call 60-90 minutes in advance and do not try to eat-in. \u00a0And the thin crust is lousy.", 
      "Not much to say other than that we love this. My wife and I always choose this pizza, so far our favorite in town. We go stuffed with spinach and are always satisfied.One caveat: the wait can be long (delivery often takes over an hour, so plan ahead or don't bother when you're starving).", 
      "I love this place!!! \u00a0They have some of the best deep dish pizza I've ever tasted!!Like, OMG it's sooo good!!!Yes. You will wait a while to get it. So sit back with your friends and/or family, and enjoy spending time with them, while you wait for the amazing pizza that's sure to please everyone. And it's worth the wait (and any potentially awkward conversations you must endure. You only came with a group because no one can eat a whole Papa Del's pizza by themselves! And who wants to sit alone at a restaurant? (On the other hand, who wants to share something this delicious?) ) I kid, but seriously, it's worth it!If you leave this place still hungry....you are doing something very very wrong. (Unless you got your food to-go, because you won't have eaten it yet!!)It is scrumptious. I don't know what I like more...the cheese, or the sauce? It's different than anything I've ever had.Every time I've been here, it's been crowded, or at the very least, it's busy. That's always a good sign! And the service has always been good.I love this place.Excuse me, I have to go wipe the drool off my keyboard...", 
      "Gosh, I hate to be a buzz kill, but this pizza is just plain thick. \u00a0There's practically no flavor. \u00a0I don't think it's just a Chicago thing. \u00a0But it's a UIUC institution and I do enjoy going, but I usually have one of the entrees instead of pizza - that's why it gets the high three-star rating.However, cold, the next day, a slice of Del's makes for a decent lunch - I don't know what it is, it just tastes better to me that way.", 
      "Papa Del's is my favorite stuff crust pizza ever. \u00a0Oh man... back when I was in school, it used to be a real treat to go here. \u00a0Usually, if someone was visiting and had a car, this was one of the destinations. \u00a0The pizza takes a LONG time to make, which is expected. \u00a0But it's SO delicious.I live up in Chicago now, but I haven't forgotten you Papa Del's!!", 
      "Somehow, it took me till my last few weeks of undergrad at uiuc to go here. \u00a0I \u00a0was expecting the best Chicago style pizza in town, and yeah, it probably is. \u00a0But it doesn't compete with Chicago-area Chicago style pizza so I must say I still was a little disappointing.I got a stuffed pizza with spinach. \u00a0I felt like there could have been a lot more spinach on it, and something about the crust just didn't seem right. \u00a0It was tasty and pretty soft, but the bottom was surprisingly hard and it seemed like the crust to pizza ratio was too high. \u00a0Also, we got a loaf of garlic bread for the wait. \u00a0It wasn't bad, but I've made better garlic bread at home. \u00a0Some parts of the loaf were just too dry and bland. \u00a0It was pretty cheap though, so no big deal.I guess overall, if you want a Chicago-style pizza, then go for it. \u00a0But try to hit up a pizza place in the Chicago area sometime!", 
      "I've had better pizza in cleaner, more efficiently operated places, but it's hard to say Papa Del's isn't at least pretty good. \u00a0 The menu is very, very limited. \u00a0 \u00a0If you don't want the Big Three toppings - pepperoni, cheese, sausage - you could have a plain crust, I guess, but there's no chicken, pineapple, Canadian bacon, steak, jalape\u00f1os or anything else even a millimeter away from conventional. \u00a0 That said, the pizza was pretty good, if unoriginal. \u00a0 The atmosphere of the place was lively. \u00a0 \u00a0Being able to pre-order is a stroke of genius - you put your name in for a table and your pizza order. \u00a0 By the time you have a table, the food is on its way. \u00a0 This place is a U of I tradition. \u00a0 Far be it from me to diss Papa Del's. \u00a0 \u00a0However, like the Illini football team, Papa Dels could stand a little work improving their game.", 
      "The big daddy of pizzas. \u00a0The Sicilian style pizza is a monstrosity of a pie. \u00a0Starting from the bottom, there's, a thick, yeasty bread crust. \u00a0On top of that there's a layer of oozing mozzarella cheese. \u00a0On top of that are the toppings - sausages the size of meatballs, onions, peppers, whatever, and then there's a sweet tomato sauce slathered over the top of everything. \u00a0OMG! \u00a0There's no delicate way to eat this beast! \u00a0This is the pizza that made U of I famous!", 
      "I've had stuffed pizza all over and I have to say that this is still my favorite (stuffed, mind you...), by far. \u00a0Every so often when I'm in town I grab a large super stuffed with mushrooms, sausage, and spinach home. \u00a0The ingredients are fresh and the sauce is very well balanced with just a bit of tang. \u00a0That, and they practically put huge chunks of sausage in there.... if they just had whole mushrooms instead of sliced, that would rock.", 
      "WoW!I never had pizza like this before...I think I found my ultimate favorite Chicago-style pizza! \u00a0I mean we got the \"superstuffed\" and it was EXACTLY that: superstuffed with cheese, sauce, pepperoni, and crust! LoL.No wonder Clinton came here before he was hospitalized! LoL.I mean, I still prefer the New York THIN crust pizza, but if I ever opted for Chicago-style, I know where to get it in Champaign! ;)"

      "Yeah, this pizza is amazing. The deep dish pizza is a long wait - at least 45 minutes - but you can call ahead to get your pizza started. Highly recommended. But you can load the pizza with all kinds of toppings, and they're baked right into the copious amounts of cheese they give you. Couple that with a buttery, flaky crust that you are seriously happy to eat, and you have a winning pie.Pair the pizza with some cheesy garlic bread to start the meal, and the attentive service will keep your drink full while you wait. Anytime I go back to Champaign, I gotta have Papa Del's.", 
      "It's not the BEST deep dish, but it's pretty darn good. Been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. They used to have Shiner Bock on tap, but not anymore. I'll settle for Blue Moon. Friendly wait staff and never a super long wait for a table (unless you decide to go on a game or parent weekend, which I never do). My go-to place for deep dish in C-U", 
      "Compared to Gino's East in downtown Chicago, this place gets 4 stars.Compared to everywhere else that sells deep dish pizza, this place is easily 5 stars.The deep dish is done right at Papa Del's. \u00a0Lot's of tasty toppings, cheese, and sauce piled on top of the crispy crust. \u00a0Don't let other \"deep dish\" joints fool you. \u00a0It's not just a thick slab of dough. \u00a0If done well, the dough is relatively thin because all the fillings are held inside.I have a friend who brings home 2 Papa Del's pizzas back to St. Louis to his parents every time he goes home because they went to Illinois back in the day, and they just can't stop eating it. \u00a0That's quality!", 
      "Why did I come here: Friends told me it was a must and was the best pizza in town. Location: Good for college students living west of Campustown. A little far of a walk for lunch but possible.Food: You go here for the pizza-Really good thick crust -buttery/oily crust-good sauce -A good variety of toppingsAtmosphere: A good place for groups but can be loud at times like on Fridays.Advice: If you are on a time crunch, order ahead of time because it takes awhile for your order to arrive.", 
      "During our visit, we ordered their pan pizza. \u00a0It wasn't very busy but the wait was still 45 mins (I can't imagine what the time would be if it was during the busy hours). \u00a0The pizza was great, superb! \u00a0It was the thickest pizza I have ever had and can understand why the wait is what it is. \u00a0I live in the north suburbs of Chicago, and my favorite pan pizzas are Silo and Lou Malnati's. \u00a0It is hard to choose which I like more, but this was a nice change from my standard. \u00a0A side salad and one piece was plenty. \u00a0They offer pizza by the slice but then you won't have any leftovers. \u00a0That's no fun!They have their own parking in the back so you don't have to feed the meter.", 
      "Based on the testimonials from other Yelpers, sounds like it was a good call to enjoy Papa Del's from the comforts of my in-law's home. We had champagne to accompany our Chicago-style pizza, which is my new favorite eating-take-out-at-home thing - the champagne and pizza combination, not necessarily Chicago-style.It's like eating a pie o' pizza and, apparently, Papa Del's does it better than most joints in The Windy City. Stuffing is entirely customizable and we were treated to a sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers and onions smorgasbord. My mom-in-law also raves about a spinach something or other.PRO'S: Eat less to feel satiated, didn't seem as oily.CON'S: Gotta use utensils to eat hot (just had some cold for lunch, sans fork and knife).Sorry Papa, this is one time I'm picking a girl over a guy - I'll forever be enamored to my Hot Mama's.", 
      "My parents introduced my brother and I to Papa Del's when they took me on a pilgremmage to Champaign for Homecoming when I was in high school (we're from Iowa). \u00a0We were young, naive, and whined about the wait. \u00a0But as soon as we finally tasted the pizza, we were believers. \u00a0I've has Chicago style pizza... and this isn't a substitute, it is the best. This is, hands down, my favorite pizza in the world. \u00a0My family drives 2 hours out of the way on an 18 hour car trip to SC just to stop for Papa Del's on the way down, in the middle of the night.Homecoming is a month away and my mouth is watering just thinking about this place!!!", 
      "It's the best pizza I have ever had. \u00a0I haven't found any pizza that comes close to it. \u00a0The buttery crust, delicious sauce, generous cheese - it just comes together superbly. \u00a0If you're a vegetarian (the grease from the pepperoni/sausage does magical things) or like thin crust or are cheap - don't bother. A lot of the 1 star peeps are talking about service. \u00a0The service is sketchy at best - I would always call ahead and pick-up. \u00a0It's so worth it. \u00a0If anybody knows a place in Chicago that is as good - let me know. \u00a0Malnati's and Giordano's - they're good, but not as good...", 
      "Mmmmm. Best deep-dish in town. \u00a0(Not sure that there's much competition, though.)Whether ordering delivery or in the restaurant, expect to wait about an hour. I've only been in the restaurant once, and it was nice and relaxed. I've ordered delivery from them countless times whenever I have guests, and it never disappoints. Melty, cheesy, tomatoey...so good. It's kind of pricey, but I usually just eat one to two pieces and am completely stuffed, so it's really not bad.", 
      "I have eaten at over a dozen deep dish pizza restaurants around the country, including some of the most famous in Chicago (Lou's, Uno, Giordano's, etc) and still Papa Del's is the best. \u00a0Be ready to wait for your pie, it takes a solid 45 minutes to bake this pizza. \u00a0But it is worth every minute! \u00a0They do delivery, take out, and dine in at this location. \u00a0The other location is only pickup and delivery. \u00a0Wait staff is friendly, quick, and proficient, some of them have been there for years. \u00a0Make sure you get the Sicilian style, if you get thin you're doing it wrong.", 
      "LOVE this place! \u00a0If you've never been I definitely recommend it!", 
      "Oh Papa Del's how I love you.Get the deep dish stuffed pizza (stuff it with spinach) and add pepperoni uuffffff :D Perfect.Thin crust is also excellent, and it's good with sausage on it.", 
      "Papa D's, as I like to call it, is the most awesomest (deep-dish) pizza in Champaign, if you order 90 minutes before you're hungry. Papa Del's is an institution in Champaign-Urbana. I've read reviews that say it's not as good as Chicago's own Chicago-style. To that I say Bull-hocky! You're just hating on Champaign because you're here for school and you miss you're hometown! I've had Papa D's deep dish and Gino's East in Chi-town. Side-by-side I don't think I could tell the difference. I've never ordered a thin crust or a sandwich at Papa D's so I can only speak to their most beloved menu item, the Super-Stuffed pizza. (The pizza President Clinton ordered when Air Force One landed in Champaign). I have nothing to say other than it's awesome. It's great. It's the bee's knees. It's the spider's web. (does that last one make sense?). Seriously though, if you like stuffed pizza, get a Papa Del's sausage (or pepperoni) and spinach (unless you hate spinach). Two big draw backs to Papa D's: It's on campus. So us townies can wait to sample it's offers three times a year (spring break, summer break, and winter break), or, or!, order from the NEW, NEW! location at Village at the Crossing (you're welcome Papa D, call (217) 359-5500). I've never ordered from that location, but I've eaten that location's pizza and it's just as awesome as the Green street location, minus the students and traffic.The other big drawback is the delicious deep-dish takes a while to create and bake, so you have to be patient or order ahead of time. If you dine-in at the Green Street location you can plan on waiting 90 minutes if you're in a large group. Alone or in a smaller group the usual wait time is closer to 45 minutes. If you order-out or arrive when the students are gone you can expect to wait less. BOTTOM LINE:Great food + long wait time - fair price - \"I can't believe you haven't tried this already\" = worth it. If you live in Champaign more than a year and you like pizza, I won't respect you if you haven't at least tired Papa D's (stuffed pizza).", 
      "Best Chicago-style pizza in town!!!!!If you are in town you should go here!!!! The pizza is just amazing!!!!", 
      "This is hands down my favorite pizza place. Every time I come back to visit my hometown, I make sure to order a large Sicilian pan pizza with sausage, garlic, and black olives, with a side of pepperoncinis. Delivery time is usually 60-75 minutes, and I don't mind the wait because the pizza is heavenly.", 
      "Best deep dish in town, nay south of Chicago. Orders take a while but that's to be expected with pizza this size. Sausage is amazing too. Breadsticks aren't my fav but decent.", 
      "I've had a million good experiences here, and only one bad. Ordered a thin crust here once, for pickup, and I sat and waited for it near the counter while they overcooked it. But I don't know what possessed me to order thin-crust anyway. I had never done it before and never will again, because their deep pizzas (they have both pan and stuffed) are EASILY the best in Champaign-Urbana. The crust is a lot like Giordano's. Every time I'm back in Chambana I have to get Del's.", 
      "Best pizza in champaign/urbana hands down. \u00a0No one else is even close to Papa Del's pan pizza. \u00a0I get a pie with sausage and mushrooms and i can't ask for much more in my pizza, for some strange reason, i find the pizza is even better warmed up the next day as a leftover than it is freshly served.Want to try some sandwiches as well, but have a hard time getting past the pizza.", 
      "This University of Illinois campus fixture has the \"best\" Sicilian pizza due to the crust, cheese, sauce & sausage -- not to short change any of the other additional ingredients (pepperoni, mushrooms, etc) or the \"thin\" pizza, or the cheese garlic bread, or the...OK, I'm a fan... since the late 70s (oh, am I showing my age). \u00a0A proof point is that while driving Columbus, OH to Chicago I went through Champaign just to pick up a pie to go.4 stars, versus 5 is due to the ongoing problem of \"table management\" during rush periods where tables will be \"empty\" between seatings while there is a line of people waiting out the door & around the corner.That being said, once seated, service has been consistently good through the \"generations\" of waitstaff that we have had. And other than football weekends, seating has not been a problem. The bar is fairly well stocked.Oh, this last round, I had bacon and it was 1/4 strips on the pie -- FANTASTIC.", 
      "I had heard about Papa Del's and was excited to try it after reading the reviews. I ordered a pepperoni, sausage and mushroom (my go-to pizza). The parking was difficult to find because it's on the side of the building. Up the stairs is where you pay and when I got up there, the service was not very friendly. After paying and walking to my car, I noticed that the grease from the pizza was ooozing out of the box and dripped onto my jeans. I was fairly pissed about that, not only did it stain my jeans, but I knew I ordered a greasy pizza.Deep dish pizza was pretty good, but there was soo much sauce and not enough cheese. I usually enjoy pizza, equally if not more on the second day of eating it, and this pizza was not very good on day two. Overall, I'm not sure if I would go back, but I'm glad that I tried it. I think there are better pizzas around town.", 
      "Some of the best pizza you can get in CU. Pizza can take quite a while to cook, so be prepared to wait (but it's totally worth it).Most of my experience with Papa Del's Pizza is actually through info sessions held by companies on campus - the promise of a hearty slice of Papa Del's is enough to lure many into the room. Just one slice is a filling meal. Would definitely recommend!", 
      "I am not from Champaign-Urbana, however I visit every other year or so and never miss the opportunity to eat at Papa Del's. \u00a0I seriously have dreams about their deep dish with everything on it. \u00a0The crust is so tasty, the toppings are fresh and yummy. \u00a0I love the big sausage chunks and garlic, and the tomato chunks in the sauce...sure it might take a long time, but that's why you can call ahead and order a pizza and a table so you don't have to wait as long when you get there! \u00a0I read other complaints about slow waitstaff?...who cares? \u00a0Get a beer, bring a friend, relax and enjoy yourself!I am tempted to try their overnight shipping so I can get my Del's fix in Texas. \u00a0Maybe for my birthday...",

      "Papa Del's is my favorite pizza restaurant, and definitely worth the wait. For delivery, I've experienced it taking everywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours to arrive, but I'd say it is most often 45-60 minutes. If you are planning to dine in at the restaurant, I would recommend calling the restaurant about 20 minutes before you plan to be there to pre-order your pizza. This significantly cuts down on your waiting time at the restaurant. Take out is the fastest option. My pizza has always been ready within 45 minutes of placing my order.The deep dish \"pan\" pizza is their specialty. The toppings are always fresh and delicious. I order garlic on every pizza I get from Papa Del's because it is just so fresh and delicious. I'm not a big sausage fan, but I enjoy theirs very much. My favorite combination of toppings to get is garlic, sausage, black olives, and green peppers. Yum.",

      "Papa Del, you are one overrated sonofabitch. \u00a0Your pizza is edible, but just not the real deal, and your service blows. \u00a0You're a staid Chambana eatery, and I respect that, but I just don't think we can be friends.", 
      "Let me start by saying: I LOVE this pizza! Ok, that's where the love stops. The service is terrible. Not just terrible, awful even! You arrive, you place your order. You enjoy a beer, maybe another. The server comes back to get your order. Wait, I already ordered? You place it again, waiting...waiting. Finally, after an eternity, a manager comes out: \"she forgot to put your pizza order in.\" Really? Seriously? After placing it twice? We order again. 40 minutes later, we get a pizza. It's delicious. But, we could have been in Chicago for the time it took to get. And then, at least, we would have been in Chicago. I \"suppose\" if you like to complain and feel you want to wait a small eternity for a pizza (that's delicious!) go to Papa Del's. However, if you've had your fill of being treated poorly, find somewhere else!", 
      "The pizza is good, the closest thing to Chicago deep dish in the area as far as I know.The problem with this place is that the owner/manager shows complete contempt for the customers. \u00a0There are signs posted all over the place admonishing customers for this, that, and the other. \u00a0They will actually tow their customers cars if they park in one of the spots closest to the back entrance which they reserve for their delivery drivers (aside: isn't it customary to have your employees park at the far end of the lot to reserve the good spots for your customers?) \u00a0The first time I went in to pick up a pizza, I was a bit taken aback bu the \"get the f out\" vibe. \u00a0Since then, I've heard a lot of horror stories from employees and customers about the way the owner treats people. \u00a0My favorite involved kicking out a family with an infant for bringing in outside food to feed the baby. \u00a0The kid had a bag of freakin' Cheerios. \u00a0I heard this from an assistant manager who ended up quitting because they just couldn't deal with having to treat people that way anymore.I've given up the tasty pizza on the premise that I'm really doing the owner a favor. \u00a0He clearly hates his customers, so now I'm one less thorn in his side.", 
      "We've tried Papa Del's twice and were disappointed both times. The first time we had the thin crust, and the second time we had the pan pizza. Both were just OK and we honestly do not feel we need to go back here again. The toppings selection is not only disappointingly short, but also overpriced. Our expectations are high coming from Gainesville, FL where they have Satchels, the most amazing pizza in the universe. We are still in search of a pizza place that we love enough to want to return to again and again in C-U. We haven't found it yet, but we like One World Pizza over Papa Del's pan pizza and Monicals wins out for value for a thin crust. It's sad that Monicals could beat a local favorite for us.",

      "Just an update, they do deliver! \u00a0It was crazy expensive, but worth it! \u00a0A medium frozen pizza with extra cheese and pepperoni costs about $110 next day delivery from Champaign to CA. \u00a0It was one of my memorable birthdays :).", 
      "I went here recently with some classmates for the first time and had an awful experience. We had a large group and ordered several deep dish pizzas. \u00a0The others came out as expected, but as their pizzas came to the table our waitress realized she had forgotten to put in the order for a deep dish pizza my friend and I were splitting. \u00a0This is a pretty big mistake to make considering it takes a good 45 minutes to an hour to make a deep dish. \u00a0What's worse is what happened after that. Instead of offering to bring us an appetizer on the house or something to hold us over (I was pretty starving at this point and we had already been there for an hour) she simply says \"I would understand if you don't tip me, I'm sorry\" \u00a0and offered to make us a thin crust instead. I don't care for thin crust pizza so I declined and said we would just wait. \u00a0About fifteen minutes later she comes by and offers some garlic bread so we accepted that. However, she waited so long to offer it that we got it just before our pizza came out and we no longer wanted it. Basically it was just a really frustrating experience and the waitress could have been more helpful considering it was her big mistake. \u00a0I also didn't realize that it costs $4 for a Diet Coke. I mean, it's a large cup, but c'mon. That's pretty steep even with getting a refill. On top of that, when we got our pizza, I was not impressed. For the time I spent here, I could have just driven to Chicago and had a real deep dish pizza. It might be the best in Champaign, but I don't think it's worth waiting for.", 
      "Oh.My.God. \u00a0Serious pizza orgasm. \u00a0I'm not even kidding. \u00a0If you don't stop by this place while in Urbana and try their pizza then I would say, in the immortal words of Mr. T, I pity the fool. \u00a0I'm actually looking into getting it mailed to me in Southern California. \u00a0Seriously, GO!"

      "this place rocks for artery clogging deep dish pizza. \u00a0being from chicago, i do miss deep dish pizza, and this doesn't disappoint. \u00a0the bread sticks are good, too. \u00a0however... the pasta? \u00a0meh. \u00a0it's nothing to write home about. \u00a0to be fair, this place isn't called papa del's pasta... it's called papa del's pizza, and they live up to the name. \u00a0the only thing i would say in a cautionary tone is... if you're ordering for delivery... be prepared to wait. \u00a0this pizza takes awhile to prepare, and if you're ordering a big one -- it takes even longer. \u00a0if you're starving and expect it to just show up like domino's -- you'll be disappointed.", 
      "Go with the Sicilian Pan. \u00a0We've been eating here for years and it never disappoints. \u00a0Be ready to wait 30 to 40 minutes for a pizza, but it's worth it. \u00a0Beer prices are not bad and service was great.", 
      "Very good deep dish pizza. Unlike Chicago-style deep dish, this crust is not flaky and buttery like a Lou Malnati's pie, but it's still very good- just a different style. The sauce is a bit sweet for my taste, but still good. The cheese is good (seems to be just mozz). They seem to use high quality toppings (have only had the pepperoni and sausage). Call ahead to place your order (menu on eatcu.com) so you don't have to wait an hour at the restaurant. It doesn't seem particularly clean....but I guess that's to be expected for an on-campus eatery that caters to easily satisfied students.", 
      "Papa Del's is the shit. Hands down the best pizza in Champaign. The pizza they make there is delicious the service is awesome. I agree with the dude from Peoria, AZ, if you want fast service, do go to pizza hut. What separates Del's pizza to Hut's pizza is the attention to detail the pizza you eat at Del's gets. There is a process t making their pizza. True can be said of Pizza Hut's, but Del's is deliberate and the end product is a pizza you can be proud to eat. I have eaten here 3 times and I loved it every time. Not only is the pizza delish, the place is immaculate. Walking in the restaurant, you are transported out of Central Illinois and to a different region of the world. There is a great contrast and this adds to the experience. There is a fountain, the tiles look like its from Italy, the two storied dining area gives the place a cool feel to it.The pricing is just right. True, to a person used to eating at Antonio's, Pizza Hut, or Sbarro, the pricing may seem high, but consider the quality of food compared to Papa Del's- not even close. So, it is well worth the extra few dollars to eat here. Plus the pizza is so damn filling. So, when you think about it, you are paying for your food for the day and possibly tomorrow.The only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because although they do accept credit cards in the store; they do not accept then for ordering out. I called there and I got less than desirable service. I wanted pizza to order out one day because I was too lazy to leave my apartment, but whatever, I wound up just walking back to the restaurant and ordering my food there. They should accept credit cards over the phone. But, that's about all I have to complain about. To summarize,Best- Great food, excellent service, unique looking place, big portions, reasonable priceWorst- Don't accept credit Cards over the phone", 
      "After graduating from UIUC Grad School, I often go to sleep thinking about this place. Their thin crust pizza's are my favorite. I also get the Italian Salad to go with it. They have excellent beers in bottle and on tap. I miss the days on a wintry night, either during or after the blizzards, where a cold beer and a hot pizza combo seem to do the trick to fill the void of the depressing winters. I can't thank them enough for helping me get through a tough time period in my life by serving a great pizza and beers. I came here alone to do my readings by the fire pit or with my peers for a social night. Either way, both types of customers are welcome.", 
      "Papa Dels is a good, solid, pizza place. They make good pizza and thats what they do. The pizza takes a while to make so either order ahead or get an appetizer and be ready to chat for a while. I generally prefer pick-up and just eat at home with friends and a movie or game.Papa Dels has two styles of pizza - thick and thin - both are excellent. So if you don't like Chicago style, don't forget to try their thin variety.", 
      "On rating pizza alone I would give papa dels 10 stars, it is that good, especially their stuffed pizza! However their service and restaurant are terrible. The restaurant is laid out like a dormitory's cafeteria and equally loud. The bar area is somewhat better but whoever designed that restaurant was an idiot. Loud, bright, annoying. Second, delivery. We live near Vine street in Urbana and they consider that out of their delivery area? What?? It used to be (and may still be I haven't checked) that you could not order the stuffed pizza ahead if you were eating there which meant you sat there, using up a table, for a full hour waiting for your amazing pizza. Customers are definitely not their first priority but fortunately amazing pizza is. I recommend pick up.", 
      "Best Pizza you're gonna find outside of Chicago in the C-U. Deep-dish style pizza.Order during lunch hours to get discounted slices for only $1.50 (carry-out only).Don't be cheap and order One World or Antonio's. Papa Del's is King.", 
      "I miss Papa Del's, even if I live in a pizza wonderland, I remember Papa Del's fondly for where to go in Chambana if you wanted really good, really hearty, deep dish style pizza. \u00a0The sauce if very flavorful, and the crust can take it. \u00a0I prefer eat in, and never really got papa del's for delivery, but did carry out occasionally. \u00a0It does suffer from sogginess when put in that cardboard box, better eaten fresh on location on a plate with a knife and fork. \u00a0Not the cheapest pizza in Champaign, just the best.", 
      "Best pizza in Champaign. I wish I had eaten here one last time before I left town.", 
      "Yum. \u00a0If you have to drop your son or daughter of at U of I, you can still expect first class pizza...BEST tip I can give you is ORDER AHEAD...takes a long time(they do say it on the menu, about the time, but still does not make it easier watching everyone around you shovel in very tasty pizza)-salads are decent...service is so-so...not dirt cheap but not crazy expensive...pizza is wonderful...", 
      "we came shortly before noon and the tables in the front area were full. our order took too long. it was for one cheese slice and a gluten free pizza for me, not difficult. my wife got bread sticks but that was the last we heard from our server for over an hour. we asked that our pizzas be boxed up. it came a few minutes later. I thought that my wife's slice of cheese was very thick and had a lot of pizza sauce.I understand that they have just started the gf crust, I would still prefer monicals or Jupiters for gluten free.", 
      "Got one of their pizza's to take home since I was in town. \u00a0It was pretty good for deep dish pizza but I have had better. \u00a0I ordered a small onion and mushroom. \u00a0The crust was subpar and there was very little sauce, cheese, and toppings; it was mostly dough. \u00a0It does take a while to cook the pizza, like 45 minutes from when we called from the mall. \u00a0Whether it takes that long when you eat in I cannot say.", 
      "If you own a jeep or SUV and want a mini off-road adventure within Champaign-Urbana, look no further than Papa Del's parking lot. Parents, be sure to watch your children very carefully when it's raining as there is no lifeguard on duty.All kidding aside, their pizza is great. I usually go over the noon hour and pick up a slice of their sausage or mushroom pizza, as a whole pizza is way too much for a singleton like me.Highly recommended if you haven't tried it.", 
      "Good stuff. Pricey by normal pizza standards.", 
      "This is the legendary stuff in CU. \u00a0Some people love it, some tolerate it, but many yearn for it years after they leave campus. \u00a0The place can get very busy, I usually call ahead and carry out since the space itself is loud and frankly not too memorable. \u00a0I love the tomato sauce and cheese taste. \u00a0Many people overlook the thin crust, which I like, esp. when I don't want the volume of the pan. \u00a0The stuffed is too much for me. \u00a0Surprisingly, the sandwiches are a cut above what you would expect at a place like this - an afterthought. \u00a0A note: \u00a0Years ago they used to have a location on Wright. St. where they sold sandwiches and slices. \u00a0That was nice, and convenient. \u00a0Wish they could do something like that again. \u00a0Maybe take over the McDonald's spot in the Union food court. \u00a0Honestly \u00a0- how could McDonald's not be successful there? \u00a0It seemed busy whenever I was there.", 
      "worked here, ate here. many many times.pizza is to die for. do not come during homecoming or mom/dads weekend, it will be packed.and they ship frozen cross country!", 
      "Best Pizza in central Illinois. To me it rivals the likes of Chicago's Giordano's. I get the deep dish sausage and don't look back. They also have $3 slices for lunch!", 
      "not the best pizza i've ever had, but easily the best deep dish you'll find within a 50 mile radius. sure the menu looks pricey, but i'm all about the deals. they have a pizza happy hour type deal, where single slices are half price (until they run out) from 3-4pm. that means $1.50 for a huge slice of sausage. WOWZA. ask for extra pizza sauce when they bring out your order. i'm a carb lover, but the crust is even too much bread for me.for appetizers... the soft bread sticks are my fave. warning, they're HUGE. gotta go with the nacho cheese and pizza sauce to accompany it.", 
      "Had Papa Del's this past weekend for the first time since graduating in May 2011. Service was great and pizza was hot and delicious (perfect for the cold, blistery Midwestern weekend when I was there). Can't wait to stop by again in April! :)", 
      "I visited Champaign, IL, recently for a quick weekend stay, and this restaurant was always the first suggestion made when I asked, \"where should we go for lunch.\" It wasn't crowded at lunch time so my girlfriends and I could sit and relax. We ordered their specialty deep dish pizza. It. was. huge. We ordered \u00a0a large and I think each one of the four of us at one piece. It was good but next time I will try the thin crust. If you are looking for an appetizer - try the meatballs. They were fantastic!", 
      "I had to come up to C-Urb alot for work for a year, but I loved this place, made sure to come here once or twice each visit. \u00a0The pizza was so freaking great, and it had cheap beer... \u00a0Yum!", 
      "My favorite pizza in CU by a million years. \u00a0Sauce is savory, so much cheese. \u00a0The last time I had Papa Del's pizza I broke three forks.", 
      "Papa Dels singlehandedly raised my expectations for what ridiculously good pizza should taste like. I remember when I used to think Pizza Hut was actually edible.... Thankfully I discovered Papa Dels deep-dish and have never looked back! This is no doubt the best pizza in Champaign-Urbana, and it definitely holds its own against the more famous Chicago deep-dish pizza places.", 
      "I have been eating Papa Del's since about 1975 and a friend and I ate one pie every night for three months so we could fill enough pizza cards to take our crew to dinner free. Since leaving Illinois I have made detours of many miles just for this pizza and to prove to others how good it is.. The best dinner ever and not a Chicago Style pizza, It's made with real dough, not buttery pie dough..", 
      "The deep dish was the best. \u00a0Make sure you order an entire pie, \u00a0they take about 40 minutes so allow you self some time but it's worth the wait. \u00a0If you order by the slice it's premade and not quite as special but by the slice is pretty awesome as well.", 
      "Slightly overrated, but pretty good stuff. The food and beer is expensive for the C-U. Better than Giordanos. Get there early and be prepared to wait b/c it is popular and can get very crowded, especially on fridays.", 
      "Best pizza in chambana. \u00a0It isn't really for a college life though as it takes a while to make the pizza and its not cheap. \u00a0I recommend the pan as its a more healthy version of the deep dish (or at least I tell myself that).", 
      "A delicious pizza that always leaves you with tons of leftovers and a very full stomach. In the summertime you can come for a lunch special and enjoy the patio. Parking is a BEAR, with a lot of spots you could get towed from. And don't think it's cheap -- you pay for the yummy goodness! But once you're in, sat and eating ... you fall in love all over again."

      "I have taken thin crust lovers and even vegetarians here and all agree that it is some of the best pizza they have ever had. \u00a0I particularly like the italian sausage. \u00a0If it is your first time there, be aware that you won't get your pizza until about 45 minutes after you order and its not cheap. \u00a0Just be prepared to inhale it when you get it.", 
      "The best pizza on the planet. \u00a0Seriously.", 
      "Great pizza. \u00a0Especially since you're stuck 3 hours from Chicago, if you're near this place. \u00a0=)", 
      "I haven't had pizza this great in a long time. I came here with a 3 others and we all got a small pizza for ourselves. It took about 45 minutes for the pizza to arrive but it was well worth the wait. Their thick pizza is in a class of it's own. The service was also very good, our server prepared our food to go for us when we were done and was very nice. I would definitely go back!", 
      "People kept saying we needed to try Papa Del's. We went and had a medium \"superstuffed\" with pepperoni and sausage. It came out a few minutes early and was cooked well. However, the pizza itself was nothing special, and certainly not the best pizza I'd ever had even in Champaign (Amano's does a better deep-dish, at least). Lots of cheese, but they were light on the toppings and there was way too much empty crust.Good place to go with a group and hang out, it's pretty noisy later at night.", 
      "I am not a huge pizza fan until my fiance' brought me here to eat after a U of I football game. This is the best pizza I have ever eaten and the veggies are fresh and not over done. The crust is homemade. I now crave Pizza as long as it comes from Papa Del's!", 
      "Simply the best pizza in CU. I grew up in the Chicago area and consider myself a pizza snob. This is definitely on par with Giordano's or Gino East, two very well know Chicagoland Pizzerias. I highly recommend all of their pizza, especially their deep dish.", 
      "Good deep dish pizza, a little bit on the pricey side but well worth it. It takes a while to get a deep dish side, I recommend ordering ahead of time before getting there.", 
      "Pizza was ok -- the crust was nice and buttery, but the sauce was a bit sweet and under-seasoned.", 
      "deep dish pizza done right. \u00a0close enough to chicago to get the real thing.", 
      "Only one word: Breadsticks.This is the best place to get pizza in Champaign. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The pizzas are huge, and seriously large men cannot eat more than maybe 2 slices of the deep dish. \u00a0Being from the Chicago area, this is basically the closest you will get in Champaign to Chicago Style Pizza.It's a beautiful thing.", 
      "During every trip to Champaign, I feel obligated to have Papa Del's at least once. \u00a0Sure, it's not quite \"proper\" Chicago pizza, but it's pretty close, and it's also what I grew up with. \u00a0Living on the west coast, I wish we had something this good.", 
      "The best pizza in town?? This place was pretty pedestrian, and I am hoping it isn't this best in town. Our pizza was good. We got a thin crust pizza with peppers and ham or something like that. Maybe our problem was getting thin crust. I am looking forward to going back here to try the Sicilian style or Chicago style pizzas. What I am not impressed with is the limited toppings. How can people get excited about this place when they only offer about 10 toppings. I am used to more than double that.", 
      "After about two slices your stomach is going to be tapped, but you'll still reach for a third slice. Be careful; over-eating here is commonplace. This is really good Chicago-style pizza, especially being so far away from Chicago. Has a crisp crust, soft/gooey/melty cheese, flavorful sauce, tender meat... Definitely the place to get your pizza fix.", 
      "Picked up Ben and Brandon at tennis camp so had to stop here. \u00a0Plus you can get slices at lunch! \u00a0Giant breadsticks that are great also. \u00a0Pizza takes time if you order a whole pie - 45 minutes for a thick crust, but worth the wait.", 
      "Thin crust pizza here is good. I am not from Chicago, so I'm not into deep dish pizza in general. Compared to other deep dish, I think this pizza is ok at best. Too pricey given the quality. Look elsewhere for affordable pizza that isn't a chain.", 
      "While I don't quite call Papa Del's Chicago-style, more of like Chicago-style, it's still really good. \u00a0(Yes, I'm picking nits ;). \u00a0They really are the best pizza in C-U.", 
      "Gross. \u00a0We ordered a pizza, and were told it would be 40 minutes. Ok, no problem. At 50 minutes I asked the waitress if it was coming out soon. \"5 minutes.\" Ok. 10 minutes went by, then another 10. We are now at an hour and 10 minutes, and still no pizza. \u00a0Another 10 minutes later-- now exactly twice what we were told-- she brings out a piping hot pizza with green peppers and mushrooms. Pity that we ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza... \u00a0We were so hungry that we said forget it, we'll eat this one. Then we tried to cut into it. The bottom was rock hard, and burnt to a crisp. The knives could not cut through it. And in the center of the pizza, you ask? Yep--cold as ice. WTF?!We called the waitress over, told her we'd pay for the drinks, but wanted to send the pizza back. 2 minutes later the owner is at our table, screaming at us that we are paying for the g-- d--- pizza. After attempting to calmly explain the situation, he said he didn't give a shit about that, he was getting his money. So I said, \"ok, sure, no problem. You go get the check.\" And we left while he went to get the check.Then-- oh yes, there's more-- about 2 weeks later there is a knock at the door of my mom's house, although I no longer lived there. She phoned me and said, \"Um... the police are here about a pizza you didn't pay for?\" What a dick! (The waitress had known me in high school and knew my name). I told my mom not to pay, and that I'd deal with it, but of course she was just worried about me and paid it. So the asshole got his money for a pizza we didn't order or eat, and that I would not have fed to my dog. And I have never been back.", 
      "Had to carry out pizza because the place was too crowded. The pizza took about an hour to make, but it was worth it. Best pizza in the area that I've had so far.", 
      "Papa Dell's serves the best Classic Chicago deep dish pizza in the area. It is a minimum of 45 minutes for a deep dish pie to cook but, it is sooo worth the wait. Order one with sausage you can't go wrong.", 
      "Papa Del's is great pizza. Simple. It's a little expensive to eat all the time, but a lot of fun for groups or when family comes to visit.It also reheats very well, so don't be afraid to order a little extra.", 
      "As a proud Alum of UIUC one of my favorite things about school was Papa Del's, sounds weird right? It evokes fond memories of me and my buddies scraping together money to get a PD's delivered to Scott Hall freshman year, and Weston my sophomore year. And forget about it when parents were in town, 22 XL's please. Great pizza, perfect college atmosphere, highly highly recommend.", 
      "So Papa Del's is an institution, yada yada. \u00a0And it really probably is the best pizza in town---if you know you're coming for a heavy, Chicago style pizza experience. \u00a0The thick crust is classic Chicago style and is excellent, while the thin crust isn't really that thin but is also quite good. \u00a0I usually go with their thin crust, knowing it isn't like a New York Style or anything but is instead a less bready version of their excellent deep dish offering. \u00a0Their sausage topping, in particular, is always worth getting.That said, I'm not sure I recommend eating in. \u00a0They are often crowded, their service can be *very* slow. \u00a0Get takeout instead. \u00a0Also, their parking lot looks like a giant bomb went off in it. \u00a0Watch your car!",

I Miss Coming To Green St Haveing A Deep Dish & Listening To Fame On The Jukebox. \u00a0No One I Mean No One Can Make A Pizza As Great As Yours, Thanks Jim Stamm", 
      "Well let me start off with- Overrated, overrated, overrated-Every time i'm in this place I wonder why I come. I feel like magically the pizza is going to get better and time and time again i'm disappointed. The place is dirty, the service is dopey...and I don't think there are enough sugar packets to keep the tables from tipping. The pizza is blah....not that i'm a huge fan of Chicago deep dish, but Giordano's, Lou Malnati's does it way better and that isn't even my favorite chicago pizza place (Pequods by the way). When you're standing there looking like a lost orphan and notice that there are several other individuals that look to be in the same state waiting, waiting, waiting....for what??? I've become much less tolerant as of late on waiting, customer service is my pet peeve and if you can't be on time with my order (within reason) then you don't deserve my business...your time is not worth more than mine. I'd prefer to go to Amanos, better pizza by far and very nice people that appreciate your business. No, I do not have any connection with the shop....I wish...but i'd prob be 50 lb heavier-", 
      "Tried this place again since I live so close to it and I am never going back. I grew up in Chicago and this is NOT authentic Chicago deep dish. The pizza is 80% dough and tastes bland and disgusting. Frozen microwave Connie's Pizzas from County Market taste more authentic than this crap.", 
      "I went to grad school at UIUC in the late '70s, left for a job on the east coast in 1980, and haven't been back since. \u00a0In the intervening 30 years I've eaten close to 1000 pizzas by my reckoning, all over the country but mostly in the metro NYC area -- and NYC has some pretty good pizza. \u00a0But in that vast landscape of tomato pies, the only one that really stands out -- by which I mean the only one I sometimes crave with particularity; the only one I can vividly recall the appearance, aroma, and flavor of; and the only one that moves me with nostalgia -- is Papa Del's deep-dish sausage pizza. It's a typical Chicago-style pie, baked in a heavily oiled, round, black steel pan. The crust is thick, bready, and slightly sweet. It doesn't just line the bottom, but extends up the side of the pan to contain the filling like a tart shell. This makes for a very high crust-to-filling ratio. The cheese -- at least a half-pound of a mozzarella blend in a \"small\" pie -- goes on the bottom, to prevent the crust from becoming soggy I guess. The sausage -- another half-pound, highly seasoned with fennel and garlic -- goes on next. It's raw when they put it in the oven, so all the fat oozes out as it bakes, mixing with the crushed tomatoes that cover the pie on top to form a delicious, meaty tasting sauce. I forget whether additions like mushrooms or onions go on top of or underneath the tomatoes -- underneath I think. \u00a0But one doesn't really care about the vegetables -- it's all about the cheese, the sausage, and the tomatoes. Best ... pizza ... ever! (as Comic Book Guy would say). Oh, and the lasagna dinner (with meat sauce) isn't bad either, if you're not in the mood for pizza.", 
      "Pizza takes forever, but it's deep dish so you should expect that. \u00a0 Desserts are okay.", 
      "Dang good pizza. But all the lactaid in the world can't help me if I go for slice number two of that deep dish madness. Makes me ripe as all get out but worth spending the night at home. The closest you can get to Chicago Style awesomeness. \u00a0LOVE.", 
      "Good deep-dish pizza, but the beer tends to be pretty skunky. Maybe we're just there on bottom-of-the-keg nights, but it's unpleasant to try to wash down delicious cheesy goodness with flat beer that tastes like greasy plastic tubing.", 
      "i had heard about this place for the last couple yrs from my brother and my cowkrs who are UI alum. \u00a0i had heard that the pizza is even better than some places in chicago. \u00a0those are some big shoes to fill. \u00a0of course, since i was coming out for my brother's graduation, and i love pizza, this was the first place i wanted to go when i arrived at champaign.for graduation wknd, this place was going to be packed, of course, so we ordered pizza for pickup on friday night. \u00a0we called at 6:10 and was told that it was going to be an hour and a half...wow! \u00a0we went to pick it up around 730. \u00a0around that time, a huge thunderstorm came and it also started hailing. \u00a0we ran into the restaurant, waited a few minutes for our pizza, grabbed it, and ran out into the pouring rain and hail to the car. \u00a0on our drive back, the roads started flooding (what is this weird place???), and it took a while to get home, as many cars were stuck in the flood. \u00a0we finally made it, and the pizza was delicious. \u00a0we got the super stuffed w/ sausage, spinach, and mushrooms. \u00a0the large was gigantic, and i only had 1 slice and was full. \u00a0the pizza would have been better if we ate at the restaurant, straight out of the oven, but it was still good. \u00a0we were going to re-bake it again to crisp it up, but after our wild ride back, we decided to eat it right out of the box. the best way to reheat a slice is to put it straight on a frying pan after heating it in the oven a bit.", 
      "On the rare occasions when I go back to Champaign, there are a few places I always need to revisit - the first, obviously, is Dos Reales. \u00a0The second is Papa Del's. \u00a0Everybody seems to love Papa Del's, and for good reason. \u00a0Champaign is not exactly a hotbed of amazing cuisine, but Papa Del's delivers consistently delicious, hot, cheesy deep-dish awesomeness. \u00a0There's usually a line, but even on Friday night of homecoming weekend we only waited 30 minutes! \u00a0And they had us pre-order our pizza when we put our name in for a table, so by the time we sat down, we only waited about 15 minutes before the pizza arrived. \u00a0The beer is dirt cheap (the one thing that makes me want to consider living in a small town), and the pizza really hits the spot. \u00a0I'm not a pizza snob by any means - all I know is when I cut that first slice, and the cheese stretches out in delicious strands, and the crust is crispy....I'm a happy girl. \u00a0See you next homecoming!",

      "just had the deep dish pizza, for the 1st time...let's just say that chicago's pizza it is NOT! it's decent, but nothing i'll be anxious to get back to...i think what was most disappointing is the lack of meat toppings - they only have pork sausage, pepperoni, bacon, or anchovies...what's up with that?? so we ordered the bacon, to-go...when we opened the box, after arriving back at our hotel, we saw it was raw!! no really, RAW!! not a good look!! my mom only took ONE bite & was done...my daughter & i just picked off the pork (as it was squealing :) & had a cheese pizza...that wasn't so bad...so, IF i ever eat this pizza again, i will only order the cheese....also, paid $16.95 for a medium pizza...had about 6 decent-sized slices.",

      "If you want good pizza in Champaign, Papa Del's is the place to go. Their Sicilian Pan pizza is some of the best I have ever had. They also have half price slices everyday from 3-4 p.m. Can't beat a deal like that!", 
      "I went there with my family after the High School state championship games. After waiting to be seated we ordered our pizzas because the waitress advised that they take a while. About a half-hour later she brings the first of the two we ordered. She then tells us I have some bad news that may be good news. She tells us she gave our second pizza to the wrong table however if we still want it the other table only ate a couple of pieces and we can have it for 50% off!I thought she was kidding but she was completely serious. I told her that was pretty gross and that we wanted a fresh pizza. She puts the order in and 45 minutes later the pizza still wasn't at our table although most of the people eating had left. Finally it came 50 minutes after she reordered. I asked to speak to the manager. The waitress came back and said the manager was busy and would only come out if we really wanted to talk to him but he would give us a discount.I told her I wanted to talk to him. A few minutes later a kid comes out of the kitchen wearing gloves and holding a spatula. I told him what happened and how long we waited and he said sorry. That was it. I told him about our waitress offering a partially eaten pizza and he said he talked to her about that. I am pretty sure she got someone from the kitchen to come out and not the manager. Long story short they took $5 off after we spent 2 hours in the restaurant. I will never go backObservations:The restaurant is dirty and needs a good cleaning The whole restaurant is dated and the finishes are worn out. The wait staff is clueless, obviously because nobody manages them.The only reason the restaurant is still going is because there is no real competition.Trust me go somewhere else where they want your business and maybe they clean once in a while..", 
      "Amazing. Delicious. I eat way too much of it! They have Shiner Bock on tap, which is another plus. Yes, it's a wait, so go with a group of friends and order some pitchers while you wait. Or get take-out or delivery if you don't have time to be social. But don't miss the goodness.", 
      "Having not eaten at Papa Del's since around 1975, I can't judge the current food and service. But I can tell you that 35 years ago the pizza then was the best and the service the worst. So I guess some things never change. . . .", 
      "Their pan pizza is very good, nothing special though. I guess I may be spoiled form Lou Malnati."

      "My girlfriends and I come in every other Tuesday night for Trivia Tuesday! (They do trivia every Tuesday at 7:00, and we all love Holly and Chris!) Great place to meet up with friends for drinks! It's very small and cozy. We don't usually order food because they serve free pizza for the night; however, we do order our fair share of drinks for the night :)They offer a good variety of mixed drinks, but their wine selection is pretty limited. Love this lounge!", 
      "A cool lounge with an enormous drink menu. \u00a0The one on their website doesn't even scratch the surface.I had something called a lime ku-ade and it was solid, if unremarkable. \u00a0I hit a home run with my second drink, a lemonade concoction that was equal parts boozy and smooth. \u00a0I expected to find it on their website, but it's not there.Our server was nice and prompt and had several recommendations for our group.Wasn't a fan of the layout. \u00a0It's just a long bar with a few booths. \u00a0Our booth faced the door to the kitchen, so the dark atmosphere was frequently punctured by the bright light of the kitchen. \u00a0That's a small drawback.If you're in this part of town, it's worth dropping in for a killer cocktail.", 
      "I really enjoy this place. It's low-key and upscale. Drinks are expensive but they're made on the strong side. The food is really go too. I've never had a dish I didn't enjoy. It's a great place to sit down and enjoy a cocktail and have a conversation. The crowd looks like 26 and up. \u00a0I consistently have a positive experience here.", 
      "My drink, pumpkin spice latte martini, was awesome. Husband's wine had gone bad & the spinach dip was not tasty at all. Don't go by the menu on Yelp. Current menu is tiny & not worth it. If you want hard liquor, this is the place. Otherwise, there are plenty of places within walking distance to get GREAT wine & AWESOME food.", 
      "You are a prominent bar in downtown Champaign. Why are you serving lousy chips out of a bag and bad salsa out of a jar?", 
      "A group of us have been coming to Champaign for our work to do some concentrated training 1-2x/month so we wanted to start checking out the local, non-college scene. We checked out Boltini twice, each time deciding on Wed. since it's their half-price-drink night.The first try was a few weeks ago and relatively early in the night I guess (9pm). We all, especially me, really liked the place itself; a loungey, chill vibe. I'm not a beer guy so I was very pleased with their great drink selections AND all 1/2 price! I thought this was a sure winner. It was kinda slow, and the main reason we left that time after only one drink was that the demographics threw us off. After some shifting during the 20mins. or so, there ended up being 5 couples there: all same-sex, 4 of the 5 were guys. Being new to the area, we didn't know if we found ourselves in a gay bar. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but it's just not conducive to keeping single straight guys around.This past week we came back because I was assured that it was a place open to all, so I talked the others into trying it again. On this, our second attempt (and third; we ended up coming back later), we got there around 10pm. It was later than the last time so I expected a bit more of a crowd. I guess that's my only complaint about this place. We gave it more of a chance, sticking around for just under an hour. It was worthwhile, but just not getting as active as we hoped. It did seem to start to shift as we were heading out, but he others had decided to move on.We ended up back there an hour later. The scene was about the same as when we were leaving; still just on the brink of happenin'. We stayed for about 45min, and I easily could have spent the rest of the night there but the others wanted to go back to the clubby place we closed at on our previous night.When we go back next week I think I WILL be sticking around if the vibe is right letting the others move on. I really want to love this place cuz it has all the right attributes for me (almost). Here's to hoping my next review will be 5 stars!", 
      "I love cocktails, and small plate restaurants, so I was very excited to try Boltini. I was unfortunately disappointed by the food. There was nothing wrong with the dishes per se, but there was definitely not anything remarkable. For the portions they were definitely not worth the price. The flavors tended to be fairly bland, and I was really not impressed. The presentation was well done, however. On another note, the martinis were great, and reasonably priced. I got a dirty martini, and substituted Stolichnaya for the Svedka, and it turned out really well. The waiter forgot to specify the vodka change on the second round, and while service was slow, the food came fast once the order was in. The experience was not unpleasant, but I doubt I'll be back. There are better places elsewhere in downtown Champaign.", 
      "Over priced vodka and gin drinks in martini glasses. I thought for the price you would get a really good martini but they didnt even make it correctly. \u00a0A little pretentious but the servers are nice, just too expensive for poorly made cocktails.", 
      "Imagine that you live in what is, for all intents and purposes, a farm town with pretensions due to a large university. \u00a0Imagine that students and faculty remember their snooty martini bars from back home. \u00a0Now imagine them building it in aforementioned farm town.Congratulations, you've found boltini, which shouldn't be as awesome as it is.While Boltini might not pass muster in San Francisco or L.A., it's amazing here, and the staff are friendly, accomodating, and the mood is light. \u00a0Spinning music, low lighting, amazing martinis, fantastic cheese platters--yeah, Boltini is a good life choice. I've enjoyed all my boltini visits, and marveled at the joys of pretentiously sippin' strong drinks in triangular glasses while glancing all about me. \u00a0Nicely done, Boltini.", 
      "So - stop me if you've heard this one - a Beer Girl walks into a Martini Bar...Ok, couldn't help myself. \u00a0So yes, Boltini is known for their martinis, but they have quite an awesome (and oft overlooked) beer list. \u00a0I got a Shipyard Pumpkin Ale - that stuff's hard to find in Chicago, so points to the C-U mini-metropolis on that one!For dinner, we went with the crab cake appetizer (as a Child of the Chesapeake, I am honor-bound to try any crab dish heralded as \"best in town\"). \u00a0I must say, this appetizer held its own. \u00a0While these were not traditional Chesapeake cakes, they took on a sort of Asian flair with the sauce and the vegetable pairings (I had no idea what to expect when I read that this came with \"Asian Slaw\". \u00a0What is that? \u00a0Eh, I'm still not sure, but it was delicious). \u00a0We definitely cleaned the plate.For my entree, I ordered the Blue Crab salad. \u00a0It was basically the appetizer salad-ified. \u00a0Without my asking, the dressing was on the side (gold star!).Overall, everything was fresh, tasty, and a touch unexpected (you never know when it comes to \"bar food\"). \u00a0While their drink menu far surpasses their dinner menu, Boltini is still a decent spot to grab a bite downtown.", 
      "This is a solid 4.5-5 star place. The prices may be higher than we all want to pay, but they are right for the value delivered. The servers are as good or better than any other bar in CU that comes to mind (and, for better or worse, I drink nearly everywhere).The place where Boltini really stands apart (for me) are their martinis and mixed drinks. If you order a dirty martini, for example, but specify that you want it only a little dirty they'll get it just right. Their Old Fashioned is quite a production. I forget what all Robb (mgr) put in it, but it was delightful. My absolute favorite mixed drink at Boltini is their Sugar Plum. It sounds pretty froofy, and it is indeed delightfully delish, but this straight arrow stands behind this very strong and very purple (tasting) beverage. I am not sure if the fact that I order mine without sugar on the rim of the glass makes my Sugar Plum swilling any less emasculating, but I do want that fact noted for the record.Lastly, Boltini's hosts 'Tuesday Night Trivia', starting every Tuesday night at 7pm. It is a lot of fun and all you have to do is come with a friend or two or 4 (I think 5 is the max, but it may be 6) and let them know your team name. At this trivia night, as opposed to Canopy Club's, which takes place at the exact same time, team names are punny, but not perverse. The host(s) pass out answer sheets for you to fill in and ask several rounds of questions over the PA. Dont be afraid to ask questions if you are curious. Competition is fun, and the whole thing lasts about 2-2.5 hours. Winners get prizes, including free drinks, appetizers, and even massages. The crowd is good: think professionals, teachers, librarians, grad students and profs. I don't go regularly anymore because it is just a 'lil too dear and also a 'lil to slow. Canopy Club's questions come faster. NTN trivia at BW3's is faster still.Park behind Boltini's in the lot.", 
      "The bar here isn't really my scene. I'm not a fan of house music or their prententious bartenders. I do like the food though and you can actually enjoy a good early dinner or late lunch at Boltini before the bar crowd saunters in and it gets loud. My favorite is the \"adult\" grilled cheeses because the cheese they use is amazing. Smoked gouda and bacon alongside shots of vodka tomato soup? Heaven. However, the cheese plates themselves are less satisfying. I wish they had more cheese and fewer garnishes.", 
      "I can really only rate on drinks. Good bar staff that makes one feel comfy and good. They make a quality drink, and have a damn good pour going on. I'm not talking about a crazy large pour that is borderline theft, i'm talking a quality pour. I will check out some food one of these days. The tunes can be a bit busy sometimes. Good to see Boltini still doing it's thing.", 
      "This place is pretentious and snobby, but that's exactly it's appeal. It's just doesn't appeal to me. If you like laid back beer-bars like Esquire or Mike and Molly's, you'll be confronted with something entirely different at Boltini. If you're interested in paying a bit more for girly, froo-froo cocktails, food that looks like food only smaller, or an entirely different experience this is the place for you. My most memorable moment at Boltini: asking for a Blue Moon and being handed a bottle (it's on draft everywhere else), and nearly spitting it out when I was told it would cost $4.75! (UPDATE: Blue Moon's are $4.25, not $4.75). They also assigned a single waitress to a group of over 20. When the clearly over-worked waitress couldn't keep up with the groups demands for drinks, I went to bar, and was rudely told by the snobby bartender woman that she couldn't add my beer to my tab because I had started the tab with the waitress. Again, I feel this would be an easy request for any other downtown pub to fill; but Boltini staff are too good to add one number to another number. That being said, if you're interested in fancy cocktails and fancy food--and are willing to pay extra for it--you'll probably like this place. If you're not a cocktail drinker, then skip this place.UPDATE: Thanks to Robb for responding to my concerns. Like I said, it's not my taste, but many people seem to like it. I'd rather have a diverse downtown than have everything the same.", 
      "Kind of a dark place to be. \u00a0The building is long and skinny. \u00a0When we walked in we were not greeted in a friendly manner actually we were not greeted at all. We noticed there were reserved signs on all the tables that had daylight on them so we were directed to the back where they have creepy crescent shaped booths.They have daily specials and the special was $5 cosmos so we all ordered one. \u00a0It was really good and really strong! \u00a0One is all you need. \u00a0We also ordered the margherita pizza, artichoke dip & the fancy mac & cheese. \u00a0The pizza was good, the dip was fabulous and the mac & cheese was gross. I do not know why they called it fancy mac & cheese. \u00a0The noodles were too big and chewy and the cheese did not have any flavor. \u00a0It was bland and boring and sticky. \u00a0Nothing fancy about it all so that was misleading.The dip had some hotness to it and had good flavor and consistency. \u00a0None of the food came out hot. \u00a0The pizza cheese was luke warm at best so I think it was sitting in the kitchen waiting to be brought out for a while.Our waitress was really nice and very helpful with helping us select menu items.Would I go back? \u00a0Yes, I would go back and try something different and hopefully we could sit somewhere towards the front and the light of day. \u00a0This place is really dark.", 
      "Update: \u00a0I recently had the WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD AT A BAR at Boltini. \u00a0I have never been as insulted by a waiter in my life as I was last night, when our waiter threw our checks at us and then went to the trouble of getting cash out of the register to RETURN OUR TIP, also throwing it at us, even though we paid with credit card. \u00a0Not only was this guy completely out of line, when I began reciting this story to friends later in the night \"We almost got in a fight with our waiter...\" everyone I told it to knew which waiter I was talking about from previous experience. \u00a0I won't be going back to Boltini for a while, and it gets demoted to 2 stars. \u00a0That kind of treatment is unacceptable.I think Boltini is my favorite bar in CU since it is essentially the only one that does not pander to Illini sports and skeezy undergrad men trying to get 18 year old sorority girls drunk, but it's hard to get my friends to go there because they think this makes it \"pretentious\" and \"snobby,\" preferring to get barfed upon at Mike and Molly's or wherever. \u00a0Personally I do not think it is pretentious, and I tend to think that the staff are only snobby when the patrons are acting like they are at a kegger and not like normal human beings trying to enjoy a non-Keystone Beverage. \u00a0Notably, when I first visited Boltini on a grad school visit whileI was living in Boston, I was SHOCKED at how cheap the drinks were. \u00a0I did not expect such low prices from such a well-appointed bar.I would EXPECT Boltini to have the best cocktails of any place downtown but I think that award , bizzarely, goes instead to Guido's. \u00a0The other factor contributing to the four star rating is the terrible, omnipresent, cigar-doused in ammonia smell that is even detectable out on the patio. \u00a0Perhaps this will improve when Champaign becomes smoke-free.", 
      "4.5I went to Boltini for dinner twice, and the food was good! We ordered a ton of appetizers and they were all good. My two favorites were the artichoke dip and the ahi tuna wonton (but again, I like everything with ahi tuna). The sandwiches were also really good too. We also got all their desserts (they had like 3 to choose from), and I loved the creme brulees. Best of all, the price was surprisingly cheap!The drinks were mostly good. Their beer of the month was good and cheap at $3. Other than that, their drinks fall in the $6-9 range which is a little steep for a town like Champaign. However, they make their drinks really strong, so you kinda have to pace yourself through the drinks.Overall, I like this place a lot. Great ambient, great food, great drinks, reasonable price. It's quite a rarity in Champaign.4 stars if you want to go there for drinks5 stars if you want to go there for dinner (because it's a bargain for the quality of food you get, especially when you have a gift certificate from restaurant.com).", 
      "I really, really loved this place. \u00a0Fantastic ambiance, fantastic martinis, fantastic service, fantastic food. \u00a0I love the variety of martinis here, which you don't see often at this level, and I especially love the dirty martinis (the Bloody Hot and Dirty). \u00a0Appetizers are fantastic to share, especially the pub pretzel fondue and \"Euro Crostini.\" \u00a0This all leads me to the only reason I knocked this place down to four stars: My girlfriend got the pub pretzel fondue for me as takeout one day, and the dip was just dumped into the cardboard container with the pretzel, where it inevitably began to seep through. \u00a0Why a place that is usually as top-notch as Boltini would just dump a sauce into a cardboard container, I don't know.", 
      "HELLO, new favorite place in Champaign.We decided as a family to go here for dinner on a recent visit. My brother is newly 21, so why not go somewhere with an amazing looking drink menu as well as an amazing looking menu?We got there relatively early on a Saturday, roughly 645pm. There were only a few individuals when we got there. We started the night with drinks, continued the night with drinks, and ended the night with drinks. Oh, and maybe some food. We each had martinis to start and were fairly pleased. Then I stumbled upon this gem of a mojito - strawberry basil. There were no mint mojitos due to the seasonality of mint - I love when restaurants acknowledge this fact. However, strawberries are in season, and made the most delicious drink. Maybe this is why I had 3.Oh, yeah, there's food. Do yourself a favor and order a cheese plate. A lot of the cheeses are from local farms and DELICIOUS. I continued the cheese parade with the Mac and Cheese. Cheddar and strong blue cheese? YUM. By the time we left (about 9:45pm - we take our time!) this place was PACKED, and much louder.Maybe since I'm used to paying Chicago prices for drinks, I found this place to be very reasonable. My mojitos were $8. We spent $95 on drinks, $50 on food, and were stuffed and well \"hydrated\" and very pleased. \u00a0Very pleasant service, although as Boltini got busier, we saw our waitress less (she was also doubling as a bartender). I will be back, Boltini.", 
      "Classy bar hidden in a small town.Came here during the weekday, we ordered a hummus plate, the fancy mac n cheese, 2 bottles of veuve cliquot and a some mixed drinks and shots. Everything was great and the staff are a group of really chill and fun people. I definitely recommend this place, especially if you're a student at uiuc and want to get away from the frat bars on campus.", 
      "The first time I came to boltini, I knew it wasn't my scene.. the thumpin music, the extensive cocktail list, the prices! This past Friday has changed my mind. I went out with the ladies, and was a few drinks in by the time we got to boltini. I had the strawberry gimlet, which was a homemade mixture of strawberry puree and vodka, topped off with a healthy pour of chambord ($7.25). I don't usually like paying this much for a cocktail but you really do get what you pay for! The drink did not taste of sugar or artificial strawberries... it tasted fresh and was absolutely fantastic! Also, the drinks are strong. They really aren't messing around. All of the employees were nice and accommodating too! I might not bring the boy for a quiet night out, but for me and my girls, boltini is a nice treat :)", 
      "I love Boltini! \u00a0It's such a great place to sit and chat and have a glass of wine. \u00a0I've been here a couple times and I will say that going in warmer weather is so much better because of their nice patio. \u00a0The inside is nice, too, but can get incredibly loud after 10ish on the weekends and cancels my original statement of being able to have a nice conversation. \u00a0However, before the music gets turned way up and it gets packed with college students, the inside has a really great ambiance.I've only tasted a few small bites on the menu, but they seem to have a really great offering, including desserts. \u00a0I'd recommend Boltini for a date night or a night out with the girls.", 
      "Favorite place to go out for drinks in Champaign! Fun atmosphere and great wait staff. Wednesday and Thursday half price martinis!!", 
      "I was in town for a short period of time and this place came highly recommended. I was told it had 'an extensive martini menu,' so of course I had to go!The vibe here was interesting. You could tell it was one of the posher places in town, but it felt like one part dive bar and one part lounge. I must admit I liked the music. They were playing Jamie Cullum as I entered the place.I tried the Pomegranate Martini. It was okay. It was pretty sweet for a martini... but I felt pretty buzzed afterwards. So I'm sure it had a decent amount of alcohol in it.The bathroom was quite nice, though. I would go back and try the food next time. It had several things I would have wanted to try had I not eaten earlier.", 
      "First, the good: The food was absolutely amazing. I had the rare tuna sandwich and it was far and away the best sandwich I've had. Also, I had the \"Fancy Mac&Cheese\" (I think that's what it's called) and it was phenomenal. I talked to the manager for a while about the menu and he was very friendly and helpful, and they served free samples of Maker's Mark. Also, my wine was fantastic, but I credit the wine more than the restaurant. EDIT: The bad: Originally I had posted a rather harsh review of the service, but in retrospect I think they were just understaffed/overworked due to trivia night. It's sort of an odd shaped restaurant, and I understand it's easy to lose a table in the shuffle. However, I still need to knock them down a star for it (but knocking them down 4 stars was way too much). I really appreciated the manager commenting on my original review, and it made me warm up to the place a lot. I'll come back on a different day, and hopefully that will let me give this place 5 stars. The food really was fantastic, worthy of 5 stars. Hopefully it was just an \"off night\" due to trivia when I went in.", 
      "Even back home in the San Francisco Bay Area, it's hard to find a lounge where good drinks, small crowds, great ambiance, and plenty of good seating mesh.The seating at Boltinis is comfortable and intimate. Think black leather semi-circle booths with high backs in the middle of the room. Towards the back of the room are black leather rectangular IKEA couches with glass tables and candlelight everywhere.The drinks are large, mixed well, strong, and tasty. Personally, I prefer a perfect (half dry, half sweet vermouth) gin martini, shaken.You CANNOT go wrong with the cheese plates here. Make sure to come at least in a group of four so you can order the 3 cheese plate. You choose from a cheese list and it is brought out with sliced baguettes (toasted and non-toasted), fruit (green apple slices, grapes), and olives. I would highly recommend the gueyere, euro cream, and the cheese infused with port wine. But seriously, pick and choose to your hearts content because the pairing of great cheese with great drinks will make you feel reallll sexy.I exposed my friends for the first time to Boltinis last weekend and they were highly impressed with the classy setting, quick servers, and amazing cheese and drinks. Even on a hectic Saturday night, we found a nice seating area in the back of the pit for all 8 of us.Boltini Lounge is a place that should stay hidden (thank God it's in dtown Champaign and not on campus) for its adventurous, sick-of-underage-teenybopper-gangsta-wannabes, discriminating clientele. I tell my friends that Boltini Lounge is where the people sick of the same scene at Joe's, Fubar, or even SoMa turn to.We will be there again tomorrow night for a birthday :)EDIT:Only downside is that they don't serve wine... So unfortunately you can't bring your own bottle of nice wine to enjoy here. But I guess you're supposed to be here for the martinis right?", 
      "This place may get 4 stars after a future visit. \u00a0But for now, it stands at just okay.So, you go in for the first time ever, and there's a huge list of fancy schmancy cocktails for your perusal. \u00a0You read through it, and are interrupted no fewer than 3 times by impatient bartenders. \u00a0You try to be polite, but dammit, they are really all up in your shit. \u00a0I appreciate the effort to be efficient, but it was so obnoxious. \u00a0I finally order my relatively overpriced elitist martini drink, and the very unfriendly lady bartender goes off to make it. \u00a0It was not particularly good. \u00a0It was all grapefruit and very little liquor. \u00a0In fact, it looked like a cosmo, because it was so laden with grapefruit juice. \u00a0Later on, someone else in my party ordered what I had, because it sounded good. \u00a0Hers came ruby red in color, because it had more liquor than juice. \u00a0It completed my theory that Bitchy McWaitress had a thing against me for looking through the menu. \u00a0But whatever.The perks to this bar: Lots of seating, nice & helpful waitstaff if you're seated away from the bar, insanely excellent gin gimlet (I mean, really, really awesome) served in a martini glass which was an unexpectedly classy touch, and great cheese plates.I'll probably be back.", 
      "Jelly donut shots, ooooo! O_O Ah-mazing. Dips were delicious, we got the basil pesto and the tomato one. They have a huge selection of shots and other drinks (I'm a shots person, get the job done with as little pain and time involved ;-))The ambiance is nice, and if you have a group of 5 or more and can snag some couches/chairs in the back I can guarantee you'll be there a while. It's so comfy and cozy. A wonderful place to go with friends.", 
      "I love that I come into this place, order a couple of the oh-so-tasty drinks, and get tanked. You get your money's worth here. The waitstaff is always nice and helpful, and the seating is comfy. It's a rarity to not find a spot for a small group of people. Plus you're guaranteed to see some hilariously drunk girls falling out of their tiny dresses. Always entertaining.My only problem with the place is that the music gets a little loud sometimes.If you're craving cocktails, this is THE place to go. The atmosphere is classy but not overly so, and there's always a good mix of people hanging out. If you know of any place comparable to it in Chicago, let me know!", 
      "The place looks posh.. but the people that work there and go there are a little weird. \u00a0In the winter, the place is small so you might have to wait in line and stand when you get inside (because there aren't any tables or chairs available). \u00a0Oh.. and sometimes the people are rude there.. but not often. \u00a0So that's why they get four stars.I do think they serve the best martinis in town. \u00a0I like the lemon drop and appletini.", 
      "In the middle of February when the snow decides to attack us, my friend decides to go to Boltini for a birthday dinner. \u00a0I didn't even know this place had a dinner menu since all their drinks have the spotlight, but it's not too bad, depending on what you get. \u00a0For a cold night like this, a selection from their 'hot drinks' looks perfect to warm you up, and someone ordered a 'Peppermint Patty.' \u00a0A bunch of others got their $4 specials of Razzmo's and Clementine Cosmo's. \u00a0I just stuck with water.But back the the food. \u00a0It is cheaper than most of their drinks! \u00a0Pastas started at $6.50 and sandwiches were up to $10. \u00a0The Liar's Club Sandwich caught my eye because of the raw ahi tuna, avacado, and sriracha aioli sauce. \u00a0Everything was tucked inside of a soft sun-dried tomato bun cushioned with a bed of sprouts. \u00a0They could have spiced the tuna a bit more, and added some more sriracha. \u00a0I was searching for more flavor with each bite and before I knew it the sandwich was gone.It was easy to eat because the softness of the sandwich, but needed a stronger punch ... and maybe some crunch. \u00a0My friend had to add hot pepper flakes to everything. \u00a0I'd say get the pizza or pesto pasta if you want something that is guaranteed to be good. \u00a0Their ahi tuna tacos and \"grown up grilled cheese\" looked interesting. \u00a0They have something called the 'Brownie Tower' which is self-explained heaven and served with a shot of chocolate milk.The ambiance is alright, they have cool names for everything and an endless list of classy drinks. \u00a0However it's funny I felt like the menu was trying to assure me that eating here made me \"grown up.\" Hence the \"grown up\" grilled cheese or a \"grown up\" shot of chocolate milk. \u00a0It's a creative twist to kiddish foods but thanks for the reminder. \u00a0A word of advice, order the things that are listed the most on the menu. \u00a0The 10 pages of drinks and 5 pages of cheese were no accident.", 
      "The chic decor, dim lights, and cozy booths set the intimate mood at Boltini Lounge. There are also additional seating areas in the back to accommodate larger groups but, especially during busier hours, I think that smaller groups work best. I love the menu's variety of selection to choose from. My personal favorites include the crab cakes, liar's club (the sriracha sauce is absolutely delish), meat-a-balls, and grilled cheese that you can dip into shots of the yummiest tomato vodka soup! The drinks are a little pricey, but are always really good and stiff; you'll get your money's worth.The male servers during my first two visits to Boltini were exceptional. They were knowledgeable, hospitable, and professional. During my last visit, however, we had a female server and although she was polite, she was very curt and seemed impatient for us to quickly order, eat, and pay as if it were a full house (in reality, we were one of only two tables during that early dinner hour). \u00a0Overall, I would recommend Boltini. The prices are reasonable and the food is pretty great. If the good service was more consistent across the staff, I would be more keen to give Boltini a straight 5 stars.", 
      "I love the atmosphere in Boltini - it's an amazing place to just relax and have a few drinks with friends over some food. Inside is dimly lit with strategically placed candles and intriguing local artwork hung throughout. Intimate booths up front for a date night and plush couches in the back for larger groups - I'm a fan of both. Drinks are priced relatively high for Champaign-Urbana standards at around $7-10 a cocktail, but they are made strong and well so it's worth it in my opinion. Food there is alright - I'm trying hard to remember it but failing ... which means it must not have been that spectacular.Summary: Go to Boltini if you want to get away and relax in an intimate setting. Not if you wanna get wasted and start dancing on the tables. Go to Joe's or Murphy's for that.", 
      "This is an excellent place to have an adult beverage. Until the Blind Pig reopened it had the best beer in town - small selection, but CHOICE. This is where I learned the love of Three Floyd's Alpha King. The decor is cool, the round booths are cool, the clientele thinks it is cooler than it really is, but that's the case almost everywhere. I just wish it were open in the afternoons! Always my favorite time to hit a bar, when it's deserted, quiet, and smoke-free.", 
      "It's a bit expensive and often crowded, and the booze can be low-quality (they recently switched from Beefeater to New Amsterdam as their well gin). Now that that's out of the way, the praise:Oh man, is the decor great. This place has wonderful ambiance, with great service and fantastic staff. The food's only okay (I liked the chicken quesadila but not a lot), but it's pretty cheap and, honestly, you don't come to Boltini for the food. You come for the cocktails. The martinis are great, and if you don't like vodka martinis, there are plenty of great drinks on the menu (personally, I get dirty martinis and Old Fashioned when I don't want to drink sugary stuff). The bar is gorgeous, and they almost always have some sort of music, whether it's a live DJ or a guy and a keyboard (okay, that's not always the best sort of thing). The specials are also fantastic; Wednesdays feature half-price cocktails, and Thursdays feature half price martinis. While I wish they'd tell me what qualifies as a \"martini,\" I'm not going to complain. $15 can get you three really good drinks and a very strong buzz.", 
      "There are tons of bars in downtown Champaign and this place is fortunate enough for me to have walked into it! Met up a couple of friends here for a drink and ehh it was alright. My mojito was too sour and the leaves are grinded up pretty good so you can sip up a herb and not even know it. I sipped an herb and chewed on it by accident and YACKCKK!! My friend's martini was too strong for her so she asked to have it re-mixed, the waiter said he was too busy but questioned her for 3 minutes about her drink saying he couldn't do it, and wadda-ya-know, he did it! He was friendly overall, however, but saying one thing and then the truth comes out is a slight pet-peeve for me.Environment was nice; music really cranked up at 10 on the dot. Good place to chill and have a few drinks, what i really liked were the prices. They were very moderate and not overpriced. I would come back again but next time i'll pre-drink so I can babysit another mojito that i don't enjoy. :).P.S. I received a follow up message; this goes to show that this restaurant really shows effort to tend to the comforts of the customers. Great service!", 
      "Nice, dark late-night atmosphere. It was a little hard to find a table (the place was packed), and we had to seat ourselves (boo). Food was great. We shared a mushroom/goat cheese crostini appetizer. The mushrooms and cheese were sort of creamed together, which I wasn't happy with at first, but liked it once I tasted it. I had the lobster bisque, which was a special, and it was a nice price (I think $5 for a nicely sized bowl). The drinks will kick your ass... in a good way. Our waiter was SO FUN. Only downside is that we were checked on a little too often, and weren't really given enough privacy to chow down.", 
      "HH declared his drink one of the best martinis of his life. \u00a0Grilled dates wrapped in bacon to die for. \u00a0Nice find in Champaign.", 
      "Small plates. Big cheese.Had a wonderful date night at Boltini. Decided on a three course culinary adventure. Started by sharing a huge bowl of Roasted Red Pepper & Smoked Gouda soup. Towards the bottom of the bowl, it started to get spicy. The spice was nicely counterbalanced by bits of bacon.Next, we shared a generous cheese plate with baguettes and fresh fruits. We chose three cheeses that would not be incorporated into other portions of our meal. Porter Cheese, Goat Cheese, and Bacon-Encrusted Brie. The Brie was excellent. It might be related to my obsession with bacon. I will tell you that somehow I passed on ordering their 12 perfectly cooked pieces of bacon appetizer.Finally, we ordered three small plates. Mushroom crostinis, crab cakes and bacon-wrapped blue affine stuffed dates. Crab cakes had a tropical feel because of a light slaw with fruit incorporated. The dates were delicious but heavy and rich. The portion included six dates. That would be great for six people as one was enough.Great night with great service. However, we got the feeling that we needed to initially command the attention of a server. The restaurant's tables are first come first serve and that chaotic feeling carried over into getting a server's attention that we were at the restaurant to eat and not just drink. If you aren't assertive, you may find it hard to get a table and to get service.", 
      "Tomato soup with vodka and grilled cheese? Yes please!Awesome cheese plates? Thank you!Stiff-ass cocktails (made correctly)? For sure.Excellent service.Great bar."

      "Around 9:49 PM: \"Whoops. I was craving Thai, not whatever this \"crispy pad thai\" situation is. It's a pile of wafers. How is this a \"noodle\"? So disappointed.The crab rangoon is good. I guess it'll be my lunch/dinner for the day/night. Somehow the four wontons don't seem to suffice; but close to nothing is better than a pile of cold wafers.\"9:58 PM: I called to complain that it's under the \"noodles\" section, and whoever answered said, \"Yes. That's crispy pad thai.\" Uhh.. That's great; it's not a noodle dish though. Now I have a 10$ plate of cold wafers.10:15 PM: *Edit from one star to four*\"Okay fine. Pouring the sauce on the cold wafers makes the wafer/chip situation 'better.' Still disappointed. Still think it should be under a different category. Also, I spilled the sauce on my leg. Not Siam terrace's fault, but I love complaining.\"", 
      "My first Thai experience and honestly it was more like a 3.5 stars.We ordered a Pad Thai with chicken and a Mussamun Beef Curry delivered. Delivery time was very fast and we used their convenient online ordering.My roommate really liked his Pad Thai and my Mussamun curry was decent as well, in terms of flavor. My only reservations about Siam Terrace is the price. Yes, you get very large portion of food, but to be honest I didn't think either dish was worth over $10. The meat quality, at least on the beef was not very good, as I'm beginning to see with all Asian restaurants down here. I don't get it, do they not want to purchase good beef?I think if the meat was higher quality it might be worth it, but the high price really turned me off.The flavor and authenticity of the dish was spot on, though. The exact taste was a really interesting combination of sweet, spicy and creaminess. I thought the curry was pretty liquid-y itself but maybe Thai curry is not the same as Indian curry? I'm not sure.3.5/5 for authenticity, quick delivery, portion size and just something unique.I will have to try something else!", 
      "I got take-out from Siam Terrace years ago and wasn't really impressed. \u00a0My wife and I got soup, a duck dish, and something else that I don't remember. \u00a0The duck dish still had a lot of gristle and bones in the duck pieces, and the soup wasn't that flavorful. \u00a0It felt kind of expensive for the amount and quality of food we got; we meant it as a treat meal, but it didn't really feel like one.It had, however, been a few years and it was a convenient spot for lunch. \u00a0Knowing that they had lunch specials, we decided to give it another try. \u00a0As you can guess from the number of stars, we won't be trying it again.The atmosphere/decor is fine - not especially distinctive, not going to really scare anyone off or impress them.The service was likewise fine, fairly attentive for the lunch rush.The food was disappointing. \u00a0The salads were iceberg lettuce served with a very firm tomato slice and sliced carrot. \u00a0The dressing didn't taste much like ginger - it was mostly sweet and very watery, so that there was a puddle left on the plate after finishing the salad itself. \u00a0I think I would rather not have had a salad, as opposed to having such a perfunctory one.For the main dish, I got the red curry and my wife got the pad thai. \u00a0The pad thai was really, really sweet. \u00a0The red curry was alright - despite being labeled as two peppers on the menu, it didn't have much heat. \u00a0I got it with chicken and there wasn't a huge amount of chicken in it.I really hate to say it, but I felt like some of the distinctive thai flavors - the spice and basil, for instance - were toned down or absent, creating a more Midwesternized version of the dishes.Portion sizes were alright - we both ended up taking some home to eat later. Basically, the food was okay. \u00a0However, the price for the two lunch specials + 2 iced teas + one thai tea (also incredibly sweet, but it's supposed to be) was about $22 with tax. \u00a0For that price, I found myself wishing we'd gone somewhere else and I can't say that anything else on the menu made me want to return.", 
      "This place is strange. The fried rice has no egg and big tomato chunks The Pad see u had American broccoli florets It seems they want to be Thai restaurant, but don't seek out authentic ingredients. While the service was decent, the prices reasonable and the atmosphere standard, the food was a disappointment both in taste and presentation.", 
      "I was looking to get some Thai food takeout last Saturday and found Siam Terrace had a moderately priced menu and good online reviews so I thought I would try it out. I ordered from the \"House Specialty\" section of the Thai Cuisine menu and got the \"Ramrong with chicken\" (steamed broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, green beans, baby corn, celery and Napa cabbage topped with \"special peanut sauce\").The order was ready very quickly (5-10 minutes after I ordered) which was a plus, but the food was very, very disappointing. Basically it was a to go container filled with boiled vegetables and chicken. The chicken was thin, gray, and unseasoned and the vegetables were also completely devoid of flavor. The only somewhat redeeming part of the dish was the \"special peanut sauce\" that was a tiny portion compared to the amount of rice and vegetables given. The peanut sauce reminded of the Woody Allen quote in Annie Hall, \"The food at this place is terrible.\" \"Ya, and such small portions.\"I digress...All of this being said, I don't know if I will ever order takeout from Siam Terrace again. However, walking inside the restaurant to pickup my order I did see what some of the guests were eating and it looked much better than my sad plate of Ramrong.", 
      "Went here on a Saturday evening. It wasn't too full, but had a good number of people in it. Between the four of us, we ordered, the Lava Trio, Pad Thai, Thai beef noodle soup (Thai pho) with a crab rangoon on the side, and a vegetarian tofu stir fry. We also ordered three rolls of sushi Atmosphere (2/5)Not fancy, very casual, chill. Like most Champaign Asian restaurants, a little dingy. There is a small outdoor seating section, and some nice natural light near the front with the windows.Food (3/10)Let me start with the good. The crab rangoon was good. I mistakenly ordered it after reading the reviews for the My Thai crab rangoon, but I was pleasantly surprised because I enjoyed it. The Lava Trio was also decent. Not the freshest seafood (alright not fresh at all), but it was tasty albeit expensive. That is all that was good about this place. The Pad Thai and vegetable stir were both \u00a0too salty and too sweet. The beef noodle soup was basically salted basil water, with a heaping serving of oil. On top of that, our server decided not to bring out thesushi until well after we were finished eating the rest of the food despite asking for the sushi first. When the sushi finally came out, one of the rolls, called the White Bear, came with very little scallop in the roll, and on top of that, my dad who orders the roll regularly, commented on how it was the worst White Bear he has ever had. The Volcano was some kind of crab cake on top of a basic California roll. The Bangkok roll, which I ordered after reading various reviews, was a heap load of good ingredients thrown together into one mess of a roll. That one I picked apart and ate the pieces individually. Not bad.Service (2/5)Our server seemed nice enough, but unfamiliar with the menu. When I asked for opinions about her favorite dishes, she barely had any opinions because she barely had touched the food. At least she was honest. However, When we complained about the White Bear being subpar, she gave us a dirty questioning look, apologized, and offered free desert as compensation, which unfortunately, we did not try because we were full. Value (2/5)The food was not that good. Ok it was pretty bad. And also not cheap. Our billcame to over 100 for four people. Three of us did not enjoy our meal. Overall the whole experience breaks down like so: Atmosphere: 2/5 (Dingy with some decent natural lighting near the windows.)Service: 2/5 (Server gave us dirty looks when we complained about the White Bear.)Value: 1/5 (Small portions + bad food = sad wallet.)Food: 3/10 (Parts of the meal were edible but not much was enjoyable.)Overall: 8/25 - Would have to pull teeth to make me go back. Try at your own risk. Maybe you will have better luck.", 
      "Though their menu might appear pricey especially for dinner, the dishes are completely worth it. Try the Panang salmon with asparagus, the Heaven duck curry, the Pad Thai, or any of their red/green/yellow curry dishes. If you're vegetarian try the mock duck curry. For soups, tom kha gai is yum. They also serve smaller portions at lunch. For dessert, try their seasonal Sticky rice with mango - while I've never been a fan of mangoes in the US, this restaurant knows how to pick their mangoes! For drink, try the Thai iced coffee/tea.Service is always wonderful. They also have wines and liquors, but c'mon who drinks wine with Thai food? :)Just don't try their sushi.", 
      "One of the best Thai restaurants in Urbana! The Pad Thai was delicious, but it is just a little of the pricey side for normal college students.", 
      "I definitely feel that the their strongest items are the fried rice dishes. The pad thai is way too sweet and the sushi is average at best.", 
      "I have never had a terrible experience at Siam Terrace thus far. Their Thai dishes are delicious, some more than others. I like their fried rice and really enjoy their salad. The prices aren't bad and the portions are good. I also tried their sushi before and it was pretty good. However, the last time I visited they told us that they weren't serving sushi at the time. Not sure why or if they have a specific time for it but that was somewhat disappointing. So call ahead if you want sushi! Still, I like Siam. I feel like it's one of the few good Thai places around Chambana. Definitely worth a try.", 
      "I order the shrimp salad for delivery and it was very tasty. However I paid $11 for 5 pieces of shrimp and three pieces of greens...seasoning was great but I was expecting a much bigger portion. On the plus side, delivery took only about 15 mins.", 
      "My favorite Pad See Ewe and the best thai in Champaign Urbana. Their yellow curry is a second favorite and their sushi is always very fresh.", 
      "I love Thai food. LOVE it. I didn't love anything about the foods I tried today. The salad, maybe - that was interesting and very tasty. When I saw onion dressing on the menu and it came out looking simply as grated onion over the lettuce, I wasn't expecting much. It was a pleasant surprise. I would definitely order the salad again. Our table shared the mussels, a spider roll, chicken satay, and lava chicken. The mussels were MASSIVE! I was expecting them to come in a bowl cooked in sauce as I'm used to, but these are served on a plate with a dish of cold sauce to dip them in. The sauce is a vinaigrette that was supposed to have some heat, but I didn't notice any. The spider roll was exactly what I'm used to. Very small wasabi/ginger portions! The chicken satay was a-ok. I've had amazing, this doesn't compare. The peanut sauce really helped, though. The lava chicken had no heat at all. It looked tasty but was actually very bland. The service was very good and very friendly!", 
      "I'm Thai. I grew up eating Thai food. I've worked at a couple of Thai restaurants. I know a good Thai restaurant when I see one.My favorites: Pad See Ew, Prig Khing stirfry, Lava Trio, and Bangkok roll (it's a fancy sushi roll).The price is pretty good for what you get. The service is consistently good, and the ambient is probably better than most Thai restaurants in town (love the red tin ceiling!).", 
      "Wow! \u00a0I will certainly be coming back! \u00a0(And I will edit this review as fits.)I'm new in town and hadn't heard of this place, but my date had been here once before and enjoyed it. \u00a0We went on a Monday evening. \u00a0It's a small restaurant and I've heard people complain about how it is decorated and kept, but I really liked it. \u00a0It was clean and neat and small inside, though it is in a strip of bars and other neon-lighted windows. \u00a0If you think you're in the wrong place, you might not be. \u00a0Once you get inside, however, it's decorated like your classic Thai restaurant. \u00a0We got the summer rolls as an appetizer and that was the beginning of the *yum* experience. \u00a0Very fresh veggies in a light wrapping, dipped in a spiced peanut sauce. \u00a0I didn't think it could get any tastier until I got my dish, a house curry with tofu. \u00a0I forget the exact name of it now--I'll edit this later for it. \u00a0The first one on the curry menu, though; it's really worth trying. \u00a0I got a 3.5/4 spicy rating (yes, I did ask for the .5, thank you very much ;-)). \u00a0I like how they have this scale, to be honest. \u00a0Anyways, delicious! \u00a0Perfectly spiced, not just in a hot way, but in a everything-is-done-right-down-to-the-last-grain-\u00adof-spice perfect. \u00a0I don't even know how to describe it aside from that. \u00a0The tofu was cooked perfectly, as well.We washed it down with oolong tea, from bags, but this wasn't sad enough to keep this place from five stars. \u00a0If you know my ratings, you know that means that this place was INCREDIBLE.The service was also excellent; we had two young ladies as our waitresses because one was training and the other, teaching. \u00a0Unlike many trainees, our waitress was very professional even though it was apparent that she was new. \u00a0The waitresses were very attentive and the service overall was very fast, but did not give up any quality for the speed.Anyways, this place is a must try!Oh yeah, if you try and Google map this, you get real Siam, over in Thailand. \u00a0Just a warning. \u00a0Thanks, Google.", 
      "Really nicely done!The perfect amount of chili pepper heat, and served steaming hot. I will definitely try them again.", 
      "Decent Thai food in downtown Urbana. I went there for dinner on a Friday night, and the place was almost packed. The menu is very extensive, and carry most typical Thai dishes. I ordered a cup of Tom Kha Gai, which was delicious and which I highly recommend (btw the cup is more a bowl than a cup, and is plenty for one person). For my entree, I got the spicy fried catfish, which was also quite good: fried catfish filet stir-fried in a spicy sauce and topped with crispy basil leaves. The portion was very large and it was tasty, but I wish it had come with some vegetables.The service was prompt and efficient and pretty friendly (but what is up with bringing the check before I'm done eating?). I'll probably be back. \u00a03-1/2 stars.", 
      "I *really* enjoyed my dining experience at Siam Terrace. \u00a0Well, lunching experience, I suppose I should say. \u00a0They had awesome lunch specials ($6-8 per entree, with a side salad starter). \u00a0I tried their Red Curry with tofu, 2-star spicy. \u00a0It was a little bit weak for 2-stars, but not so much so that I was actually disappointed. \u00a0It was positively loaded with tofu and vegetables, which pleased me greatly. \u00a0The serving size was more than ample for the price. \u00a0I left, fat and happy.The waitstaff was on top of their game, except for forgetting to give me utensils until I asked for them. \u00a0But this request was met by an embarrassed apology and prompt service. \u00a0The food came out quickly, considering the restaurant was not exactly devoid of customers. \u00a0The waitress was very pleasant. \u00a0What's not to love?", 
      "We went there after reading the review and we were not disappointed . The food was spicy and delicious.We ordered for expert spicy soup ,green curry and red curry. \u00a0Its not a big place but worth visiting for thai food.", 
      "It serves decent Thai food... but food is really a hit or miss here. \u00a0It used to be better. \u00a0The service is a little lacking here. \u00a0I have waited 10 minutes before I could get a refill on my water. \u00a0And everytime I have gone, they have increased the tip on my credit card to their liking. \u00a0(I have gone to the credit card company and have reported them numerous times.. but it's just dissapointing they do that.)If you like pad thai or curry.. I'd go to Golden Wok on University instead. \u00a0Bigger portions and more delicious. \u00a0If you want to try other things, this wouldn't be a bad place to go.", 
      "Big fan. Big, big fan.Frankly, it's pretty difficult to screw up Pad Thai, let's face it. I will eat Thai food anywhere, but Siam Terrace is the best in town. Apart from the fact that they deliver (I think the ONLY Thai restaurant who do), they have the best egg rolls in town, the best appetizer list, and literally everything is wonderful on the menu. The restaurant isn't perfect in terms of decor, but it is in a really cool old building. The service is generally great, the delivery is quick, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.", 
      "So many people told me that this is the best place in town to get Thai food, and I was sorely disappointed, especially since I took my mom here.The panang curry and thai basic rice were not memorable. The pad thai was bland, and the lad nar was way too salty. We also ordered the mixed appetizer plate that came with bland chicken eggrolls and spring rolls entirely filled with lettuce for which the sauce could not compensate for taste. \u00a0Add the strange ambiance involving Top 40 hits in the background and you have an establishment that far from impressed me. The worse thing was I found this restaurant to be expensive for the area.Maybe their business lays in their sushi.", 
      "Waiting in line for seating on a Friday night is not only a sign of a quality restaurant, it's practically a necessity. Although, we waiting in front of a guy who complained loudly of the high prices on the take-out.But it was all worth it. I had the chicken fried rice and wouldn't change a thing except the portion sizes...they were huge. And my group got served in under fifteen minutes despite all tables being filled to capacity. Impressive.", 
      "Upgrade after actually going inside. \u00a0I really enjoy places serving both Thai and Japanese food. \u00a0It's the wave of the future. \u00a0The next chicken-n-waffles.Liked that the decor here wasn't too over the top. \u00a0Fake flowers were the only off note. \u00a0Warmly painted walls; artwork that doesn't hurt your eyeballs.Service good, friendly and fast. \u00a0They actually seemed to care how we liked the food.Sushi here was solid; there were some inventive rolls. \u00a0Everything sushi prepared at an open style counter towards the back.To me one mark of good a Thai joint is the tom kah. \u00a0It's fairly amazing in the flavor department here. \u00a0Loved it- but for the mushrooms; not straw like would've expected, just regular plain old button mushrooms. \u00a0It was the only off flavor in the soup.Red curry was nice. \u00a0A three on the spicy level was perfect, but next time I'd ask for three and a half. \u00a0The salad dressing on our tiny side salads was so good both myself and dining companion drank the last left in our bowls.Oh, and the best part: forty bucks got both of us enough food for 2-3 meals.", 
      "Siam Terrace is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Urbana. It's also memorably one of the few restaurants I have a favorite dish at just because they make a red curry so well. Don't let that detract you from choosing something else on the menu though. The rad nar, pad thai, and other options are all excellent choices. I'm just particular I guess.It's not quite five stars just because sometimes it does feel a little cramped if you have four or more people (and the proximity of the tables feels a tad off), but I'd have to say it's more than four. Appetizers are alright, it's hard to go wrong with basic fare although the shrimp appetizer is quite good and I heartily recommend it.While I put it at $$ it's more like $ and a half. Prices are very reasonable, with my favorite red curry starting at $8.99 or so for the vegetarian, chicken, or tofu options, and a bit higher for meat entrees (usually no more than $12 in the case of seafood).", 
      "Siam Terrace is probably second for Thai food in CU. And even then it's pretty close. Both restaurants have their particular strengths so part of it depends on what you're in the mood for. The staff is very friendly although sometimes a little slow if it gets busy. I think they have the best pad thai in town. To me it has the perfect blend of sweetness, nutiness and spice complimented by the fresh bite of the cilantro and crunch of sprouts and shredded carrot. It's sweeter than your typical pad thai but it's very well balanced overall.Their appetizers are nicely priced and I have enjoyed all of them that I tried. I would not recommend the Thom Kha soup here. It's a bit too sweet and lacks some of the depth of other versions of this soup I've had. It's not bad by any means, but it wasn't what I was looking for in that soup. Be bold with spice here. It can vary, but I find that they tend to be a bit more gentle with the spice overall.A big plus for Siam Terrace is its selection of sushi. It's decently priced for the most part and everything I've had is tasty. I'd definitely recommend their Bakery sushi. It's moderately priced and is battered and served with some excellent eel sauce. Be careful when you first get it though as it's VERY hot.For a drink, I recommend trying the coconut juice or Thai Iced Tea. Both are refreshing and a great, sweet compliment to the spicier dishes.", 
      "Good food. Good service. Decent atmosphere. Worth trying. Sushi is the way to go, but the portions of the thai entrees are solid too.", 
      "Sam is one of the best Thai food I had. Their curries tastes decent with a subtle taste of fresh herbs. I attempted to make curry but mine never come close to what they offer. Never tried their sushi though.", 
      "The best part of eating at Siam Terrace is the historic Knights of Pythias Building in which it is located. \u00a0Tin ceilings, 16 feet high, add to the drama. \u00a0And the owner and his family are great folks.We had an all sushi/sashimi dinner and the boat presentation was a work of art.The miso soup is perfectly prepared.", 
      "I really enjoy coming to this restaurant. \u00a0The food is generally delicious, they have a great selection of appetizers, and it's not too expensive. \u00a0I usually order a curry, which always comes out deliciously fantastic, and I have a love affair with the eggplant tempura. \u00a0Buuuut the last time I dined there I switched it up with a Mock Duck with Basil. \u00a0This dish sounded totally delicious, and just to emphasize with the waitress what I wanted, I made sure the dish was 100% vegan before proceeding. \u00a0That being said, I was hugely disappointed when, instead of mock duck with basil, I got duck with basil. \u00a0This is after having the waitress double-check that the order was vegan, and me saying \"MOCK duck\" several times as she took my order. \u00a0So there I was, a lowly vegan in a usually veg-friendly place, with a huge slab of dead meat in front of me. \u00a0This upset me far more than I could convey; when they finally brought out the \"real\" mock (somewhat ironic, I know) duck, it was great. \u00a0It may seem like an innocent screw-up back in the kitchen, but as someone who has devoted the rest of their life to help end the suffering of animals, I was no happy camper. \u00a0For this reason, I can't give it more than 3 stars.Go here, you'll have a good meal, but be warned... the service is frequently slow, and your order might get really messed up...", 
      "They make the food really sweet. Their noodles is not very good but I think the curries are ok.", 
      "I simply can't explain my love for this restaurant (despite only having been here while passing through UC a couple times) as well as April-Hope does below. \u00a0I will explain, however, that I docked a star because I've had better Thai cuisine...but that was in Chicagoland.If you're looking for Thai in the U-C area, you can't pass this up.", 
      "SOLID.I have only been once but my pad see ew was delish! The noodles were cooked perfectly and I left full. My boyfriend is also a huge curry fan and he says that this place has probably the best in Champaign. We both love spicy food so this place was perfect! I'll be back!", 
      "This was my first Thai restaurant I've tried in Illinois since having been spoiled with excellent Thai food in California. I came to Siam Terrace after reading the reviews on yelp, and I have to say that I was not disappointed! My friend and I ordered the eggroll appetizer, the panang curry and the pad thai. All of which were very delicious! We ordered the sticky rice with mango, which was decent. And I ordered the Thai iced tea which was okay. I will definitely be going back here to get my Thai food fix!", 
      "I order from Siam Terrace every once in awhile. I find their Thai food to be a little on the sweet side but it's not bad at all. I love that they have sushi -- it's not bad especially if its delivered! Overall I'm not totally excited about Siam Terrace but I definitely would recommend it to any thai/sushi lovers.", 
      "Note: \u00a0I only get Pad See Ew at Thai restaurants....Decent Pad See Ew. \u00a0No complaints - if you ask for it spicy they make it HOT. \u00a0Be careful with that. \u00a0Service is always good, I'm a fan.", 
      "Their noodle dishes are tasty and really satisfying. They are also not too greasy which is wonderful. Also, try the crispy pad thai - it is AMAZING! I ordered it thinking it was noodles with crispy wontons mixed in which would be a nice texture contrast but it is actually just a huge pile of fried wonton skins. It was delicious even though the whole time I was eating it all I could think of was thisiswhyyourefat.com. It's a great dish to share though, I definitely recommend it. They also have sushi - it's nothing too special but still solid if you are craving sushi. They even deliver if you're lazy. Sweet!", 
      "I am going to review only one aspect of Siam Terrace, the sushi. I have eaten sushi all over the US, and Siam Terrace is as good as the best, if not the very best sushi I have ever had. OK, I'll review some more, very good pad Thai, great service, all around best Thai restaurant in town, but the sushi is simply the best anywhere.Update: We had some very good sushi in Ft. Lauderdale Florida recently, excellent nigiri. Last night, for Valentine's Day (eve) we ordered more sushi from Siam Terrace for take out. Siam Terrace is still the best ever, anywhere. I can't say enough about it, it is that good. \u00a0Simply the best.", 
      "I've been here a few times, and I like it. The service is quick, friendly, and attentive. The food is pretty good. My favorite dish so far is the pad see ew because it has a nice balance of protein, veggies, and noodles. I tried the pad thai once, and I can never get myself to order it again. It was edible, but it tasted different than any other pad thai I've had at other restaurants.", 
      "I love their pad thai I have tried diff places and this has def been my favorite. I order online it's quick and easy!!!"

      "I've only ordered one dish here, but I can't stray from it because it is so amazing.MOCK DUCK BASIL. Order it, eat it, love it. One of the best vegetarian dishes ever.", 
      "Siam is my favorite Thai restaurant in Urbana. I love their vegetarian options (even though I eat meat) - they make a mean mock duck and they are willing to substitute Seitan into just about any dish. I discovered the CRISPY pad thai about a year ago, and it's become my favorite dish (pad thai that's fried? what's not to love??).The very best part about this restaurant is the fact that they deliver to Urbana residents EAST of Vine st. My only complaint about this place is the variable service (esp since they don't take reservations). I've been here for both dinner and lunch on several occasions and I have to say depending on which server you get, the service is either great or horrendous. beware...", 
      "I like Siam Terrace, I do, and you can't go wrong with a pot of tom kha, but I really think the food at thara thai is better, and it's so much cheaper at thara thai I can't get worked up about siam terrace.If I lived in Urbana, I would probably still go here alot, but I don't live in Urbana, so I've only been here twice in 4 years.", 
      "One of CU's nicest Thai restaurants- great for takeout or dining in. I had the Bangkok Duck here and it was absolutely delicious- just the right blend of crispness and juiciness, with a wonderful sauce that paired perfectly with the rice. It was a little bit pricey, but worth it. I also tried the potstickers, which were quite nice (though I wish I had asked for them steamed), and the fried bananas, which were rich and sweet. Compared to Thara Thai this restaurant is a much less inclined towards the spicy and many dishes seem to have sweet ingredients like tamarind. However, many dishes can be made spicy...or vegetarian for that matter.Definitely recommended! I think anyone could find something to enjoy here.", 
      "Pretty good sushi considering it's chambana. My sister even tried a spicy tuna roll even though she \"doesn't\" like sushi. I could tell that she didn't appreciate the texture...she had that \"I'm gonna puke, but not because it tastes bad\" look. I think we all know what I'm talking about. Overall, a good night out. I'd return, but I'm guessing that I'll try something different next time since I don't visit the Alma mater that frequently.", 
      "As per my previous review, I used to like this place much better than my last few outings here. \u00a0My last three meals at this place have been nothing close to the 5 star rating I originally gave it. \u00a0Last time I went, my order came out wrong twice, finally being overly salted and dryed out. \u00a0The restaurant was also freezing inside... turn up your heater! The two times before that, the food was just bland, overcooked, and not appetizing at all. \u00a0This used to be my favorite thai restaurant, but something changed, and I don't even care to go here anymore. \u00a0Something changed, and it wasn't for the better!", 
      "This is my absolute favorite restaurant. You cannot find better Thai food this side of the Pacific. There is a great menu selection and everything can be made vegetarian. The spring rolls and sticky rice with mango are absolutely amazing. Good prices for the quality of the food- about $10 for a meal with appetizers. If you are looking for Champaign Urbana, I definitely recommend eating here!", 
      "I just had my first ever Siam Terrace carry out box lunch special, and I am really impressed. \u00a0 It's a shame they don't advertise it better, because it's a really great deal and very convenient.It's for carry out only, and $8.50 gets you an egg roll, salad, and your choice of Thai fried rice, Spicy fried rice, Pad See You, or Red Curry. You can get the entrees with either chicken or vegetable. That said, I got a Pad Thai with tofu and vegetables today and it only cost me an extra $2. They don't seem to be terribly picky about substitutions. The portions were smaller than if you eat in, but I was still stuffed. It comes in a really nice little partitioned tray that's sturdy enough to be reused (free tupperware - score!). They will also deliver if you order 2 or more of the boxed lunches.", 
      "Great service, no waiting and friendly staff. I love how spicy the food can be by request without losing the great thai flavor. I recommend the fried banana if you like a little crunch", 
      "It's the most consistently delicious food in Champaign-Urbana. Everything is good: the soups, the noodle dishes, the sushi, the curry, the fish, the duck, the deserts... it's all amazing. Their lunches are every bit as good as their dinners, only smaller and more inexpensive. A great value.", 
      "nothing to complain about with Siam Terrace, the lunch specials are excellent with my preference for the Lava Chicken. \u00a0My wife swears the beef pad thai is the best in champaign/urbana.This is about as good as you will find for thai anywhere.", 
      "I enjoy the food here but the atmosphere is kind of blah. Usually get the yellow curry or pad thai.", 
      "I went to Siam Terrace for dinner and after tasting every dish at the table I decided it's the best Thai I've had in CU thus far.Service was friendly and neither intrusive nor absent.", 
      "Good pad Thai. Great prices. Defiantly go to Thai place in CU for me.", 
      "I've been coming to Siam Terrace now for about a year and I have to say, they've upped their game, the service is better (fantastic even), and the food has never failed to impress. \u00a0So for all of you Thai-jonesin' folk, Siam is well worth a slot on your rotation. \u00a0Nice work :)", 
      "I went here w/ my vegetarian brother and had the fried eggplant appetizer (perfectly fried and not greasy), crispy mock duck w/ basil (surprisingly crispy with good meaty texture, but lacking in duck flavor for me), and tofu pad woon sen (good helping of vegetables but the tofu was overcooked and the noodles too dry). Overall I think the food's better than average. Maybe my standards for Thai food are too high b/c I lived in Evanston (the \"dining capital of the North Shore\") where there were at least 4 great Thai restaurants nearby. The service is prompt and friendly, though the ambiance does feel a bit warehousish. I've heard from many friends here that Siam Terrace is the best Thai place in Champaign Urbana...I'll vouch for that (w/o trying the other Thai places) and emphasize the qualifier \"best...in Champaign Urbana.\"", 
      "Went here is very good. I liked the food ramnook tofu was sweet and savory and on the lunch plate was only 7.50. I also had the 4 in 1 appetizer not worth the cost fish cakes, shrimp with noodles around it, crab rangoon, pot stickers with four different sauces. Two of which were sweet. Also, they dont have Siracha here so if you want it extra spicy you should ask. Recommend going there for lunch much cheaper.", 
      "We went here on a Sunday afternoon. \u00a0The restaurant is very nice and appealing. \u00a0The service is friendly and quick. \u00a0The food was delicious! \u00a0The portions were very nice for sharing, too. \u00a0My only suggestion for this restaurant would be to add traditional Thai fresh spring rolls to their appetizer menu.", 
      "Great place! I always enjoy going there. Once the food took super long, but every place messes up once. I love their noodle dishes and their curries. It is all good.", 
      "Best Thai food in the C-U area. On one occasion I asked for no onions on my rice and they sent it with onions so I called them back and they sent me a new one, no questions asked. I've also ordered seafood dishes from them multiple times and they're always fresh. Bottom line: excellent food, excellent customer service.", 
      "Short review - I ordered it level 4 spicy, it had not a hint of heat. Both noodle dishes I ordered, Pad Thai and Pad See You were kind of boring. I think it is a bit overpriced for what it is.", 
      "Jesus Christ founded Siam Terrace in 1992 when he could not find Thai Food on earth like God used to make.", 
      "Maybe I don't like Thai food (but I dont think that's it), but I have yet to eat here and be satisfied with the meal. \u00a0The quantity is enough. But after I pay $15 for a meal and the food is mediocre, it just leaves something to be desired. \u00a0I've tried several of the curries and soups. \u00a0The meals are satisfactory but not worth the price.", 
      "This place is good, I LOVE the mock duck dishes. \u00a0I have also had salmon, pad see ew, and pad thai here for entrees and veg dumplings for appetizers. \u00a0All of the food I have samples has tasted great, but I must agree with previous reviewers. \u00a0This joint is expensive. \u00a0I like to order delivery, and I understand that that ain't free. \u00a0But somehow, the price always seems to magically increase significantly compared to when I add the prices up myself. \u00a0The delivery is fast, the food is tasty, I feel it's a little over-priced.", 
      "This review is wayyy overdue so hopefully Siam Terrace is still the same as it was when I last visited. If you decide to come here, you can't leave without trying the crispy pad Thai. It's a nice change since the dish is made from wonton skins as opposed to noodles.", 
      "I found everything here to be bland. The Pad Thai with tofu was okay, but pretty bland. I tried the Spicy Seitan as well, and it was anything but spicy. Also very bland. The seitan tasted just ok and the vegetables that were listed on the menu weren't in the dish. Everything was edible, but just not that great. If I return to the U of I area I wouldn't come back.", 
      "Love, love LOVE Siam Terrace. It is the best thai food I've ever had including when I lived in Chicago and visited Thailand! Their mock duck basil is expensive but worth it! Pad thai is also very good and the food is consistently good which is also important. Their weekday lunch specials are a good deal and will fill you up.", 
      "We got the crab rangoon and spring rolls for an app and then split two of the veggie rice entrees...I think the seitan delight and veggie delight. \u00a0The crab was excellent, only complaint is that I wished there was more. \u00a0The spring rolls...not so hot. \u00a0I am used to shrimp and other veggies other than just lettuce and carrots. \u00a0The seitan and the veggie delight were both good, not excellent and we ordered them \"A R thai\" or something like that...I guess it means that it is the hottest. \u00a0Well, I wanted more SPICE! \u00a0Too bad we had it delivered and did not have access to the sauce. \u00a0Overall, not bad. \u00a0I also thought that the portion sizes were pretty small. \u00a0They brought them in the normal circle plastic things and they were like half full...I was disappointed in that. \u00a0Isnt getting asian take out known for leftovers for days....?", 
      "Pad see ew is really fantastic here. I got the pad thai initially and was not a fan at all. However, now that I found \"my dish\" I've been back a few times in the last couple of weeks.", 
      "Full agreement with the other posters - the food here is so very, very good. \u00a0As with most Thai restaurants, they are willing to make most things vegetarian by using tofu instead of meat, but they also have some dishes specifically made with tofu or mock duck (seitan) that are to die for. \u00a0Their mock duck with curry sauce... I lust after it.", 
      "We had two very satisfying lunches here. Both times I got the Pad See Ew. Asking for a spiciness of 1 out of 4 yielded a great sweet and salty blend. The atmosphere is just okay, but we had great service and delicious food - can't complain and would definitely return.", 
      "My fiance likes to come here because he adores the Lava Trio when he's feeling gluttonous. \u00a0The management and wait staff are all very lovely, but I personally am not a huge fan. \u00a0It's overpriced and located smack-dab in downtown Urbana. \u00a0The flavor tends to be overpowering or boring, so I prefer to stick with Thara Thai, located on Bloomington Road in Champaign.", 
      "Love this place. The green curry is my typical Thai go-to & at Siam it is the best I have had in years. When it is available, the spicy conch sushi is fantastic, too!", 
      "Other than the spiciness, I was very underwhelmed by their pad thai.The employee who took my order messed up twice while trying to take my order over the phone only to be told by a second employee that I can't place the order and receive the discount unless I do it online.", 
      "The thai food is ok. Not as good as basil thai in my opinion. Haven't had the chance to try their sushis yet though.", 
      "Something happened to this place ~2 years ago. It used to be, hands down, the best Thai in Chambana. Fresh, flavorful, etc. Then, a series of visits (at least 5) left me disappointed. I kept coming back because it's still probably the best in the area, but now that's not saying much. I hope they are back on the upswing.", 
      "I don't understand why everyone raves about this place. The first time my food wasn't that great, I blamed myself for not ordering the right dish. But, I have eaten from Siam Terrace many times now and my opinion is still the same. Even basic things like Pad-thai, Pad kee mao ended up not meeting my expectations. I don't think I would ever order from here again.", 
      "Probably the best Thai food I've ever had. \u00a0Definitely a cut above the also amazing Basil Thai Urbana but also a bit more expense (you also have to tip here because they actually have servers unlike basil thai). \u00a0Nice atmosphere too, it would be a good place to bring a date. \u00a0I would highly recommend their tom kha gai soup and their mock duck curry (it's made of seitan).", 
      "Good solid Thai food. \u00a0None of their food particular makes this place stick out from the other thai places in the area, but this is a good place for a consistently good food in a pretty convenient location for those in Urbana.",

      "Upon arrival, I was a little bit scared of the wait to get seated, since I came with a party of 15 people, and the place was PACKED. However, they definitely worked super fast and we got seated in less than 30 minutes. Being a big fan of American dining, I had always be using skillets as my control group to test the quality of the restaurant. Hearing only good things about this place, I had relatively high expectations. And long behold, this place does not disappoint.I first ordered a strawberry creme smoothie. It came in a chilled glass mug. Upon first sip, I could taste the strawberries. Not many restaurants can do that. Within a few minutes I decided to order the Blarney Skillet because I am always a sucker for corned beef. The food was served within 10-15 minutes. And Dear God, did the combination of both hit the spot! The skillet itself is not greasy, yet you feel like you are eating something substantial. The taste of the ingredients are further complemented by the hollandaise sauce, which was mixed with the two sunny-side-up eggs to perfect the combination. The waiter/waitresses were very attentive. They constantly swung by to ensure that we have enough water as my buddies and I just chatted after we finish our meals. They were super polite and gives great insight when asked to provide recommendations of items on the menu. The best part about this place is probably the price. The two items: smoothie and skillets, came to a combined total of approximately $12 including tax, which is not bad at all! I would highly recommend this place if you have a mean of transportation to get here!", 
      "Le Peep is a chain found all over the place, but it took a 16 hour road trip for me to try it in Urbana. \u00a0It's quite an alright breakfast place. \u00a0The omelettes are quite good, and it's pretty affordable - all in all a solid breakfast place. \u00a0If that's what you're looking for, then there's no reason why you shouldn't come here.", 
      "The price of their food is too high for the quality. I would rank this food on the same level as the pancake house but for more money. Also, there is nothing French about their omelettes. I haven't tried the crepes so i can't give my opinion.", 
      "The drifter skillet is phenomenal! \u00a0The skillet is filled with seasonal veggies, no grease, and the eggs are incredibly fresh. \u00a0Our waitress was phenomenal: \u00a0super friendly and attentive, yet not over-bearing at all. \u00a0I can't believe this establishment is a chain?! \u00a0My husband and I arrived around noon for brunch, this past Easter Sunday. \u00a0A great plan! \u00a0I'm wondering if they're BYO friendly. \u00a0I'd love some champagne in my OJ:)", 
      "The food is standard and what you'd expect from a breakfast place. It comes out pretty quickly too. Nothing I've had is really exceptional to make it stand out from other breakfast places. The atmosphere is casual but not greasy. Service is always good.They have\"lattes\" on their menu, but these are not made with espresso. I would have known if I had glanced over at their \"latte\" machine, the same kind gas stations have (I love gas station \"lattes\", but it wasn't what was expecting here.) If you want coffee, get regular bottomless coffee instead.", 
      "This is like the equivalent of Egg Harbor of the suburbs. A lot of flair, but nothing there!Anyways, I went on a Sunday morning. The service was great, the coffee was fantastic, and the wait was non existent. A good start to the meal!I usually get the 2 x 2 x 2 (pancakes, eggs, and breakfast meat), but with school starting tomorrow...I decided to do something different.I decided to order French Toast, the \"Le Petit\" option. It came with bacon (which they gave me sausage instead for some reason...crisis averted later, but I digress). With my bacon in tow, I also asked for some strawberries on top. I got two eggs scrambled on the side, too. So I guess I got the 2 x 2 x 2 just under a different moniker. Needless to say with the order mess up, I wasn't shocked to find that the food was \"Meh\". If you're in CU, stick to Original Pancake House or Cracker Barrel for eggs and oatmeal. I wish I went to one of them today instead!I also tried to \"check in\" here, but my phone didn't let me...come on Le Peep!Hey, I've got a secret. You can't say a peep to anyone you know who likes this place. There are better options around. I wish I tried Sam's Cafe today instead!", 
      "Came here after Original Pancake House was too packed, was craving for a delicious Sunday brunch and Le Peep definitely delivered. Got seated immediately and ordered a stuffed French toast (flavor of the day was chocolate chip). Great French toast, very filling and tasty. Also tried the garden omelette which was very light and also delicious. Unfortunately the coffee was sub par, but most diner coffees are. Overall, the service was great and food was good, and the comfortable, happy atmosphere of Le Peep definitely makes it worth visiting.", 
      "Decent breakfast food. I had some sausage and potato skillet smothered in gravy and topped with runny eggs. Yum but it was 95% potatoes. Coworker had something hollandaise and said it was average. Pancakes are average. Service is quick and friendly though. It's a good find for breakfast in this small town.",

      "Good but not great. Ordered the fruit cakes & they were totally uninspired.Not so many breakfast places in champaign so it is what it is.", 
      "I've never been here before, but one of my friends suggested this as the traditional last meal before the drive back to Ohio. \u00a0There was a 25 min wait which in my opinion was not bad. What breakfast brunch place doesn't have a wait on Sundays anyways. Once we were seated I gazed over the menu and became focused on the skillet items they had. Everything sounded tasty. I chose a sausage skillet plate that had gravy with a basted egg on top. It didn't disappoint. Upon delivery it was piping hot and visually pleasant. Each bite was good mmmm good. Definitely suggest this place for anyone in need of a good meal.", 
      "Their classic cubed potatoes are very very good. Their gypsy plate is fantastic. However, there are things to improve on that need attention.One time we went there, our waitress said that they \"don't take credits cards at the table\", which is total BULL because all the other waitresses that served us there did. It seemed that she didn't feel like doing her job, or that she felt \"superior\" to us.Another time, we learned through the manager that they carefully measure every portion of potatoes per plate...he said every plate \"only gets\" 8oz per serving. He wasn't so friendly and he cut us off while talking.Today I went and got their Seafood Crepes for $7.75. The dish says it is stuffed with seafood...A total LIE.It is ONLY stuffed with cheap *imitation* crab meat, wrapped with a couple layers of oily egg. Gross! If you don't know what imitation crab meat is, it's not real crab meat. You can get it under $4.00 at walmart!Looking at the plate, I immediately realized they were not using real seafood, so I told the waitress Patti about it. Thankfully she was human and decent about it and did not charge us for the plate, in light of how the plate description was *not honest*.We left and I am not sure I will be returning.", 
      "Visited Le Peep yesterday (5/2/2012). Both I and my guest experienced marvelous food. She had an homestead eggs Benedict and I had a standard ham and cheese omelette. \u00a0Pictures of both were taken and uploaded. Hers looked fantastic.My omelette was excellent. Light and fluffy. Melty \u00a0cheese that was great. And the ham was great. I tend to like my ham chunks to be more substantial... It didn't take anything away from the omelette at all.The servers were nice and we got a pair of them as one was in training. We were treated like royalty. No complaints.5 stars.", 
      "Le Peep is Mario from Super Mario Bros. 2. Mario is not as fast as Toad, doesn't jump as high as Luigi, and doesn't float in the air like Peach. That is why I never go back to Le Peep. Merry Ann's, Sam's Cafe, Pancake House and Courier Cafe are all better than Le Peep in one way or another, be it speed, price, quality, or selection. Le Peep is fine, especially for a chain, and offers an interesting variety of items for higher than average prices, but it ain't gonna wow you.", 
      "Mmmmmm. Had the Harvest-something-or-other(english muffin topped with cream cheese, fresh veggies and poached eggs--hold the hollandaise, please!) which was so great! Very fresh and tasty. Not to mention filling. Had a few bites of the accompanying potatoes, not my fave, but I was too full anyway. They had a wide variety of dishes, and many healthy options. My only complaint was the \"fresh squeezed\" orange juice. At \u00a0four bucks a pop for a large glass, I'm better off getting a half gallon at the Jenifer Street Market back home for double that price--and it's SO much better.", 
      "Nothing bad, nothing great. Breakfast, an omelet, was very average and the service was fair.Being a chain Le Peep is a know quantity and reliable. Reliable, as in average.", 
      "It's pretty good, I have to say. The skillets are unique and pretty tasty, and they have some nice lunch options. At least, it looks like they do, who comes to this place for lunch anyway!?However, if you're talking pancakes, there's only one spot you should be going and that's the Original Pancake House. Their sausage is also much better. But if you're into more unique kinds of breakfast foods, Le Peep might be just for you!", 
      "The service has always been fine, and they're actually super accomodating for big groups. I don't think the wait has ever been ridiculous when I've gone, but of course there's a wait on Saturdays and Sundays. That's when people go out for brunch!The Irish Benedict is amazing. Two toasted english muffins topped with corned beef hash, a poached egg and delicious hollandaise sauce? Can't beat it. My brunch motto is: everything with hollandaise sauce, hollandaise sauce with everything.Coffee is kept fresh and warm. A great place for breakfast or brunch in the Champaign-Urbana area!", 
      "If you're looking for something a little nicer than your typical ihop/Perkin's (yet still casual enough to go wearing just shorts and a t-shirt) , then I would suggest checking out Le Peep.They have a varied menu with something for everyone, it's clean and open inside, they have outdoor seating for when it's nice out, service was good, and it's cheap!My friend and I split a Nomad skillet and their Razzle Dazzle french toast (or something like that). \u00a0We were super hungry initially, but omg were we stuffed afterwards! \u00a0The Nomad was pretty good, but we agreed that the next time we came here, we would try something different. Same deal with the french toast. \u00a0Definitely a good brunch place for when you're really hungry!", 
      "Le Peep is a solid breakfast/brunch spot, especially for Champaign. \u00a0I'm spoiled now, living in brunch-crazed LA, but when I'm \"home\" my parents often want to take me to Le Peep as it's become their fave for b-fast.Their menu has a nice variety, but nothing too exciting. \u00a0This is central Illinois, after all. \u00a0The biggest difference between LA brunch and Champaign brunch? \u00a0Grease. \u00a0Those midwesterners LOVE their grease. \u00a0My parents are born and raised C-Uers, and I have to giggle when they talk about how healthy the food is at Le Peep. \u00a0True, it's an improvement on most of what you'll find in the area... and true, the world of scrambled tofu and turkey bacon is quite a different one, so not an altogether fair comparison... but it's still funny to me.", 
      "With the full restaurant and constant influx of people Saturday morning for breakfast, I expected this place to be a no doubter. Instead, what I got was uninspired, run-of-the-mill breakfast that failed to meet expectations. I got an omelette with chorizo, something that can't possibly be messed up, especially in the chorizo haven known as Champaign. They messed it up. The potatoes were soft and mushy, and even the toast seemed a bit off. To top it off, as soon as we got our meal, we were given our check. Nothing says \"get out of here so we can get more money\" quite like that. For your money and satisfaction, you're better off going to Urbana Garden or the like.", 
      "Not as good as the Indiana locations. \u00a0Service was a tad slow. \u00a0But breakfast is breakfast. \u00a0I was with four others, and we all ordered something different.", 
      "Better than IHOP by far. Basic good food. I had the ham melt without mushroom and tomato. That's just what I got. My husband got the Denver skillet ($7.50). I tried the potatoes in it and they were good. I had the raz ma taz smoothie and it was great. We had a coupon so it was worth the visit. They didn't get 5 stars because their online menu and their actual menu don't match.", 
      "Although the price of the food and service was great, the taste of the food was just okay. The menu was extensive but what I ordered was nothing special.", 
      "Best breakfast in C-U and reasonable price. Waits on weekend after maybe 9. Cheese eggs are great!", 
      "One of the better breakfast places in CU area (that we've found). Had a bit of a wait--went around 11am on a weekend. Flavored coffee was awesome. The French toast was above average. The skillet we ordered was good as well though we've had better (not in CU).", 
      "I think you're either a Le Peep groupie or you're not. I'm not. I'll go there, and their food is alright, but nothing special.", 
      "The food quality is not that great.", 
      "I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by Le Peep's brunch. The dining room is cramped and busy, but the service is friendly & efficient. We had some trouble deciding what to order off their never-ending menu (not a complaint!), and I was really happy with my granola blueberry pancakes. Sounds strange, but what a great idea to put granola in/on pancakes! I like that each table gets their own pitcher of water, coffee, hot water for your tea, whatever you happen to be drinking. I'd definitely return to Le Peep in the future.", 
      "This is a solid place and I don't understand why it's gotten such bad reviews! It's a lovely place for brunch... the garden egg white omelette was yummy and \u00a0the coffee acceptable. Overall, \u00a0i \u00a0like!", 
      "Decent food, but not breathtaking. Service was excellent, and prices were also very good. I'd consider coming back to try something else.", 
      "I used to frequent Le Peep. It's reliable food, but nothing great or special. The food doesn't have too much flavor to it, and if you get over that, it's decent.The last time I went, I only wanted to go because I had a free meal to redeem from the punch cards they have. Now, I had two different cards with punches that both added up to a full card. You would think that they could add those two cards together to redeem my meal. However, when I was at the stand to redeem the card, the host wouldn't let me because the punches were on two separate cards. She told me that she could combine all of the punches on one card for me so that I could come back the next time and redeem it. That was SO generous of her. When I grudgingly paid, the host also looked at the signature line of my credit card that said \"SEE ID.\" So, she asked me, \"Do you want me to look at your ID?\" I answered no. She asked the same question to the lady behind me that paid. I'm pretty sure that asking that question defeats the purpose of writing that in the signature line. I'm not one to even care if people check my ID, but phrasing a question like that just showed the ignorance of the employees at this restaurant.The servers have always been nice, it's just the hosts (and manager I believe) that were incredibly disappointing. I won't be returning.", 
      "Not bad for a chain. \u00a0The decor was very well done and the menu was expansive and well thought out. \u00a0Food was well prepared but a bit on the small side in terms of portions. \u00a0Wait staff was pretty good and friendly.", 
      "This is one of those places where I only go if someone else REALLY wants to go. i always get the same thing, a chicken melt with onions and peppers. I could make it better, but it's been reliable. I am not an egg person, so I guess I am missing out? Coffee is not good. Usually crowded, and service is passable.", 
      "Not too bad! \u00a0I've been largely disappointed in the breakfast/brunch options in town, but Le Peep did a decent (if not outstanding) Eggs Benedict and Biscuits and Gravy.", 
      "I had the gypsy skillet and I thought it was dry. The flavor was good for the most part. The onions were overwhelming and there were too many potatoes and not enough mushrooms. I also asked for my eggs to not be runny and they were. In a skillet that can be gross. I only gave them two stars because that is what I truly feel. I might change my mind when and if I go back again.", 
      "There aren't too many good brunch spots near campus, so I was happy to find Le Peep. Friendly service, good food, and fair prices. Their menu is huge and everyone I was with enjoyed their food. It's nothing to write home about, but if I lived in the area, I'd probably be a regular.", 
      "Food is awesome! French toast and peasant potatoes are delish!", 
      "Can't say I understand the scathing reviews either...I had heard good things about this place, so I did what any dutiful Yelper would: I looked the place up, read the reviews, and was convinced that my friends were all liars =P \u00a0Well, one emphatic endorsement from a classmate later, Helen and I grudgingly came here for Sunday breakfast...and were totally shocked to see how crowded it was at 10 am. \u00a0The place is clearly a local favorite, and the egg white omelette I had was perfectly serviceable. \u00a0Maybe August was a bad month, but at this rate I'll definitely be returning for my brunch fixes.", 
      "It may be a chain, but Le Peep recreates both the feel and service of a good small town diner. I almost went for the Hobo Breakfast just on the name alone, but settled for a skillet with bacon in the mix. Very good and served in portions too large for one breakfast."

      "Excellent service from our waiter...forgot his name..Grant? He was extremely polite and kept telling my group we had good questions which was pretty funny. He was also on top of bringing our bread and refilling our water. Food was delicious. I did not expect my seafood to be so big too. The amount and quality is worth the price, at least for the seafood pasta I got. The olive oil/pepper/cheese mix for our bread was very good! The only thing I wish for is the bread to be warmer when it is served to it. It was a little cold, if not plain temp. I will come again!", 
      "I have to downgrade my review after having two disappointing experiences at Biaggi's. We have been there on two occasions when the restaurant was extremely busy and crowded. I don't totally blame the server because it is very hard to keep up with that kind of pressure, but the service was terrible. Our orders got all screwed up-all of them-and we never got refills on our drinks. Food was just OK although a step up from Olive Garden (which isn't saying much.) I won't be back.", 
      "I had a great experience here. \u00a0The staff was friendly and did a great job as the group that I was in was very large (spread over two tables). \u00a0I had the roasted vegetable risotto and it was good. \u00a0Nice and creamy and the vegetables were cooked very well. The only negative thing about the risotto was that it was a little flat.", 
      "Nice Italian restaurant. Never have had any issues with service. Wait isn't usually long. Food is pretty good.", 
      "I again tried the CU location and the service is HORRIBLE!!!! \u00a0It had been 2 years so I thought I would give it another try. They got 1 speed...SLOW! \u00a0The last trip I called the manager. \u00a0Today I talked to the manager. \u00a0He could care less:(. Never going again which is too bad because the food is fine once you get to order and it eventually comes:(", 
      "GREAT Italian restaurant. Started in bloomington IL and has now spread throughout the midwest. I am yet to have a pasta dish that I didn't love. Their delicious homemade bread and oil/pepper/parmesan they put out on the tables before your entrees is reason enough to come. I would say its closest competitor/comparison would be Olive Garden, but you get a higher quality meal at a slightly lower price here.One great option is getting a half-portion (my dates here have always loved this) where you can get a half-portion of your favorite pasta for 8.99. And it is more than enough to fill up most ladies! I highly recommend Biaggi's for a date night or nice family dinner.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the noise. They have never done a great job of sound-proofing their restaurants and during peak hours it can get quite noisy.", 
      "Good enough in Champaign-Urbana.A lot of people are fans of their lobster fettucini although I generally don't trust seafood in the midwest (the only time i got this dish the lobster did not taste fresh...) but they do have other great dishes too!", 
      "This was our FAVORITE place to go when visiting my sister at U of I. Relatively reasonably priced but delicious Italian food (Olive Garden who??). I loved the pasta/sausage/goat cheese dinner (sorry, blanking on name), and bread with olive oil, pepper and parmesan cheese has never tasted as good as it did when I first learned about it here. I know there are other sites near me, and I need to think of an excuse to go!", 
      "I might be Biaggi's biggest fan! \u00a0Whenever family comes to visit U of I, I always suggest going to Biaggi's. \u00a0I would definitely recommend the Fettuccine with Lobster, it has a hint of spiciness and the seafood is always on par-not to mention the huge food portions you get. \u00a0I have been here in both small and large groups and been happy with my meal and the service every time. Biaggi's lives up to the Italian \"family style\" restaurant, but with a finer dining service. \u00a0I can't wait to be back for great wine, pasta and bread!", 
      "Three business colleagues had a dinner. The menu is quite large, the atmosphere nice with no loud music at the background. We had some wine, calamari, chicken parmesan and chicken cannelloni. The entries were tasty and fairly large, the service was pleasant and attentive. Its probably not the best restaurant I'v ever been to, but it's certainly worth a visit.", 
      "Not a fan. The service when we went was passable, but only from the waitress. The kitchen delayed all our food because they messed up a steak (seriously, how do you mess up a steak?) which meant that everything we ate was cold. From what I can tell it wouldn't be bad warm- I had the stromboli, which was passable as is- but when you mess up that badly, it's hard to make fans.Also, unrelated, the wine seemed rather expensive. Maybe that's just me, though.", 
      "Biaggi's is fantastic. They've recently remodeled and it looks great in there. I feel comfortable and relaxed. The servers are knowledgeable on the food and the vast wine selection. Be sure to ask for Kyle's section of he is there. He won't let you down in pairing the perfect wine with anything you want to eat. I make sure to try their specials every time I'm in there. The risotto is almost always on point. It can be pricey if you aren't paying attention, but the food is well worth it. With the remodel, I was hoping they'd update the bathrooms but they still seem tacky to me. But if that's my only complaint, you know I believe in this restaurant. Five stars (4.5 if I could - due to the bathrooms and the priciness, but it's way better than Olive Garden.)", 
      "Great service and great food for a first time customer. Would definitely recommend for a date night.", 
      "Very very good Italian food. However, the good food comes with a very steep price. If your looking for a good date night restaurant this is the place to go.", 
      "Biaggi's is my favorite go-to place for a nice sit down meal in Champaign. I have been there countless times and I have never had a bad experience. I have also tried my fair share of different dishes on their menu and have never been disappointed. I had the chicken parmesan the last time I went in February, but just about anything you order will be delicious. I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time because it can get very crowded especially on the weekends, or even during the weekdays. Sometimes there are different kinds of events and people may go to Biaggi's in a big group afterwards so it doesn't hurt to be on the safe side and make a reservation.", 
      "Favorite. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0Love the scallops over risotto. \u00a0My husband and I usually split a house salad. \u00a0Always excellent service.", 
      "I was really pleasantly surprised when we went here a couple of days ago. The menu has been changed and streamlined, and it includes some really nice dishes. My wife and I both loved our entr\u00e9es, and the service was kind and fast. Had a great time!", 
      "Good food for a chain. \u00a0Fairly pricey.I had the crab cake app, and the chicken Alfredo dinner. \u00a0You can tell that most, if not all of the ingredients arrive frozen. \u00a0That is how chains work, and this one is no different. \u00a0Our server was excellent!!", 
      "Great staff but food unfortunately was lacking. Perhaps it just so happened that I ordered the \"wrong\" dish (a rather mediocre Farfalle Alfredo) but I never enjoyed their butternut squash ravioli in the past either so...I will give them props for dessert though. The lemon tower cake was luscious and served with the freshest strawberries.", 
      "Beautiful restaurant, awesome service, delicious bread & oil/parmesan. Very mediocre food. However, if you like donuts... I highly recommend Bomboloni.. one of the best deserts I've EVER had. (+1 star)", 
      "I'd give them a zero if I could.Is the food good? \u00a0Yes. \u00a0So why the low rating? \u00a0Dishonesty and abysmal customer service.My wife and I hosted a party for 40 of our closest friends and family. \u00a0We pre-arranged for each guest to be able to order whatever they wanted off the menu. \u00a0This included appetizers, entrees and desserts. \u00a0Dinner went off well up until the dessert part.The guests were all given dessert menus and as they began to order desserts, I was pulled aside and told that they ran out of most of the desserts. \u00a0Strange, I thought. \u00a0How they heck do you run out of creme brulee?! The manager explained that they had been very busy the night before and simply ran out of most everything. \u00a0However, they still had cheesecake, chocolate cake, and lemon tower cake.Again, strange. \u00a0So they ran out of everything OTHER than the stuff that could be easily sliced and flopped on a plate for the least amount of effort.Bullshit.Indeed, we were informed by one of the kinder and more empathetic waitresses that this was a complete and utter lie. \u00a0Not only did they not run out of desserts, but they were serving them to other patrons at the restaurant. \u00a0Heck, one of our guests was even able to score the bread pudding before we were unceremoniously cut off like a drunk at closing time.I would love for somebody to explain to me why the $1,200 I spent was not good enough to: A) get what I specifically arranged for IN ADVANCE; and B) at least get the common courtesy of an honest explanation.Would I have been upset if they had told me they simply could not do the volume of desserts we were asking for? \u00a0Of course, but I would have understood, and they would not have lost me as a customer.The real problem is that this could have been dealt with when we arranged the party. \u00a0We were promised one thing, and they refused to deliver on that promise. \u00a0As it stood, we told our guests to make sure they saved room SPECIFICALLY FOR the wonderful array of desserts that would be available. \u00a0I cannot explain the disappointment on the guests faces who were given dessert menus and had wanted to order tiramisu or bread pudding, but were then told that they could not have it. \u00a0Of course, we look like the cheapskates who wouldn't spring for the good stuff. \u00a0It wrecked what should have been a special occasion. \u00a0My wife and I spent more time farting around with the dishonest manager and chef than we did with our guests. \u00a0Pathetic.I have had two parties there and countless dinners and lunches. \u00a0I will never go back.", 
      "Came here for my graduation lunch and I gotta say more restaurants need to be modeled after this establishment. The food and service were impeccable. I made reservations and arrived early and they were able to accommodate us. After warmly greeting us, we made our way to the table. Throughout our meal, the staff were very attentive and checked in on us very often for refills and making sure we were enjoying the food. Here's what we had:-warm baguette and focaccia rolls: freeeeee! -calamari-toasted ravioli-shrimp and salmon milanese served with risotto (fish was cooked very well and shrimp was succulent)-sea bass with cauliflower pur\u00e9e -cheese and prosciutto stuffed pork chop with asparagus-lobster pizza (my fav - crust was buttery and lobster was so tender)Overall, I had an amazing experience! Highly recommend this place!", 
      "I guess this is the fancy Italian chain restaurant. \u00a0While it is better than say Olive Garden or Carrabbas, that is not saying much. \u00a0On top of that it is just to expensive for what you get. \u00a0That fake, country rustic vibe is prevalent throughout. \u00a0Service is cheerful and peppy. \u00a0For a large group they did fine. \u00a0Everything from the kitchen came out at the same time. \u00a0Which is professional, though some things were cold. \u00a0Understandable, but I wish places like this would just bring the food out when it is hot. \u00a0Maybe I am alone in that regard, because most places will do this. \u00a0Anyway, that really is not a big deal.They shout from the highest high top table that everything is freshly made or sourced here. \u00a0If that is true, they need better sources or they need to make better pasta. \u00a0Just the typical over stuffed pasta dishes that are found in most Italian places. \u00a0The scallops are bad. \u00a0Rubbery, chewy, and flavorless. \u00a0The salads are not that good...the dreaded and bland Caesar, house, and wedge. \u00a0Calamari is dry, rubbery, and flavorless. \u00a0Average wine list, and a crappy beer list. \u00a0Both pretty typical for such a place. \u00a0There are not a lot of great options for Italian in Champaign/Urbana/Savoy. \u00a0This place certainly has that faux chain look that draws people in by the masses. \u00a0Which is probably why they have been open for so many years. \u00a0Though just an upscale Olive Garden. \u00a0Manzella's is about the same, with a much friendlier, welcoming vibe (if a bit dated), and better bang for your buck IMO.", 
      "It's delicious, sure. \u00a0And, whoa, are those cloth napkins?Just because every student, sick of dorm food, brings the parents here for \"something special\" doesn't make it exceptional. It lacks character, as most chain's do. What's so great about the place?Try some real local flavor - go to downtown Champaign or Urbana and support your local businesses.", 
      "I've had dinner and lunch here. It is nice for Champaign, certainly but frankly I didn't like the food. We had the shrimp and crab canneloni which I hated and swapped with my husband's pietro, which had an overpowering sauce. Service was good and ambience too.", 
      "I went here at 8pm on a Monday night and the place was dead but I can't understand why. \u00a0The service was great. \u00a0Bread was brought right away and it was very good. \u00a0The chicken parmesan wasn't amazing, but it was pretty good. \u00a0Dessert was divine -- I had the white chocolate bread pudding and fell in love. \u00a0They also had a nutella skillet cookie that was calling my name but I could only pick one. \u00a0I'll definitely be trying this place again.", 
      "Not bad! It's actually relatively cheap for the size of the portions, compared to other Italian places in San Francisco and New York, and the entrees can be easily split.During lunch, they have this option where you can select two items and have unlimited refills of soup or salad with a sandwich. For just $8.00, it's a good idea and delicious! I tried their chicken marsala for dinner and found the chicken kind of dry.We went in for dinner and lunch the next day - the waiters remembered us, probably because we were the only asians there the previous evening. It's not too far from UIUC campus!", 
      "I wasn't aware this was a chain until I saw Ramya K's review. \u00a0Biaggi's quality and look is a step above Olive Garden. \u00a0Ambience is similar to Macaroni Grill (open space, higher ceilings).Nice warm bread served right away, to be dipped in olive oil. \u00a0My fellow diners loaded up their olive oil with grated parm, also on the table, before dipping.I went with the Lobster Corn Chowder to start - large bowl of sweet, creamy soup with chunks of lobster and vegetables. \u00a0My main was the Roasted Beet and Arugula Salad. \u00a0Beautiful presentation and a decent size for an entree if you aren't starving (or you've already eaten a big bowl of soup and two pieces of bread). \u00a0In addition to the beets and arugula, this salad also had avocado chunks and dried cherries plus three rounds of Montchevre goat cheese coated with spicy ground walnuts. \u00a0I went with our waitress's recommendation and subbed the Honey Balsamic dressing that was supposed to accompany my salad with a creamy Italian-type. \u00a0Very nice all around.My fellow diners chose the Chicken Piemontese (her favorite - chicken breast stuffed with ham and cheese in a lemon butter sauce, with potatoes and veg), the Filet Mignon (which was a decent 8oz size and looked well prepared, served with potatoes and veg), and the Rigatoni alla Toscana (pasta in red sauce with sausage, onions and peppers). \u00a0I wish I could have tempted them to try an appetizer or two because this part of the menu looked very nice. \u00a0I may have to go back alone and try one - Bacon Wrapped Dates or Tomato Mozzarella Caprese - with a glass of wine, at the bar.", 
      "I had an ex-girlfriend going to school at U of I who used to always talk about this place, but I never got a chance to go. But I went there with my girlfriend (now wife) around October/November of 2007. First, the wait staff: These people are always great to deal with. They're nice and friendly and always seem so upbeat. Makes the whole dining experience that much better. The drinks: I'm a Jameson fan, so there's really not much you can mess up on there, but my wife seems to love the wine so I'll take her word for it. Haven't tried anytihng else though.The food: One word, GREAT. Obviously, being an italian restaurant, I expected the food to be bland, but oh my god, was it good! Its got flavor and they'll go out of their way to change the dishes to your tastes (in my case, SPICY). Great place overall, but what makes it so good is the wait staff. I can't tell you how important this small thing is for me because it can seriously make or break a lot of restaurants. I believe there is a Biaggi's in Naperville also, although I haven't tried them out yet so I really can't say much, but one day (I mean hell, it is a lot closer than Champaign!).", 
      "I genuinely like Biaggi's. \u00a0It is, by far, one of the better restaurants in the Champaign/Urbana area. \u00a0 It has a dark and romantic atmosphere that is nice for date night, but casual enough to bring your family after that U of I special occasion. \u00a0The food and prices are where it loses some stars for me. \u00a0The entrees are a little pricey and on top of that, all the sides are a la carte. Even though the food is good, I do not think it is good enough to justify the prices. \u00a0I think this restaurant gets away with charging so much because it is located in a college town that does not have many high quality restaurants. \u00a0The entrees I would recommend and that are worth the money are: the ravioli quattro formaggi, the lamb chops, and (I believe this is only on special) the quarter duck.", 
      "I love this place. Being from California, i found this place very reasonable and upscalethe server definitely deserves 5 stars for outstanding services. he was attentive, got our drink and bread refills right away, kept us abreast of our order status, shared tons of friendly conversations and made \u00a0recommendation from the menu. I hope they open a restaurant in California as i can't wait to try out there Chilean Sea bass again. Other people on my table ordered Shrimp Milanese and Fettuccine with Lobster. Everyone left with happy tummies and big smiles which is expected out of any excellent dining experience", 
      "While it is a chain, they do a fairly good job of hiding it. \u00a0Having heard a lot about this place from friends, I finally decided to give it a try. \u00a0My friend and I made a reservation for 5 in accordance to the warnings from friends that this place can get really busy.When we arrived though, there were only a handful of businessmen at the bar, and the dining area was completely vacant. \u00a0By the time we left though, barely an hour later, this place was completely packed so I would definitely recommend a reservation unless you plan on eating an early dinner.They have a nice selection of breads for you to munch on while waiting for your entree, but despite the fact there were only a few other diners, the food came out rather slowly and my dish was lukewarm (I had the Chicken Cannelloni). \u00a0It was pretty good, but would've been better if I had gotten it hot.The ambiance could be romantic I suppose, if that's what you're looking for, but if you really want to impress your date, I suggest going somewhere downtown Champaign/Urbana. \u00a0There's a mixture of people who go there, from casual college students out for a nicer meal with their parents to businessmen and women grabbing a drink after work.Overall, not a bad place to have dinner. \u00a0The service was very good (nice, attentive waiters), the food's pretty good, and it still allows for easy conversation despite the fact that it gets very busy. \u00a03-1/2 stars.", 
      "Long wait for bill, and with my 4 year old appraching meltdown status, I caught the eye of the manager, who swooped in and saved the day. \u00a0We love to eat here because my son loves the mac and cheese with a scoop of ice cream, and I get to eat some real food- so it's a good compromise. But, when a large party was being seated in our section as our server was just delivering drinks to the table nearby, my son started wondering loudly if he would ever get the promised ice cream. \u00a0The manager was wonderful- He jumped in and within a minute we had the ice cream, take out box, and bill. \u00a0We come here a couple of times of month. The strawberry lemonade is delicious, and there are lots of healthy options on the menu- Great salads and they willingly substitute marinara sauce for the fettuccini alfredo that accompanies many dishes. \u00a0I am a fan of a louder, busy atmosphere, which this restaurant has- It's always busy. It is a great way for families to get out to a nice dinner where the white tablecloths are covered with paper for coloring on.The service on this visit was not as good as usual, but it was just a timinig issue and not at all the server's fault. The manager saved the experience by jumping in and getting us taken care of like he did.The curbside take out is fast and easy too. Much appreciated!", 
      "Upper echelon Italian at least for C-U. Never had a bad meal here, maybe a bit overpriced.", 
      "Three words... Butternut squash ravioli!!! Amazing! They are a little but more on the pricey side but it is sooo worth it! Perfect for a date night or anniversary. My fianc\u00e9 had something that I cannot spell but it was delicious and smelled good. I highly recommend this place.", 
      "Always enjoyed this place for a relaxing lunch. Good food, good service, and a warm relaxing atmosphere, especially good in winter when it is dreary outside.", 
      "I really like biaggi's; the atmosphere in there is kind of a salving balm to the grody campus or slut-tacular downtown vibe. \u00a0It's clean and more refined than most other places you'll find in champaign, with good service and a lot of edible dishes.It's true what everyone else is saying; there's nothing impressive about the food. \u00a0I've never had anything bad though, and I actually think the prices are highly reasonable given the amount and quality of food and the atmosphere in which it is presented.You NEED a reservation for dinner if you are going to wait for less than an hour on the weekend.", 
      "We went here for a graduation dinner. The wait staff here is great, everyone is so friendly and accommodating. One thing I love at any restaurant is when the server brings over a drink refill before you even ask for one. I know it's a small thing, but it's that kind of attention that makes all the difference. The food was amazing! I had the black fettuccine with lobster and a bit of a chicken salad dish as well. Everything was yummy and came out fast even with a full house on what I assume is a very busy business day. I definitely recommend it here for a nice dinner whenever you're in Champaign!", 
      "I realize this place is a chain, but still, I love it. I just went back here last weekend and had to update my review and give it a fifth star.Their bread is just so yummy and I could honestly make a meal out of it. I also found that their lasagna (all 8 layers of it) is reallllly good. I usually try to order something new every time I go to a restaurant, but this lasagna has me hooked. But, if I can tear myself away from the lasagna, or rather, any of the pasta dishes, I've found the salads are pretty great and they're HUGE. The wedge is one of my favorites, but any of them are really good, actually.The iced tea is also suuuper good, and so is the strawberry lemonade. There are mashed strawberries in it and it's perfectly sweet and tart. I love it.Also, the nuttela skillet cookie with ice cream, holy cow. Make sure you order it, but do it early because it takes about 10 minutes to make. It's worth the wait though. It's phenomenal!I also can't review this place without saying how nice the staff has always been here. Everyone is very polite, very proper, and you feel comfortable here wether you're in jeans and a shirt for a lunchbreak or here for a fancy dinner. It's just good for any occasion.Basically yeah, I feel kind of stupid ranting and raving about a chain restaurant, but it really is one of my favorite places in Champaign and I'm reminded of that every time I go here.", 
      "The hype is real. Best sit down place for Italian ive found in champaign. I got taken here for a pre interview dinner. We we were served family style and I polished off almost all the dishes since no one wanted to be that guy that ate everything. I really didn't want the job so I just came to eat all the food. Needless to say I didn't get the job but I found a great restaurant. Its reasonably priced for italian food but I couldn't eat there very much cause I was a poor college student. I wished I could have ate there more though. Honestly its actually pretty cheap for the quality but my student loans barred me from eating there too much. Don't be like me and regret eating at this fine restaurant people"

      "This is a nice chain you can go to if you want something similar to Maggiano's. \u00a0It's cheap (for ~$10/entree).. it's okay.. but it's not anything special. \u00a0It's not really awesome Italian or anything. \u00a0In fact, the tiramisu is the same as the one they use at Olive Garden. \u00a0I also heard that this place doesn't cook any of their food.. it's just frozen food heated up. \u00a0I'm not sure if it's true though.Sometimes the place is so packed so I would really recommend a reservation. \u00a0It's on Open Table.If you must eat here.. I would recommend the duck confit and perhaps the chocolate bread pudding. \u00a0What is horrible would be the mussel appetizer. \u00a0Disgusting and not fresh at all!", 
      "I always seem to want to go back to a restaurant when the service is exceptional. Every visit at Biaggi's I always find the staff very friendly from the first minute you step into the restaurant to the last minute you step out. Biaggi has an extensive wine menu to compliment your entree. Some of the entrees are a hit or a miss however, the desserts are delicious. My friend ordered a scallion special off the menu which was came in a delicious sauce and I had the penne sardi which was alright (there was too much going on with the bread crumbs and the caramelized onions). I would recommend getting the white chocolate banana pudding for the dessert. Overall, I would recommend going to place again for their great staff even though the food is a little pricey.", 
      "Definitely a chain Italian place. \u00a0I've asked people who have tried Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill and Carraba's and they put Biaggi's up there near the top.My party of 9 dined there on a Saturday afternoon and due to the large size of our party we had to dine fairly early. \u00a0We were seated in a large private room where more of the bigger parties were situated.Service was fast and accurate.I ordered the Messina salad which was basically a \"Greek\" with olives, feta, onion and olive oil. \u00a0Very nice and very ample. \u00a0My entree was a stromboli which was just okay. \u00a0Everyone else had a pasta dish and everybody was very pleased. \u00a0Most had \"half-orders\" which I definitely recommend for females but if you're a man with an appetite you can definitely handle the \"whole.\"My only real complaint is that the temperature in our area was set to \"freeze\" which was fine during the salad phase but the entrees didn't stay warm for long once they arrived. \u00a0At some point in the meal one of the other tables must have commented because the A/C went idle for a few minutes and it made an immediate difference.Prices were very fair and they gladly packaged leftovers.We dined at 4 p.m. and there was staff galore to handle about 50% capacity. \u00a0I would expect they could easily handle an evening setting.", 
      "Nice place and great service, but the scallops were terrible (tiny, dry, and chewy little things). The scallops were served with an undercooked, starchy risotto. \u00a0The filet mignon was cooked well but could've had a better flavor. Also, it was annoying to eat asparagus that was cut up into tiny pieces, instead of just whole spears. \u00a0The best part of the whole meal was the bottle of Moscato we shared and the dessert, a Nutella skillet cookie.", 
      "Aaammmazinggggg! We got there late night on a Saturday and they were very very kind and packed our food up for us, which was delicious! The baked ziti is to die for as is their special pasta. We also had the calamari. Our waiter was a very helping hand and they gave us a lot of delicious bread to take home. Definitely a winner!", 
      "Great Italian restaurant. \u00a0Their pasta is always good, and our waitress was awesome. \u00a0There is small outside patio. I always enjoy eating here.", 
      "This restaurant is OK, not great. \u00a0Pretty much what you'd expect of an Italian restaurant chain. \u00a0The menu had the normal selection of pastas, chicken, and antipasti. \u00a0They also had a few off the menu specials. \u00a0I wasn't too blown away by anything. \u00a0I ordered the chicken parmesan and it was a good size (too big really) that came with two chicken breasts and a side of pasta.I can't really speak too much of the interior because for some reason we got seated in a semi-private room away from the main dining room. \u00a0There was one other large party in our room and they were quite noisy so I sort of felt like we were crashing in on their private area. \u00a0It was weird and I'm not sure why we were seated in there. \u00a0Our waiter was very friendly and the prices were moderate - around $15 for a pasta entree.", 
      "Traveling through Champaign-Urbana and decided to have dinner at Biaggi's as we were familiar with the menu. \u00a0We had been to Biaggi's \u00a0in other cities and had always had pleasant experiences...until this one. We had a 7:45 reservation and got there a bit before that. \u00a0We were seated within a few minutes. \u00a0We sat at our table for over 10 minutes and no service. Not even an acknowledgment. Finally flagged someone down and they said our server would be with us shortly. \u00a0FINALLY, our server came by. \u00a0We ordered our drinks...nothing fancy just 1 beer, a soda' and an Arnold Palmer. \u00a0We also placed our order. \u00a02 salads and a soup then our entrees. Drinks came and we drank them and we waited...waitress nowhere in site. Not sure how long it took her to come back, but it was long enough that we were all irritated. \u00a0We asked about our salads, and soup. \u00a0She said it would be out shortly. \u00a0It wasn't! \u00a0By now it's like 9:15. \u00a0We were not happy. \u00a0Finally about 10 min later our salads, etc came out. \u00a0Still no entrees. \u00a0We asked to speak with a manager. \u00a0He came by, we explained the situation. \u00a0Thank god, my husband did the talking cuz he's much more dignified than I am. LOLManager apologized and said he had a BRAND new kitchen staff and they were still adapting, etc. \u00a0WTF...really dude!!! \u00a0Oh by the way, did I mention this was a Friday night! \u00a0The manager also said he felt really bad and dinner was on him. \u00a0Very nice gesture, but that didn't make up for the fact that we spent our entire evening sitting at Biaggi's. \u00a0Our dinner finally came out at 9:45. \u00a0By the time we left it was 10:15. \u00a0The whole evening was a disaster. \u00a0Bottom line...horrible experience and we will probably not go to Biaggi's again.", 
      "This is my favorite full service restaurant in C-U. Incredible waitstaff, nice decor, and a wonderful variety of food (at reasonable prices) that's a step above most chain restaurants. I've never had a negative experience after eating here dozens upon dozens of times over the years with family, friends, family friends, and even once with my entire high school class. (Small school, of course---60 kids per grade---but the restaurant nonetheless did a tremendous job accommodating all of us, and our graduation dinner was flawless from start to finish.)Somehow I've yet to dine outdoors here, but the people who do always appear to have be having a great time.", 
      "I know, I know, this is 4 stars for a chain Italian restaurant in Champaign, Illinois? \u00a0Well, when you go with little expectation and those expectations are exceeded on nearly every point, it's worth an extra star or two!I won't belabor all the details, but the place was bustling and our server was conscientious and helpful. \u00a0The wine list was surprisingly extensive and we enjoyed a little-known (to me) \"Lemberger\" red wine from Austria. \u00a0Light, almost pinot noir-like. \u00a0Very nice. \u00a0The appetizers were pretty good - fried calamari was crisp and tender but a very small portion. \u00a0The seafood arancini were not very good. \u00a0I had the spinach salad which was a bit oily but delicious. \u00a0For my main course, I had the special Tuscan cassoulet which was a hearty and savory braise of beans, rabbit sausage, chicken and duck confit. \u00a0It was simply delicious, not something I would expect at a chain Italian restaurant. \u00a0Such an unexpected treat - I think I can still taste it!My dinner companions generally enjoyed their food as well. \u00a0Our desserts were competently executed including tiramisu, chocolate cake, and bananas foster (no flambe though).", 
      "Note: this is a delayed review. The last time I was here was in 2010.Delicious appetizer bread sticks. I have tried various fish, lobster, and veal dishes, all of which were very well-sized and appropriately flavorful. Prices are very reasonable for this kind of food.", 
      "I just left this place attending our annual office holiday luncheon. \u00a0I WILL NEVER EVER EEEEVER EAT OR REFER ANYONE to eat at this place EVER. \u00a0The service was bad. They had us crammed into a table with 10 people right by the server station. Took FOREVER bringing our food. \u00a0The waitresses attitude STUNK and my food was uncooked. \u00a0I sent it back and by the time it did come everyone was done eating and I just had them put it in a box for me. \u00a0NEVER AGAIN!! NO!", 
      "One of my favorites and probably the best Italian in C-U. They can do dinner for 2, big groups or anything in between. Had the family-style feast with a group of 25 and everybody was pleased. House salad, Farfalle Alfredo, spaghetti and meatballs all around!", 
      "Bruschetta = deliciousservice = excellentThe rest was nothing to write home about. Tasty, but average as Italian goes. Why aren't there any pasta dishes with vegetables? Most dishes use cream sauce. You can get better quality at Buca di Beppo where you get more for your money.Then again, it was this or Apple Bee's, and I'd make the same choice again.", 
      "I'm actually not a fan of Biaggi's. I think it's a great place to feel like you're better than you really are, or just different from any other family restaurant, but that's only because of the dress code and presentation. The food is fine. Their steaks are high-grade, but usually tough unless they are smothered in some strange sauce that smells, looks, and tastes funky. So you're stuck if you go with or without the sauce. I did enjoy their pork chops, though. Garlic mashed potatoes are tasty, too. Appreciate the bread baskets, but whether or not the bread actually tastes fresh is a touch-and-go issue. I dig the Champaign bartenders, though. Props to those charming folks. Strawberry daquiris are magnificent... They know how to get the tips flowing. Best way to go with Biaggi's is only use it for gift certificates or spoiling someone else on a birthday. I would never go with a group of friends \"just for fun,\" but I regularly give out their gift cards as thank you gifts.", 
      "Excellent restaurant, period. My ex-girlfriend and I used to go there on special occasions and they never disappoint.I have had several dishes there, seafood, chicken, as well as their appetizers and they were all incredible.I will continue to go there, no doubt about it.", 
      "So I went back for lunch yesterday. \u00a0Again, I was not impressed. \u00a0The food was ok. \u00a0I can't point out anything that was wrong with it. \u00a0The olive oil they use for bread dipping has changed. \u00a0It has an orange tinge to it and a little spice (but I liked it). \u00a0I got half a sandwich and soup. \u00a0I could probably find the same deal elswhere for cheaper.My husband and I got there well after the lunch crowd, but the service was a little lacking. \u00a0We sat in front of our empty plates for about five minutes before our server removed them. \u00a0There were other employees that were sweeping or cleaning near our table, and none of them offered to remove our plates.The employees were all friendly, and the restaurant was clean.If their goal is mediocrity, then they are well on their way.", 
      "I was in town from the West Coast visiting family and friends and delighted to see a menu where the food wasn't fried and the food portions weren't the size of a platter. \u00a0The menu was varied and I loved the food and was pleased to be able to have a half order of any pasta of my choosing.We went with a large group and were seated in the back dining room. \u00a0It was rather loud, because they put all the big groups together and we were sandwiched between a wedding party and a group of students celebrating their return to campus.Still, I have to say that I really liked the food at Biaggi's on this Saturday evening. \u00a0The wine list for Pinot Noir was great and my wine selection was very nice. \u00a0I had a wonderful half order of butternut squash ravioli and their amazing beet, goat cheese and arugula salad, which comes on a long platter. \u00a0However, this is the kind of food I can enjoy in large quantities and I did manage to share it at the table, although some didn't quite seem to know what to do with the arugula. \u00a0That was fine, as there were a few of us who were happy to finish it. \u00a0Wish I could have some of that salad right now. \u00a0I would definitely eat at Biaggi's again and perhaps ask for the first dining room as it may be a bit less noisy, although I can't say this for sure since I didn't eat in main dining room.The wait staff was very helpful, friendly and managed our large group exceptionally well.", 
      "I am in town on business and I have eaten here twice in the last two weeks. The food is really good and the staff is very attentive. I like the atmosphere. The food isn't just the normal \"Italian\" food offerings. They have a few unusual things which make this place better in my book.The bread they serve is great because they serve both a normal Italian bread and a focaccia. The first night I ordered the Chicken Pietro which was amazing. It was really one of the better chicken dishes I have ever ordered. I didn't want the vegetables that came with the dish and they had no problems substituting then for a different vegetable medley. \u00a0The second night I ordered the Salmon and Shrimp Milanese. Again, it was very tasty, and the risotto it came with was truly delicious.I was very pleased with both of my meals and if I am every around a Biaggi's again, I will try to eat dinner there.", 
      "While this place is a chain, it feels local to me (having grown up in Bloomington where it all started). While, I love this place, I feel that there is better Italian restaurants out there, but this is far superior to Olive Garden.The decor and setting is lovely and the noise levels are never an issue. I have never had poor service, but during the rush times, I feel that one could be neglected at times.They do have a nice selection on their menu, with various entrees, salads, appetizer, and grill items. They typically have a daily fresh fish also. They serve bread to each table which is real nice if not wanting to order an appetizer.One of my favorite dishes is the Ziti Al Forno, which upon ordering several times, has proven to be consistently amazing. Additionally, I recommend the Greek Salad. Overall dishes are well prepared, but at times, they have come over-seasoned from the grill.", 
      "Biaggi's is good. The service is fine. The decor is nice. But... I'm just not enthralled. Given a choice, I'd pick a different restaurant. I'm not really even sure why, other than the overall experience feels a little pretentious and I think the price/value relationship is a bit off.Maybe it's the lighting?", 
      "My husband and I ate here on our first date, so it holds a special place in my heart. \u00a0We continue to eat here occasionally when we aren't worried about calories or spending a bit more than usual. \u00a0Their soft bread and parmesan/olive oil to dip in is the best! \u00a0I particularly like the pasta dishes. \u00a0The tirimasu is also delectable. \u00a0I haven't tried everything on the menu, but I will say I've never been disappointed in my food. \u00a0Elegant Italian eating without being crazy expensive. \u00a0The only negative I can say is that, when it is crowded it can get very loud in there and difficult to have a conversation. \u00a0Overall, miles better than Olive Garden or Minneci's (sorry local restaurant I wish I liked you!)", 
      "The atmosphere was pleasant and comfortable.The service from our waiter, Mark, was friendly and attentive.I ordered the pork chop, which was well prepared. \u00a0My wife ordered the lasagna which was somewhat bland.For dessert we ordered the cheesecake and tiramisu. \u00a0The cheesecake was good, but the tiramisu was a bit over-soggy though still enjoyable.Overall it was a good experience, and all of the dishes had a lovely presentation. \u00a0Just a matter of finding the ones that they do well.", 
      "I went here yesterday for lunch with friends. The food was pretty good, as usual (I had chicken parmesan and my fiance had an alfredo dish, which he said wasn't that good) but this time the service wasn't as superb. My fiance's silverware was dirty, and my Pepsi tasted flat. I ended up just drinking water. Our initial waitress mysteriously disappeared after getting our drinks... another waiter took over and said that the other waitress had to \"take off.\" This was kind of confusing, because we saw her waitressing other tables right by us. Plus, I never like it when there are about 5 different people stopping by your table. One guy asked if we wanted more bread, and we said yes, and then he never brought the bread basket back. Different people brought out our dishes... and, nearing the end our waiter kept asking us if we needed anything (we were just sitting there talking), which made us feel like he wanted us to leave. I think we would have understood this had it been extremely busy and a long wait, but there was hardly anyone there!", 
      "there aren't a lot of nice restaurants in champaign, but i think this place does the trick. if you are like chicken, then the chicken marsala is a must! it was the best marsala that i've had...anywhere. their prices are reasonable and the staff are friendly. check it out~", 
      "I try to enjoy this place, but every time I think about giving them another chance...*sigh* major disappointment. \u00a0But what do you expect, it's definitely NOT homemade Italian food, which I guess no chain can compare to. \u00a0And if that is what you're expecting, this is not the place to go. \u00a0I guess I can start with things that I have found enjoyable in the past when not given the choice of places to go with a big group. \u00a0I had on occasion gotten the capellini di mare and found it acceptable for what it is. \u00a0A spicy seadfoodie tomatoey veggie sauce with a few scallops and shrimp and some squid. And a mound of pasta... mostly pasta very little seafood and for I think it was $17... yikes. (Not that you would expect fresh seafood but the shrimp were salty as if they had been but in a brine to take away their old seafood taste) \u00a0I also have gotten the wedge salad which tasted fine but was nothing special. \u00a0The lobster squid ink pasta is something I regularly got as well. \u00a0The kids menu was $7 for a bland \"pizza\".Honestly, I would just recommend to avoid the place completely.I would say the last 5 times (4 too many) throughout the past 2 years the service has been AWFUL. \u00a0I've encountered a very rude waitress who insulted the person paying for the meal as she was handing him the check. \u00a0Another time, when they were dead and we had been waiting a very long time for our food, I ran to the bathroom with my 3 year old and found her sitting in the back party room with her phone out texting/something who knows! \u00a0When I got back to the table our food still hadn't arrived. \u00a0Which this doesn't make sense to me because usually there are runners, but maybe not during the day when they are slow? \u00a0Anyway.. she finally came out with our food which had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for a VERY long time. \u00a0I had gotten a half and half pasta/salad. \u00a0My pasta had a film over the sauce from sitting and the salad was hot and wilted from sitting on the same plate under the lamp. \u00a0Again recently I ended up here when someone else was taking us out. \u00a0Two servers came up to us and claimed the other was being trained so they would both be helping us. \u00a0I thought great!.. with two we may get semi decent service. \u00a0We ordered our food, and when it came out, the pasta the person to my side had ordered came out not as it is supposed to be. \u00a0She had ordered the black pasta, which I must say has a texture to it and appeal that a normal boxed linguine does not. \u00a0The runner said \"oh.. your server didn't tell you\" and we said no and that the pasta was one of the main components of the dish. \u00a0She said nothing more, didn't offer to change it or see if she wanted something else and just kind of wandered away. \u00a0Maybe she should have been more up front about how disappointed she was when the server came back to ask how everything was, but oh well, just another nail in the coffin.Bread and pasta are cheap! \u00a0I could make any of the dishes they serve, in my own home, for a few dollars and with a lot more taste! I am done with you Biaggis.", 
      "Great service, great food! I love the capellini di mare and the desserts are awesome as well!", 
      "Great, \u00a0slightly more authentic that Olive Garden, Italian. \u00a0Great selection of dishes, all tasty, wonderful bread and olive oil. A good solid standard.", 
      "Resistance is futile. \u00a0You will eat and love everything on the menu. \u00a0I started with the 1lb of muscles and was blown out of my clam shell. \u00a0Oh yea the house Kiona cab is excellent, one mire please. \u00a0Then it was on to the crispy fresh lettuce wedge, another home run! \u00a0Er ah more wine please of the same 2003 Washington state vintage, \u00a0main dish was simplicity, spaghetti and meatballs, but the sauce was perfect. \u00a0Can't wait for the next dad daughter vist, as this will be at the top of grazing list!", 
      "Biaggis never disappoints. The food is always right on point, as is the service, and lots of yummy wines/martinis. The only issue is that Biaggis tends to be a smaller place with a huge following. On game nights, proms, graduations, and moms/dads weekends the restaurant becomes horribly packed and loud. The servers all do a great job to accommodate everyone. I'd recommend for the weekends such as graduation to make reservations months in advance. A nice perk is that Biaggis does rent out rooms. I love the outdoor seating in the summer too. I'm sad I only have 1 year left at U of I. Definitely will have to get my fill of Biaggis!", 
      "I don't care that this place is a \"chain\". \u00a0This is the second location in Biaggi's success story and there is a reason for the success. This place exceeds most downstate restaurants in having well-trained and ample waitstaff. The decor is warm, the food is good, the acoustics are quiet and pleasant and the prices are right.", 
      "Hmmm where do I start. \u00a0I guess I could give them FIVE stars alone just for taking on the daunting task of feeding 35 young, LOUD track stars and their parents. You see, we were in Bloomington for the Track Tournament at Wesleyan University. \u00a0We were tired, the kids were sweaty (I'm being nice) and HUNGRY and did I mention we were loud? \u00a0Well, we were given a private room, I presume in hopes of keeping the noise level down for the other patrons. Hahahaha well, it was worth the try. \u00a0Anyway, I digress, on to the service. We were assigned 5 waiters/waitresses. \u00a0They moved seamlessly throughout the private dining area, taking orders, filling and refilling beverage requests, bringing bread and conversing with us. HOW they managed to do all that AND get us in and out of there in under two hours is beyond me!The FOOD. The food was DELICIOUS! \u00a0Maybe it had something to do with the fact that we were on day two of eating food out of a cooler, but I sincerely doubt that. My husband ordered the Chicken Pimietro (I know I spelled that wrong). It was melt in your mouth good. Yes, I stole some off his plate (don't judge me). Hmmm, I hope he never reads my yelps and discovers my dirty little secret. \u00a0I, on the other hand, opted for the Chicken Pietra (succulent chicken breast stuffed with Smoked Gouda and Ham). This was served with asparagus and I asked for Herb Roasted Potatoes instead of the garlic mashed listed on the menu. Don't worry, I didn't actually eat them, I traded my potatoes for my hubby's zucchini and squash. All I can say is.....Why isn't there one of these in MD? Oh wait, I think another yelper said it was along the lines of Maggianos, but I can't say I agree. The atmosphere was different (better), the menu was less overwhelming in regards to choices and the customer service was spectacular. If I ever find myself back in Bloomington (read that as see you next year), I will definitely be stopping by WITHOUT the track entourage!", 
      "I like the ambience here and the service is wonderful. A perfect place to 'wine and dine'. The bar menu provides a large variety of drink options to start with before we get to dinner, and an exceptional dessert menu to follow up after dinner. Tiramisu is fantastic here. However, the dinner menu lacks much variety (very few options for appetizers), and most of the entrees are pasta/noodle oriented, which i dont enjoy very much. I wouldnt recommend this place, if you dont like pasta/noodles all that much. I stereotypically end up having the Bruchetta Classico (my favorite item in the menu) for an appetizer and the Chelean Sea Bass for an entree whenever i visit this place. It gets one extra star for its bar menu/desserts and excellent service.", 
      "Not my favorite restaurant in the town, but I do need to give them some credit because they have a whole gluten free menu and are very concious about Celiac disease and gluten intolerance. In fact, on of the waiters there has Celiac. The GF pizzas are very good, as is the GF bread. The fish dishes are also good. I'd like to have the GF pasta but unfortunately it's a mixture of rice and spinach, and I'm allergic to spinach (not related to my Celiac). I wish they just had 100% rice pasta. But they are very accommodating, although some of the waiters there are so perky that they can drive you nuts a bit...", 
      "I love biaggi's. \u00a0I'd say for fine italian dining, they are very cheap. \u00a0Their pastas are very fairly priced with very appropriate portions. \u00a0I especially love their lobster linguine or fettuccine.. SO good. \u00a0I'm also a big fan of their carpaccio which is large enough to be a meal in itself. \u00a0They have good fried calamari and salad, too. \u00a0They have very good service, very friendly. \u00a0I've been back multiple times.", 
      "Always great! \u00a0Whether we stop in for a light lunch or supper the service and food are always great! \u00a0Calamari and Wedge salad are great. \u00a0If you ask they will make a special donut for dessert, the sorbets are also excellent. \u00a0Nice place to take a date or celebrate just the two of you or a whole family. \u00a0Always a few beers on tap and a good selection of wine. \u00a0Bread and oil on the table, lots of friendly wait staff. \u00a0I really enjoy the Ziti.", 
      "Biaggi's was the place to go if you were a U of I student and wanted to take your family members to a 'nice' restaurant in the area; it was also perfect for dates and was always packed on Valentine's Day. \u00a0This place is a cut above Olive Garden...the food never disappoints and the service is fantastic! \u00a0Prices are reasonable and I always left feeling full and happy (and my wallet didn't suffer either).", 
      "This is not a bad place. \u00a0Big menu tries to be all things to all people. \u00a0Servings are large, some compensation for the fact that the food is good, but not great. \u00a0Additionally, the place can get very crowded and noisy. \u00a0It's a nice space, but I wish they would invest in some acoustical treatment - basically it's wood all around, and that gets loud! \u00a0I do think the prices are fair, and generally the service is pretty good. \u00a0This is a decent choice for people not looking to spend a fortune, with people who like a wide variety of items.", 
      "This is not a bad place to have dinner. The atmosphere is casual and the service is just wonderful. I had the carpaccio and squash ravioli and they were amazing. Price is a little higher than Friday's but trust me, you would want to come here instead.", 
      "Pretty great although it doesn't seem much different from Olive Garden. \u00a0Similar atmosphere. \u00a0Perhaps the menu is somewhat more authentic? \u00a0When I went, I ordered two appetizers instead of an entree just because I found them more appealing than the entrees. \u00a0The real reason why I'm reviewing Biaggi's is because our server was INCREDIBLE. \u00a0Probably the best server I've ever had. \u00a0I'm not exaggerating. \u00a0Go check it out.EDIT: I just ate at Biaggis again for graduation. \u00a0The place was packed and extremely busy. \u00a0We had a reservation and they sat us right on time (that's a first!). \u00a0Our server was again absolutely wonderful and attentive. \u00a0Despite being so crowded and hectic, Biaggis did a great job managing it."

      "This is review will be covering the Hibachi grill, only. If you do hibachi get the filet mignon and salmon or scallops. Ginger salad, with the hot and sour soup. I go here all the time for this and it has been consistent every time and delicious. There is also a coupon you can get for this establishment, usually comes in as a flier. i believe its spend $50 dollars get $10 off or the $25 and get $5 off. \u00a0Great deal and good food. If you can try to avoid the busy hours, as service falls a bit there.The regular dine in looks questionable and the sushi, at your own risk.", 
      "Extremely disappointed this evening. A party of eight of us were there to celebrate 2 birthdays....one of which was our 80 year old grandma. Once our bill came, exceeding $200, we were charged for a \"birthday\". We asked the manager as they were trying to rush us out and he said it was for the birthday cake. We explained that we were never informed of this surcharge as we've never been charged for a birthday before! He said we have to charge you for one if your bill is under $100. Obviously it was over. We also had a $10 coupon that they only redeemed for $5. The manager proceeded to argue with us even after we expressed our waitress never informed us of this charge. He then turned and walked away. This is no way to build repeat customers and quite embarrassing to have to deal with in front of birthday guests! We won't be back", 
      "This place is redolent of Elephant Bar: a sit down that's a bit higher scale than other chains, but the food is mediocre. I suppose this would be one of those places where you'd take a business client out to lunch or dinner. I had their sushi and it was definitely below average. I gave their veal a taste and my taste buds didn't find it so agreeable. The extra money you're paying for here is for the milieu, not the quality of food.", 
      "I was really craving sushi so I decided to head to Oishi on a whim on a Thursday night. I was definitely disappointed.I ordered the Pan-Pan noodles with chicken, a Philadelphia roll, and a Spicy Salmon Roll. The noodles did not taste crispy at all even though they looked crispy. They were chewy and the sauce that gather around the bottom made the noodles very soft and chewy. I had a hard time biting the noodles. An upside of this dish was that the chicken was cooked nicely and there were tons of veggies. The Philadelphia Roll was okay. I ultimately just tasted the cream cheese, which is okay for me because I like cream cheese. For the Spicy Salmon Roll, I was very disappointed. It definitely looked like a Spicy Salmon Roll, but when I bit into it, it was completely bland. I did not even taste the spiciness. All I got was a tasteless sauce with warm fish. A few good things:-The food was visually pleasing.-The service was good. The waitress refilled my drink consistently and didn't make me wait around for the check.-It wasn't busy when I walked in, but I don't understand why the food didn't taste better if there wasn't a back-up in the kitchen.All I can say is that I'm hoping this was just a off night for the kitchen and that the food gets better. I was very disappointed in the sushi. So I don't think I would be back especially when I know there are other options for sushi in the Champaign-Urbana area.", 
      "Delicious fresh sushi! \u00a0Best crab rangoon in Champaign. \u00a0The hot and sour soup is also my favorite in Champaign. \u00a0Consistently good. \u00a0The sushi is a great deal at lunch time - they have some good lunch specials.", 
      "Oishi was just good for me. It wasn't great. The server was attentive and nice. The atmosphere was chill, but kind of confusing. It's like in between romantic because of the lighting and I don't even know what with the tv turned to espn. That, however, wasn't bothersome.I ordered sushi and it was good, just not great. I like to order certain rolls at different restaurants just to be able to compare and Oishi's wasn't too bad. The food is definitely pleasing to the eye, but the taste wasn't exceptional. It was just good.However, their rolls are sufficient for the price. I ordered unagi ($2 ea) and the pieces of eel was really big! I was pleasantly surprised but, again, didn't love the taste. Just felt like there could be more to it.", 
      "Went here with some friends and it was great! \u00a0 My steak was cooked perfectly and their rice is amazing! \u00a0Our tae chef was a blast and seemed like he was having just as much fun as us. \u00a0Our waitress did a great job as well. \u00a0In spite of a few people in our group acting obnoxiously, she remained calm and professional. \u00a0This review is downgraded to 4 stars because my beef and onion side of soup literally had 3 small onion slivers and the rest was beef broth. \u00a0That aside great food, service and the chef we had was awesome! \u00a0I'll be back for sure.", 
      "I had a very bad experience before I even picked up the first order I had placed with this restaurant. I tried to use a voucher that I had purchased for the business. I did make a mistake in assuming it was for both carry out and dining in, but it was only for dine-in (why the distinction, I have no idea). When I questioned the person on the phone further and asked if he could make an exception, he became very rude, interrupted me repeatedly, and basically called me stupid for not reading the fine print. The initial mistake was mine, but that did not deserve the rudeness that I encountered. I will never order from there, and I am trying to get a refund for my voucher.", 
      "Very good! Never had a bad meal yet. I've been coming here since they opened & I'm so happy they have stayed around! Best crab Rangoon in the area, hands down!! General Tao's chicken is also very tasty! Some other reviews say, \"if I wanted good sushi/hibachi grill I would've gone to KO fusion/ Kamakura\" my reply to those comments is...really!? This place has everything those other places have to offer & they are just as good! It's also nice for those who want to change things up or don't want to drive as far as the other places. Def a place to try if craving Thai/sushi/hibachi!!", 
      "I am able to get quality sushi here slightly cheaper than the other quality sushi serving places. \u00a0It's not trying to be exclusively authentic Japanese, it's great if you want to eat at a fusion-Asian place and have your pineapple fried rice, sushi and spring roll all at the same time. \u00a0My fav items here are: house salad (good dressing), spider roll, sake-tini (they use cucumber vodka, AWESOME!), lao san roll, and Thai lettuce wraps. \u00a0For some reason I didn't like the rolls that included spicy tuna or spicy salmon rolls - it seemed more liked canned tuna/canned salmon. \u00a0The staff has ALWAYS been great with our baby - It looks to be a fancy place that is too high class for families but that is not true, and I will always feel welcome with the whole family.", 
      "Ate here for lunch todayit was delicious as usual!Service was excellent as well", 
      "I decided to try Oishi for lunch. \u00a0When I saw that this restaurant was located on north Prospect, I expected it to be similar to other family-style restaurants in that part of town. \u00a0Instead, I found Oishi to be quite sophisticated; a restaurant that probably would have fit in comfortably with the nightlife of downtown Champaign. \u00a0The interior is furnished with black leather, glass artwork (of scandalously bare-chested geisha...?), and flat-screen TVs. \u00a0There was club music pumping in the background throughout my meal (kind of annoying/inappropriate for lunch?).As a fair warning for those \"foodie purists\" out there, this is not a traditional Japanese establishment, but an Asian fusion restaurant, much like KoFusion. \u00a0There are options for \"exotic\" fare (e.g., sushi, Thai red snapper) and also more familiar, conservative options (e.g., fried rice, General Tso's chicken). Unfortunately, I've only sampled the sushi here, so I can't comment on the quality of the stir-fry items. \u00a0My impression is that they take popular Asian dishes and \"elevate\" them with a few fancy techniques. \u00a0The presentation of dishes is quite impressive. \u00a0On my sushi plate, there was a small floral arrangement and an artistic drizzle of sauces (including some kind of Asian \"barbecue\" sauce and spicy mayonnaise). \u00a0The rolled sushi was compact, neat, and divided into manageable sizes. \u00a0The sashimi was cut beautifully, showcasing the color and texture of the fish. \u00a0I had no problem with the freshness of the fish, either.As part of the lunch combination, you're offered a salad and a choice of different soups (miso, wonton, and hot & sour soup). \u00a0The salad was standard (iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, etc.), but the ginger dressing deviated in an interesting way from the usual recipe (I think I detected a hint of grapefruit or other citrus...?). \u00a0The soups, while dished out in generous portions, were forgettable and bland.Overall, I found the experience to be lovely and enjoyable. \u00a0The service was professional and the food was quite good, especially in terms of presentation. \u00a0I'm sure I'll be back to dine here again soon.", 
      "Picked up a dinner from here to bring back to the hotel, so I can't comment much on service or the experience of dining in here. The wonton soup was just plain sad with only 2 wontons in it and little else. The sweet potato roll was average. The ginger chicken was quite good - saved the meal a bit, but not enough to get me coming back.", 
      "For those who did not know, Oishi just reopened with hibachi grill areas. We have tried to take the kids to another local hibachi grill numerous times, but that place had restrictive hours and poor service.For those in our area who have had similar experiences, Oishi is your new answer. Hostess staff was friendly. Server was attentive. Hibachi chef was wonderful, and the food was great.We liked the decor and the food before, and have put this on our permanent list because of our experience tonight. Thanks Oishi and to everyone reading, go and enjoy!", 
      "ok, so trying a sushi restaurant on a Sunday afternoon might not be the best idea (everyone knows that fish is delivered on Tuesdays and Fridays in this part of the mid-west)...Decor=excellent. Service=Excellent.Value for money=exceptional (I'm thinking of my friends who like quantity in this line). Food...well...variable. The crab cakes are made with fake crab, and are actually delicious, but I wish they would fess up about it. The sushi itself tasted pre-frozen, which in this part of the world is understandable, but it just wasn't great. Sushi rolls were better, so I look forward to trying more of their 'cooked' food!. I wish them best of luck...", 
      "I miss the buffet!I went here with my boyfriend really wanting the buffet that I had here forever ago and I was so sad to walk in and see that it was gone! They replaced it with a bunch of teppan tables, which yeah, that's cool and all but 1. I didn't want to eat there because we were kind of under a time crunch and 2. I didn't want to smell like fryer food (except for I did anyway, boo). 3. If I wanted good teppanyaki I'd go to Kamakura.After I got over my initial disappointment, I ordered some curry. The seafood in it was good, but there was seriously ZERO curry sauce in it. My bowl of white rice that came with it served no purpose due to the lack of sauce, it was a bummer.I will say though that my boyfriends sushi was really good. I totally should've ordered that. But in all honesty, if I wanted sushi, I would've just gone to Ko Fusion, Kamakura, or Sushi Kame.", 
      "I really enjoyed eating here. \u00a0As one reviewer mentioned, their presentations are excellent. \u00a0The soup was just OK, and I thought the ginger dressing on the salad tasted bitter, but the entree and sushi made up for it. \u00a0The sushi roll was so beautifully presented with separate little plates and bowls for individual dipping. \u00a0I especially enjoyed the ginger sauce on the ginger chicken I ordered. \u00a0YUMMM!!!! \u00a0I absolutely have never had any ginger sauce this good. \u00a0They added some unusual items, like cubes potatoes and eggplant, to the stir-fry. \u00a0Surprisingly, it worked! The portions were generous and prices are really reasonable. \u00a0You get so much food for the money. \u00a0I enjoyed the atmosphere--very classy. \u00a0I felt like I had dined \"fine\" on a very inexpensive ticket. \u00a0I really hope they stay in business. \u00a0I highly recommend.", 
      "I had a great time at Oishi! \u00a0Last night, I walked in right as they were closing. \u00a0And, they still gave me good service and great food! \u00a0Everything tasted great and the atmosphere surrounding the cocktail bar was the best! \u00a0If I could split things up in three I would give the service 1.67, food \u00a01.66 and the ambience 1.67. \u00a0The reason I gave the 1.66 for the food, is because the portions of soup and salad are small however cheaper than any other place I have been. \u00a0The amount of wonton soup and seaweed salad was a tease. \u00a0But, very tasteful! \u00a0Maybe if the price was .50 cents \u00a0more they could give a few more bites. \u00a0I still HIGHLY recommend Oishi. \u00a0It is convenient for where I live and the building is clean and fairly new! The price for my plate of a 3 sampler tuna rolls, 2 piece wonton soup, and very small cup of seaweed salad with water to drink was $25, $30 after tip. \u00a0This puts this restaurant in a Spendy range for Champaign according to Yelp. \u00a0I am not sure if you include tip in the price range. \u00a0Any input on the price calibration would be great!", 
      "3.5 starsI went to Oishi a couple of weeks ago for the first time with a friend. I got a half off coupon from some website, so I didn't really expect it to be that great. I guess my philosophy is that if a restaurant has to consistently resort to selling half price gift certificates, then they probably aren't that good to begin with. The menu was a mixture of Asian cuisines. I expected a more Japanese menu, but I thought the menu was just all over the place (which is not a good sign in a restaurant). I got some chicken katsu-like dish which turned out to be pretty good. Huge portion, great presentation, and a bargain with my half price certificate. My friend got some mango vegetable dish, and it was good, but not great. One gripe though. Our waitress was just rude and plain bad. Probably one of the worst waitresses I've come across. She spoke poor english and looked like she's pissed off all the time. For a restaurant that puts such a heavy emphasis on presentation, they should probably hire a real professional waitress/waiter instead of hiring probably a family friend or something who just immigrated here. Pros: good enough food. very cheap with coupons (which can be easily found online). very beautiful presentation. Cons: rude waitress.", 
      "Ridiculously terrible service received on Friday evening. Should give zero or minus star if possible. I've being to the restaurant hundreds of times and received good food and friendly service. However, the waitress who seats me on Friday, whom I never even met before and claimed to be working all the time insisted that I must follow her instruction and sit at some strange corner which is cold and refused my request for change in seat (which never ever happened in my experience at the restaurant), claiming that those seats are 'reserved' when I see no sign of 'reservation'. When I insisted to make a seat change, she showed great impatience and anger and tell me to ask manager. I left the restaurant immediately since I have no mood in eating anymore. The waitress totally ruined my evening. The worst waitress ever! She simply destroyed the reputation of such a good restaurant. I suggest the restaurant fire her immediately. Otherwise I won't go and will strongly discourage all my friends go and be treated terribly at the restaurant. If you really love the food there, which I agree to be fantastic, avoid Friday and Saturday, which is the time the terrible waitress claimed as 'always working on'.", 
      "Food is great. Love their ginger dressing for the salad (try it! don't default to ranch or an american alternative...). The sushi is delicious, perfectly prepared. Their presentation is beautiful, and love the china. The only reason I knock off one star is because I feel their wait staff is clueless about how to serve customers. I haven't had a good server experience yet, really hope they step up their expectations of their wait staff.", 
      "I went to Oishi for lunch twice. \u00a0One of my friends said she did not like it, but I wanted to see for myself. On the first visit I had a salad with grilled salmon on top and a spicy salmon roll. \u00a0It was a lunch special. \u00a0I found the roll to be delicious and the salmon salad was very memorable (I think it was the dressing). \u00a0My husband had some sushi and a side salad. \u00a0Something about his salad was off. \u00a0I don't know if it was the dressing or the greens but it was very bitter.On my second visit I made my own soup. \u00a0I opted for a coconut curry soup with udon noodles. \u00a0The soup was flavorful and I had plenty to take home for lunch the next day. \u00a0I would certainly go back, and I would even consider going there for dinner. \u00a0I will avoid the salad, however.", 
      "I decided to try this place after a friend told me they had a good experience. \u00a0I'm glad I picked up an order to go, because if I was in the dining in, I'd probably had an involuntary scene. The sushi was inedible. This is no joke. I've had better sushi at Meijer. The only reason why I gave this place two stars and not one, was the crab Rangoon was pretty good. Although anything tasted better than the sushi. Needless to say, I threw the sushi away and made a 5 stars pb&j.", 
      "We had the seafood lover with miso soup and saladThe ambient trys to be sofisticated and romantic however with several 42 inch screens showing the sport of fashion doesn't make itThe food was Really good and it was enough to share between me and my lovely wife The service was very nice, the food came fast and tasty.", 
      "Absolutely terrible. The only place I've ate a salad with the spoon, it was more like a lettuce soup (ginger dressing). My mom ordered Pad Thai. I almost told her don't order Thai at a Japanese restaurant but I didn't. It was like a lean cuisine. The quality of the chicken was about the same as a hot pocket. Slimy, gross. I think I've had precooked Tyson chicken that wasn't as gross. The noodles were just straight up boiled and not even fried. Overall, un-edible. I got sushi and it was sloppy and not so fresh. I hate to be a negative nancy but do your self a favor and skip this place.", 
      "Personally, one of my favoriate place to go in Champaign.This place is more of a Asian Fusion than traditional Japanese or traditional Asian.I usually go out for their lunch special. A three course meal (soup/salad/meal) for $6.95. All three soups they offer there taste good and their food is really good. I personnally enjoy their Sambal Shrimp.The appetizers taste really good. Personal favorite is the calamari. I like the ones from here the most.The salad can create some issues. I do admit. the ginger dressing is too ginery for my taste and the salad itself is not too consistent quality wise.", 
      "We had 2 California Rolls presented beautifully and shared the General Tao's Chicken...everything was fresh and delicious! Very prompt server too!", 
      "NEVER AGAIN! It was not at all worth what we had to go through to eat there as a family. I have never seen such a poor excuse for management anywhere, she was RUDE and did not even try to explain things, she had no consistency in explanations and actually tried blaming her waitress for their problem. My family decided to meet here to have dinner one night. Unfortunately we found out how much they do not care for their customers. My mother in law purchased gift certificates for this place on-line and gave them to my wife and all her siblings as a Christmas present. We were all going to use these that night, not on one bill but we were all paying separate bills and were trying to use them individually. This apparently isn't allowed if you sit at the same table, but the manager said it would be OK if we sat at different tables. The manager then tried to tell us the only reason we couldn't use them was because the gift certificates have the same name on them, we explained that when you purchase them you cannot choose what name you put on them, its the name of who purchased them. To try to prove her point she whips out her iphone to show us a laundry service add from where my mother in law purchased the gift certificates. We explained that was completely different than a gift certificate to this place, then the manager actually stated \"your waitress didn't have the guts to explain this when you wanted to pay\", actually the waitress said it should be fine because we were paying separately. At that point the manager tried to make us feel bad because when we use the coupons \u00a0they loose money.... The only response to that was: So stop selling them!!! She even had some guy from the kitchen stalking our table while she attempted to make sense to us. The manager then said it would be OK to use the coupons, ran our bill, then decided against her first decision and re-ran our bill after voiding out the coupon. I will absolutely never darken their door again. I hope they lose all of their customers by running them off. Take my advice, don't buy a coupon to their place, if you do you may have to waste 45 minutes of your life dealing with the sorry excuse of a manager that was working. The worst part of it all was that they could have told us about this before we gave them our credit cards and we would have just paid.", 
      "Good, not great. \u00a0Everything was fresh, but just needed a little something to make you say 'yum'. \u00a0My friends Z & A weren't much on sharing, so I can only say my food was good.", 
      "Very rude waitress. Do not recommend.", 
      "Amazing place to eat!!!! Loved it! I went for lunch today with my husband and 9 year old son. It was my sons first time at a hibachi grill, and he had the best time. He asked to go back before they even brought the bill. The chef ( a gentlemen named ritchie) \u00a0was wonderful!!!! He even came back out to talk to my son after the meal to make sure he had a good time. I will definitely be going back again and again! Thank you very much for making my sons 4th of July even better!", 
      "Dined at lunchtime. The miso soup tasted a lot like a mouthful of ocean water, only somehow more fishy. The house Ginger salad dressing was pasty and bitter. The sushi had a mealy texture. The service was good. The food was not.", 
      "I don't think the chef of this place had ever been to a real Japanese restaurant, otherwise, it would be very hard to explain why you could actually taste the vinegar in the vinegar seasoned rice. Even you are a sea food lover, I suggest you stay away from the sea food lover curry. Nothing we had there could be considered Japanese food. Even if you ignore the \"Japanese\" part, it is just so-so. If you want to have Japanese styled grill, go to the chicken teriyaki place in the mall. If you want to have bento, go to Yellow Fin. Those are better choices in town for food itself. But, of course, the decor in this place is much better than the mall.", 
      "I love this place! The food is good. The service is good. I just go for the hibachi!!!", 
      "Nice presentation, nice interior, but the food is a bit underwhelming and expensive. If you're just looking for a nice place to sit around for a bit and chat this would be great. But if you're expecting the food to taste as good as it looks you might be a little disappointed.", 
      "Had a sushi lunch platter. \u00a0Price was about 9.50... I had wonton soup which was a bit too salty. \u00a0I also ordered shrimp shumai which was decent. \u00a0The presentation of the sushi was stunning. \u00a0It came with 1 shrimp, two salmon, two yellowtail and one tuna and a california roll. The fish is fresh as is the rice...but I don't think the rice is seasoned at all with rice vinegar which makes for so-so sushi. \u00a0Not a bad place for sushi but not the greatest I've ever had.", 
      "I really want to like this place, but it's just ok. The food is pretty good but not wowing. The service is decent, but the facility is reminiscent of a Vegas buffet that's been relocated in Branson, MO. \u00a0The owners don't really seem to care about it as the lot looks abandoned from all the weeds and the stone falling off of the building facade.", 
      "Decor is beautiful nice relaxed atmosphere. Salad comes with your choice of dressing....I opted for the ginger dressing....very bitter after-taste...not good at all. \u00a0The waiter was not that friendly/attentive...she was more busy eating her food a couple tables away. \u00a0I got the lunch chirashi for about 11.50 and 2 rolls for 8.50 which was an excellent price (spicy salmon and tuna) . \u00a0If you don't mind unattentive waitresses then this place isn't to bad for lunch. \u00a0Dinner prices seem expensive.", 
      "i still like oishi's food... but after eating in the dining room a couple of times in the last few weeks.... the service has brought my original rating down a notch. \u00a0the hostess/cashier at the front door.... is always doing something besides what she should be doing when i walk in. \u00a0it's kind of off putting. \u00a0in three times i have been there to eat in the last 5 weeks, she has been reading a book at the front desk... feet propped up, like we are eating in her library. \u00a0one time, i stood in front of the counter, and three minutes passed before she looked up at me. \u00a0three minutes... a short time to wait for a cab.... but a rather long time to stand in front of someone who should notice you immediately. \u00a0 the wait staff.... sigh. \u00a0another disappointment. \u00a0today, for instance, my party and i arrived at a little past 5pm for dinner. \u00a0oishi advertises twenty percent off for those who dine between 4-5:30pm. \u00a0awesomeness. \u00a0we were ready for our discount. \u00a0we ate, drank, and were generally merry. \u00a0our waiter was friendly enough, but screwed up our order. \u00a0he rectified it, and we were happy enough. \u00a0he continually came back to our table, twice reaching right across my plate AS I WAS EATING to take my glass for a refill. \u00a0i don't mind the refill. \u00a0really. \u00a0it's great. \u00a0however, i do mind your foreign arm in my dinner plate. \u00a0i don't even put my own arm in my dinner plate. the check came. \u00a0no early bird discount. \u00a0another in my party pointed it out to the waiter. \u00a0he looked at us with a blank stare for a moment, and mumbled something about his manager. \u00a0my friend again pointed out that we had dined between the discount hours, and he then asked us if \"we were sure.\" \u00a0are we sure? \u00a0yeah, and you can be too because you WAITED ON US. \u00a0my friend pointed out that he had totaled our bill at 5:33pm... and unless he took our order, served us, and we ate it in 3 minutes... we'd made the cut off. \u00a0he was still confused, but took our bills anyway and took the discount off. \u00a0 the wait staff seem unsure about how to really serve people, and some of them are just generally unprofessional. \u00a0the decor would suggest this place is trying to be upscale, but the service just doesn't live up to it.", 
      "Ambience is fun and eclectic, the food choices are basic and fusion at best. You can eat for $8 a plate up to $40 a plate. They also serve a few fun drinks--with lighted glasses and fresh flowers. \u00a0The wait staff leaves something to be desired however, and the noise of the heating and cooling take away from the prestige of the decor."

      "I like Milo's. The good: Nice ambiance. The food is tasty. I especially enjoy the flat pizza with smoked salmon. Hot dang, it's good. The ok: The prices here are a tad high. The food could be even better. To sum up: they have some growing edges, but you'll have a good meal in a happy atmosphere.", 
      "This farm to table restaurant serves wonderful, healthy foods. I had the eggplant entree and can hardly wait to order it again - so delicious! They also have a great wine list.", 
      "My fianc\u00e9 and I were in town for an event and wanted to go out for a nice dinner. Sadly, this place was a disappointment, and at least we had one another as company to make a crummy restaurant fun. I will start with the absolute worst thing about this place...... THE SERVICE!! Seriously, who is in charge of hiring here? They really need to rethink their whole staff. I would seriously equate the service of this place to that of a Pizza Hut. The waiter took zero interest in us. I asked him if the risotto was vegetarian or if it was made with chicken stock... to which he literally said \"Well, there is no meat in it and it comes with vegetables, so it is vegetarian.\" Sorry, this does not make it vegetarian. He did not even offer to go and ask the chef like any good waiter or waitress would do. Needless to say, I did not trust him and went with the mushroom ravioli instead. Looking back, I actually wish we were the type of people who could have not tipped at all, that is how bad it was. Moving on, the food. Overall, the quality of the food was very meh. As I said, I got the mushroom ravioli, and my fianc\u00e9 got the Berkshire pork chop wrapped in pepper bacon and garlic mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of onion rings. The onion rings were a joke. Literally, I would prefer the onion rings from Portilo's any day. I mean, I would even take Burger King onion rings over these. The ravioli was fine, definitely nothing special. This place seems to think it is way fancier than it actually is. My ravioli came out with carrots and green beans on top.... just because you make your food look \"fancy\" does not mean it is good quality. In fact, my extra dressings were luke warm, and I had to remove them from the dish because it completely threw off the flavor. I tried the gralic mashed potatoes, and they were also fine, probably the same quality you would get a buffet. I absolutely did not feel as though the quality of the food lived up to either the descriptions on the menu, nor was it worth the prices they were charging. I think we ended up paying $50 for everything here, when in reality, it should have been much less based on the quality. The decor is very eclectic. Definitely nothing special and it just felt like we were sitting down at a chain restaurant. Nothing about this place really seems to match up. They are really trying to be something that they are not. I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone, especially if you are looking for a nice evening.", 
      "This place is WAY overpriced and the food reminds me of eating in a cafeteria. \u00a0The only bright spot to my meal was the coleslaw. \u00a0The decor is very eclectic to put it nicely but nothing that makes it stand out. \u00a0Service was ok but the server ignored me at first until I had to flag her down to ask to order a drink. \u00a0Not somewhere if ever eat again.", 
      "Wow--I will not be returning to this place. \u00a0I have eaten lunch there on two previous occasions, and while the service wasn't exceptional it wasn't bad either.I wish I could say the same about my first (and LAST!) dinner experience there! \u00a0Clearly the managerial staff does not do an appropriate job of training the servers. \u00a0Our poor server was clearly overwhelmed and just hadn't received much if any training. \u00a0He was a sweet and sincere young man--I will always forgive service errors for waits in this situation. \u00a0It isn't their fault if they have the desire to provide good service but are not provided with the proper tools by management.About 25 minutes after we were served our appetizer, we still hadn't \u00a0been served our food. \u00a0We got the attention of the manager and told her of the excessive ticket time and also told her that she needed to provide more training to her staff (the poor kid actually approached every table and said \"you ok with just water?\" ) and she laughed. \u00a0I was serious.A few minutes later our food was delivered (incorrectly--wrong pizza for my son and wrong steak temp for my hubby, but at this point we didn't bother to bring it to anyone's attention). \u00a0We had literally taken about two bites when the manager had the nerve to grab the poor server by the arm and physically drag him over to our table. \u00a0She instructed me to \"tell him what you just told me\" and she stood there holding his elbow like he was a bad kid.I was incensed that she humiliated the poor kid in front of the whole restaurant and was aghast that she would put a guest in such a situation. \u00a0It is HER job to coach her staff, not the guest's.We won't be back. \u00a0And in the hours since our visit last night, I've heard from numerous friends who have had tremendously bad service there also and swear to never return.", 
      "Milo's was a bit of a letdown. I'd read the reviews on Yelp and was excited to check it out, but the food just did not deliver. I went there on a Saturday night with Arnab M: the place was pretty crowded but emptying as it was getting late, so we got a table right away. The food is American with various influences. I ordered one of the specials that day: duck breast with sauteed vegetables, mashed sweet potatoes and roasted pears (which by the way was almost identical to a dish I had at Escobar's in Champaign, see my review). I thought the duck was a little tough and overcooked, and the sides lacked flavor. Arnab had the Moroccan salmon: again the salmon was okay but the sides were disappointing. For the price (close to $20 per entree), I'm sure I can better dining options in town.Btw, the place is kind of hard to find. It's on NE corner of the Lincoln Square Mall, and it took us a little while to find it.", 
      "Five stars for my second to last visit here, three stars for my latest...I took my parents here about a year ago for dinner, and we had a great time. My mom loved her salad with 'strudel' on top, my dad had a steak, and I had the famous upside down pizza. (It's cooked upside down, then brought to the table and flipped over on your plate.) We also love love loved the smoked salmon and goat cheese bruschetta, so don't skip it!My latest trip was for brunch, where my mom and I split the spinach salad with strawberries and goat cheese and the grilled salmon pesto sandwich. The sandwich was fantastic, but the piece of salmon was very small. The salad was pretty good too, but priced like a dinner salad and sized like a side. The real differences in our experience were from the fact that the waitress kept forgetting things, from my brother's lemonade to an extra plate so we could share our food. However, even though we had to keep reminding her of these things, she was in remarkably good spirits the whole time and seemed genuinely apologetic for forgetting our requests.", 
      "This place used to be very good. Since it moved to its new location on Philo road, I think it has really gone down the tubes.Several complaints I have are:prices have gone WAY upthe new restaurant has no ambience, and the acoustics are terriblethe service was incredibly slow, it took over an hour just to get our entrees!the food has become mediocreIt is really a disappointment because this used to be one of my favorite restaurants in town when it was in Lincoln Square Mall. But just about everything has taken a turn for the worst now.", 
      "Their seasonal menu is all your typical continental stuff: \u00a0lamb, steak, duck... they're all good, but not blow your mind this is the best ever good. \u00a0Another thing is that they don't seem tend to have a professional wait staff, sometimes making the service a little shoddy on some visits. \u00a0However, I think this place is a lot better than other \"fancier\" places like Kennedy's or Silver Creek.What really makes this place shine are their specials. \u00a0They prove that Milo's will explore different varieties of food, such as Thai with a seared tuna in a (I forget what kind) curry sauce or Cajun with corn meal fried soft shell crab over jambalaya. \u00a0Every so often you'll see a recurring special (seared tuna with *blank* sauce), depending on what season it is. \u00a0The problem is that their specials are sometimes hit or miss, but the fact that they try so many different things is refreshing.This place is definitely a must try in Champaign-Urbana.Some general things to look for in their menu: \u00a0So after a while you'll notice that they tend to have some things prepared just a bit differently, but involve some of the same basic cooking techniques. \u00a0So despite the fact that you may not \u00a0see the exact same dish on subsequent visits, you can always count on certain things having the same solid quality:Rack of Lamb: \u00a0Pretty good and tasty. \u00a0However it is a bit on the chewy side.Steaks: \u00a0Whether it's a filet, ribeye, or strip, they come nicely charbroiled. \u00a0This is a good bet if you're a fan of steaks.Seared tuna : \u00a0Regardless of what sauce they serve this in, if they're serving seared tuna? \u00a0GET IT.Pan seared scallops: \u00a0They have these down to a science. \u00a0Always delicious.A specific type of pizza... mushroom Duxelle Upside Down Pizza: \u00a0This is just awesome. \u00a0If you're lucky enough to see it on the menu, give it a try.", 
      "I will start my review off by admitting that when my girlfriend and I walked in here for dinner we probably took the average age in Milo's down by 35 years. But honestly, WHO CARES?!?!The food is good. The prices are very reasonable, the quality is high, and it tastes good. Milo's is not as interesting as Escobar's, among C-U's \"nice\" restaurants, it's probably not the most interesting of any of them. It kind of reminds me of a restaurant in a hotel in Florida, which SURPRISE \u00a0would probably feature a weird mix of Southern, Asian, Italian and Mediterranean, served in a comfy, relaxed environment to a fairly senior crowd.Whatever. Come, eat, enjoy- knocking off stars cause it's got a lot of elderly guests is just silly.Last thing I'll say is get the lemonade. I know that's random, but I can't begin to articulate how good their lemonade is.", 
      "Just got back from Milo's. \u00a0This is a small cozy place with a real local feel. \u00a0The service was excellent. \u00a0The food was quite good. \u00a0I got a Cuban black bean and ham soup followed by a broiled salmon on rice with vegetables and mango. \u00a0It was a quiet and homey place good for a conversation. \u00a0Also, tonight (Wednesday) there were a lot of old women there.. which made it kind of cute =p.The location is really quite strange. \u00a0While it is connected to the Lincoln Square Mall, the entrance is on outside (specifically the East side) of the mall. \u00a0And wow I have to say that Mall is straaange to walk through.. nearly abandoned and oh so ugly.", 
      "ATMOSPHERE: Eclectic. The space is open, with tables lined up against the walls, and local artists portraits on the walls. It seems \"airy\" in the dining room, with enough windows and space to feel like you aren't crushed by a dinner rush. I rather enjoyed sitting by the window looking out at the pond in the back, though I found myself having to strain to do so because the windows are higher than the chairs. The one thing I will also note is the noise level. For some reason, although I didn't notice it really loud in the restaurant, we were unable to hear each other across a round table. It was really odd, and I can't say I've ever experienced it dining before. We had to strain to hear one another, maybe the table was too big, or sounds bounced off the walls causing an unecessary reverberation, but whatever it is it was unsettling, and made enjoying each other's company nearly impossible.FOOD: Fair. I had the springtime risotto with chicken, and while the flavors of the risotto were pretty good (me being a risotto snob), I was dissapointed when it came to the table. I ordered a RISOTTO dish (with a side of chicken, which I expected to be sliced over the top) - what I got was about 1/2 cup of risotto, and a whole char-broiled chicken breast squashing my risotto. I also got a random smattering of carrots and green beans that I didn't order and shouldn't have been included, given the veg in my dish. The risotto, while decently flavored, was slightly under. My children each had the kid's pizza, and these were really good, actually.They were hand made, nice crusts, good cheese to sauce ratio, and pleasantly flavored, not like the usual frozen tasteless slop that many other restaurants usually send out for kids. It made me happy to see that the chef was thoughtful about younger patrons, and I'd probably return based on that alone.SERVICE: Meh... our server was an older female with long white hair that she didn't pull back, leaving me to wonder how much of it got into the food on any given night. She was slow to take our order, and I felt like slow to bring the food, but otherwise pleasant enough, and did a good job of keeping up with water and drinks.VALUE: Fair enough. Again, I felt like the risotto was overpriced some given the portion size, but a little portioning could fix this. Expect to pay around $20 per plate for adults, and most everything else I saw looked fresh, nicely made, and probably worth it.", 
      "Milo's menu is short and sweet with many options to customize the meal to suit any taste or appetite. Every single entree looked good- it was difficult making a decision. The wild mushroom ravioli was mild and savory with a great cream sauce, and the perfect amount. The crab cake sandwich special was perfect in taste and texture. Everything that came to the table was perfect. I highly recommend Milo's.", 
      "We took a long walk with the dogweasel over to Milo's and had dinner there last night (Wednesday) and got a great meal at a reasonable(ish) price. I had the salad with the corn/bean topping, beets, tomatoes, pecorino cheese and mixed greens which was huge and very good. The dressing compliments this salad very well. The lady had a daily special cold yogurt peach soup which she enjoyed a lot, but which is not for everybody, including me. The complimentary bread was very good and featured a couple of different kinds, all good.For entrees, we had their Thai curry flavored Halibut (on special) and chicken, which came with rice and sauteed vegetables. They were both expertly cooked, pleasingly presented, and amply portioned. The tasty curry sauce was similar to a slightly spicy Panang, but was reduced to a perfect consistency for the dishes. \u00a0We both had leftovers. Their outdoor patio is really nice and looks over a pond and prairie area (that will soon be development, so enjoy the view while it lasts). The decor inside is also nice with original local artwork on the walls.The folks there were really nice and service could not be better. They let us bring our dog and gave us no jazz when she was less than perfectly behaved. They have a very nice wine list which, although not that large, has some very good choices at eminently reasonable prices. The selection of wines by the glass is superior. They also have a good beer selection, including Krusovice, which is fast becoming a new fave of mine. All told, the bill was in the high $50s pretax, which is not stellar, but about right for Chambana.", 
      "I went here for my birthday/Christmas lunch. It wasn't packed. I had the salmon on French bread with pesto. Honestly, I could have made it better myself. The other three in my party had the hamburgers. No one complained about that. They had given us free muffins while we waited, and that was excellent. The fries were good and the homemade ketchup was alright. The broccolli slaw as a side was excellent. I wish there were more of it on the plate. I noticed they also do special dinners. Like a Christmas dinner and a New years eve dinner. The price of the meal for four was around $55 with tip. The menu didn't have many options. The decor was medicore. The tables were small. The place would be nice to go to on special occasions or on a date, but I wouldn't eat lunch there often.", 
      "It seems as tho I have hurt Amy W's feelings by writing a critique on a restaurant I like. How dare I?! How dare I have a *gasp* opinion?Oh and Amy I do know about food. You go right on yelping dunkin donuts and red lobster--cause that's what *real* food is :eye roll:.", 
      "My dad and I were very impressed with the new Milo's in Urbana. \u00a0They got us in on a Friday night without reservations, and even though it got really busy as the night progressed, our waiter never hinted at needing the table, etc. \u00a0He was very friendly, knowledgeable, and there without being overbearing. \u00a0He was prompt with beverage refills as well, and had someone check in on our table when he was on break.We shared a crabcake appetizer, which was absolutely delicious. \u00a0They came out still quite hot, and the outside was very crisp while maintaining a softer inside. \u00a0The aioli on the side was great, and the plating very nice. \u00a0We both had the salmon with winter vegetable puree for dinner. \u00a0My dad and I are both seafood snobs, and the salmon was actually better than what we got on the east coast in October of last year.It is a little pricey, but the ambiance, friendly staff and excellent food make up for it. \u00a0That being said... I go there when the parents are treating, not when I have to pay for myself.", 
      "My experience was positive. The salad with bacon, pecans, feta, tomatoes was good, although not needed with the southwestern chicken egg rolls I ordered. The egg rolls had good salad greens and salsa with it. \u00a0Both of my friends ordered chicken salad in pineapple boats. Very creative, and I hear tastey. Good coffee as well. I paid $17.50 incl tax and a soft drink. The ages of people varied from 35-65. They have a small happy hour group. Nice environment. I saw people there I knew!", 
      "Absolutely atrocious.I chose this restaurant for my graduation dinner because I had heard wonderful things about it in the past. We called and made a reservation, and I was very excited.First strike: I called early in the day to make a reservation for 8 people at 6:30 PM. I called several minutes ahead of time as a courtesy to let them know we would be arriving shortly (because it was a Friday night and I wanted to know if they were on schedule). I reiterated our number of guests and the time. When we arrived, our table was set up for the wrong number of people, and the table they chose was completely impractical for the special needs of some of our guests (which were divulged over the phone both times). There were 5 other tables dining in the restaurant. FIVE. There was no reason, especially after my phone call, that this should have happened. We waited around for changes to be made, which took longer than it should have. However, since we're all human, I shrugged it off and got ready for my meal.Second strike: We ordered drinks, and I can safely say they were the worst drinks we've ever had. Not one person at our table enjoyed their cocktail; they were overpriced, contained almost no liquor, and were improperly mixed. We stuck to (very overpriced) beer for the rest of the night.Third strike: When it came time to order dinner, we asked the waiter about some of the items on the menu. He seemed to know what 3 of the dishes were, and when we asked him some opinion questions, it became obvious that he only told us to pick these dishes because he was able to pronounce their names. He had NO clue what he was talking about, and we decided to take our chances by ordering a variety of dishes. I also ordered the shrimp cake appetizer.Fourth strike: I waited for said appetizer for 40 minutes. In that time two more tables arrived, but three left. Our waiter did not offer refills or check on our table while we waited, and by the time my appetizer showed up, I was about to start eating the basket the bread arrived in. They came closer with my plate, I could hear angels singing, and as soon as they set it down I deflated. I had two silver dollar sized cakes with an extremely large amount of greens on my plate. My husband and I each got three bites between the two cakes, and they were very small bites. I paid $10 for this?Fifth strike: Our meals came out within 5 minutes of our appetizer (sigh), and again the portion sizes were disappointing. My steak was cooked appropriately, but it was the only one at the table that was cooked correctly. My husband ordered the lamb shank, and it was tough and poorly seasoned. My mother in law had the lasagna, which was cold. The only person who enjoyed their meal was my sister, who ordered roasted chicken.Between the poor service, the inability to honor our reservation properly, the awful drinks, the long waits, and the bad food, I'm amazed that this restaurant is so well reviewed. The amount we paid for this awful meal makes it twice as bad. I will definitely never be back to this restaurant. The fact that there were less than 10 occupied tables at what would normally be the dinner rush on a Friday night speaks volumes, and now I know why.", 
      "For sheer tastiness of the food, Milo's is one of my absolute favorites. I never knew I could love roast chicken until I had theirs (something with lemon and herbs, amazing). My wife loves the upside down pizza. The flourless chocolate cake is so smooth and silky, loved it. That staff is always really friendly and I just love the flavors here.The only thing I didn't love is the exposed feel of the tables in the dining room. I like a private booth more than a table in the open, but most of their tables feel like they are in the open. Maybe I'll request a table in the corner next time.If I had to pick one favorite restaurant in the Champaign/Urbana area, Milo's would probably be it.", 
      "David S. wanted to try out Milo's since Champaign doesn't have a million places to try, and Milo's had good reviews. We got a little lost trying to find it because the entrance is sort of hidden on the eastern side of Lincoln Square, but on our way we discovered some sort of teenage rave in the works, sooo random... We even directed someone to it. WEIRD and laughable doesn't begin to describe the situation. I ordered the Moroccan/Israeli spicy salmon with couscous which wasn't bad but came with this gigantic couscous, almost like tapioca pearls. It wasn't bad at all, but David's duck special was mediocre at best. David ordered some red wine, I forget which one but it was pretty good. Their waitstaff are all really niceee, mainly older men, which I'm so not used to. That's middle America for you, eh?", 
      "We had been to Milo's at the old location and had some very good meals there. I loved the hummingbird cake. The food was special. \u00a0Something must have happened when Milo's moved to its new location. We decided the year it moved to go for Thanksgiving dinner, which was our first time there. We had the worst holiday meal experience of our lives. Our reservation was not honored in a timely way. The kitchen was over an hour behind. A waitress told us the owner had been letting in people without reservations, trying to capture all the business possible. Since we had nowhere else to go, we stayed. The food was really underwhelming, just above cafeteria grade, from the turkey to the dessert -- which was too bad, since it was a set, limited option menu, which should have given the kitchen enough focus to do things well. Our family was very let down by the experience. We have never gone back.", 
      "I went for lunch and was the only person there under 65. I had the mushroom ravioli, which had some completely random cooked carrots on top. \u00a0I only had 6 ravioli, I guess because it was lunch. The food was fair, the prices were average. The decor was unremarkable. It does look out onto a pond which was nice. I looked at the dinner menu and the prices seemed a little high to me, based on how how the lunch went? I probably would not come back for dinner.", 
      "Milo's offers some of the most bland, thoughtless food I have ever tasted. Their management is evasive and staff are flaky and rude. My worst Thanksgiving meal ever was at Milo's, last year (the last time we will ever be going back to Milo's or Escobar). And back at their Lincoln Square Mall location, I learned that just because you like goat cheese does not mean you put it on everything.", 
      "The upside-down pizza with blue cheese, bacon & caramelized onions is a fluffy bread bowl full of cheesy bacon-y goodness and onions, but it does not have tomato sauce. \u00a0It's delicious, but not really a pizza per se.", 
      "What a great little secret in Urbana. \u00a0I know that it is out of the way, though really Champaign Urbana is small so NOTHING is that out of the way, but I digress. \u00a0I have been eating there for years, and I have always loved it. \u00a0I love the new, not really that new but newer, location. \u00a0Love that the outdoor seating is in the \"back yard\". \u00a0It's nice to look at a lake and not a parking lot. \u00a0The food is always consistent and delicious. \u00a0It changes as the seasons do to include the freshest in season ingredients. \u00a0It is classic American, but it is more then that. \u00a0I have had a great steak, Duck cooked to perfection, great salad, and my personal favorite which is an upside down pizza with caramelized onions and bacon. \u00a0BACON BACON BACON. \u00a0Whoops. \u00a0Sorry. \u00a0I just LOVE bacon. \u00a0But I'll stop.I also like that there is usually no wait to a shot wait at most. \u00a0If there is a wait they have a bar, or there is a great wine bar next door to have a glass while you wait!I also know they do a lot of charity locally. \u00a0I like that they are involved. \u00a0Make the 7 minute drive to windsor and philo. \u00a0You will be happy.", 
      "I LOVE this place. \u00a0I love the local artwork on the walls, the complimentary basket of unique, delicious MUFFINS delivered right to your table. \u00a0And the very well prepared, gourmet items on the menu. \u00a0The salads are perfection. \u00a0I have been here many times for lunch with co-workers and have yet to be disappointed. \u00a0My only issue is the weirdness they have with credit/debit cards....they will take them, but only 1 person per table when its separate checks. \u00a0So if you're planning on separate checks, bring cash.", 
      "I'm not sure what is going on here at Milo's lately, but.... \u00a0it appears to have become a senior citizen hangout in the last 6 months or so. \u00a0I went for Valentine's Day (again) this year and I noticed that there were quite a few seniors here. \u00a0Big deal. \u00a0Then I went there for Sunday brunch last weekend, and I swear to you, I was the youngest person in the packed place by a good 50 years. \u00a0What has happened? Since when do senior citizens like to eat weird/fancy/crazy food? \u00a0I thought older people liked boring food haha. Maybe I'm the one who needs to get with the times =)", 
      "The sisters who run this and the chef, Obdulio, are all very nice folks who run a restaurant that does what it does well. \u00a0That is to say, cater to those who want relatively conservative, mostly American-influenced cuisine plated nicely and with good portion size. \u00a0The space itself is pleasant enough, tucked in a corner of the now-decrepit Lincoln Square Mall. \u00a0Indeed, it is one of the few things left drawing people to that retail albatross. \u00a0Additionally, the place has been there for over 10 years, right around the time that several better quality restaurants started to assert themselves in the area. \u00a0So, they have a loyal clientele by now. \u00a0For food that is a little more adventurous by the same team, try Escobar's in downtown Champaign.", 
      "Lincoln Square Mall is dead but this place isn't. \u00a0The place is small but has a cozy feel. \u00a0Service is fairly nice. \u00a0Lots of good things on the menu: lamb, steak, upside-down pizzas, etc. \u00a0Dessert menu is fairly standard but they do have an assortment of teas served in single French presses. \u00a0Price is good, too.", 
      "My parents were in town and wanted to treat me and my friend to a nice dinner, so we went to Milo's for dinner. \u00a0It's located in this cute little building kinda out in the middle of an empty field, but everything inside the building is really nicely done. \u00a0There're lots of bright paintings hung on the walls, and generally gives off the ambiance of a really nice sit-down dinner place where you can chat with friends over wine or bring a date.Servers were all very nice and prompt, and the portions were HUGE! \u00a0I had their tilapia ($17), and they served one of the biggest pieces of fish I have ever seen. \u00a0My dad ordered their pork porterhouse and also got a huge slab of meat. \u00a0My mom's salmon and my friend's mushroom ravioli were a bit more normal sized. \u00a0As for quality, everything was delicious. \u00a0The tilapia was lemony, buttered, and breaded, and the fish was thin enough for all the flavoring to soak in but not thin enough to be anywhere near insubstantial. \u00a0The vegetable risotto that accompanied it was delicious as well. \u00a0Everyone else seemed satisfied with their food as well, though my father's hoisin porterhouse had a bit too much hoisin sauce slathered onto it, which made it saltier than it could have been.Overall, a very satisfying dinner for reasonable prices (probably an average $20 per entree). \u00a04 stars for solid comfort food that's done well in a very nice setting. \u00a0On a more random note, we noticed (or maybe this is just on Thursday nights...or maybe just that particular Thursday night) that the clientele consisted pretty much entirely of older Caucasian women, who would cast a couple of curious, innocuous glances our way throughout the evening (everyone in our party was Asian). \u00a0We didn't mind though; my parents joked that maybe they thought we were celebrities =P", 
      "Their roasted red pepper and goat cheese strudel is the best salad I've ever had. \u00a0I don't know what they put in the dressing, but it is wonderful. \u00a0The items here are expensive, but the quality and service justifies the price. \u00a0A great place for lunch and they do a really good job with carryout as well.", 
      "Had dinner there on Saturday evening. \u00a0I've been there before but wanted to go again to refresh myself before a review. \u00a0The place was relatively empty and we chose to sit outside on a beautiful night. \u00a0Service was good, but, then again, there weren't many customers. \u00a0We started with a brie in pastry. \u00a0It was quite good but the platter had more greens on it than anything else. \u00a0Would have preferred more of the brie. \u00a0One dish we had was the Duck Breast. \u00a0It was nicely cooked and the skin was just the right crispness. \u00a0The orange sauce was great, \u00a0accompanying vegetables were okay but the rice was bland. \u00a0We also had the Lamb, which was also nicely cooked. \u00a0The garlic potatoes were short on garlic, however. \u00a0The prices are a bit too high for what one gets. \u00a0It was, however, nice to sit outside.", 
      "Had dinner here with my husband and mom and sister visiting from out of town.As a starter I ordered the salad with a goat cheese strudel and herb vinaigrette. The dressing and strudel were excellent. \u00a0For dinner I ordered the crab cakes with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were good, but I was disappointed in the crab cake. I was hoping for jumbo lump, or at least lump crab, but it seemed to be all backfin. The seasoning was ok, but overpowered the sweet and brininess of the crab. My husband ordered the duck breast- which was very good, as was the rack of lamb with port reduction my mother ordered. Service was good, but plates were timed poorly- the potatoes and accompanying sauces (for the duck and lamb) were cold, indicating that the dishes weren't plated properly. All in all, a good meal, but not amazing.Have since returned to Milo's for dinner. I ordered Chicken in Pesto Cream Sauce over Penne, my husband ordered the Crusted Tilapia w/ Garlic Mashed Potatoes and a Side Veg. For starters we had salad and a salmon chowder. The chicken was very well cooked, but it was breaded and fried, which I think should have been mentioned on the menu- unless it's chicken parmesan, I assume chicken with pasta (esp w/ a cream sauce) will be grilled/sauteed. The flavor of the sauce was *excellent*- but the penne was overcooked. My husband's fish was well prepared, but he felt the batter was a bit on the bland side. It also did not look like Tilapia- it was a thick piece of fish, with big flakes, so I would have guessed it was cod, pollock, or hake- tilapia are thin fillets. The mashed potatoes weren't exceptional, but for a side, they were decent. The salmon chowder- more like a corn chowder with a BIT of salmon, was good, but not the best I've had. Again, our meal was very good, and certainly by C-U standards, great.... but I still wouldn't say the meal was exceptional.", 
      "I really like this restaurant, definitely recommend it. Great service, great food. Maybe the only think I like the least is that they don't have cheesecake!! (hopefully they will read this comment)", 
      "I came here for a graduation dinner on the recommendation of a friend (who works here as a waitress so I took the rec with a grain of salt). I was pleasantly surprised. We got a window table with a great view of the water. The server was super friendly and on her rec I ordered the duck - which was delicious. It was cooked perfectly with the right trimmings. I wish I had discovered this place earlier, like before I moved out of Chambana...I recommend this place for a reasonable meal with a great atmosphere!", 
      "I didn't have high hopes. \u00a0The decor was a bit like a fancy Denny's. \u00a0However, while ordering I was pleased to hear that they made their Caesar dressing on site with raw egg and anchovy no less. \u00a0It was good. \u00a0However, my meal of Moroccan Spiked Salmon was disappointing. \u00a0It tasted very generic. \u00a0Yet, one of my co-diners had the Tilapia at it was great. \u00a0It is off the beaten path and I probably wouldn't make a special trip. \u00a0However, if you are there, enjoy your friends or family and have a nice meal.", 
      "We had brunch here and it was just ok. \u00a0I had the Florentine Eggs Benedict. \u00a0 It was tasty but the poached eggs were too well done (yolk not runny enough). \u00a0The Hollandaise was not seasoned enough. \u00a0Bacon was burnt. \u00a0Split pea soup was interesting but ultimately not very satisfying.", 
      "The food is ok. But for the prices it should be much better. Some people really love this place, but I just don't understand their excitement. The atmosphere is pleasant and relaxing.", 
      "This is a really charming place. I went for lunch and ordered the grilled salmon with pesto. It was very good but I could have eaten another order. For those of you that hate coconut, like myself, the chocolate chip muffins that they bring out is loaded with coconut. Nice ambience and a nice view."

      "One of the best places in Champaign. It's a great place to take vegan friends. I recommend the warm potato and salmon (minus the salmon and add extra veggies for non meat eaters). I also love the vegan burger without the cheese. Their salads are good portions and are pretty tasty.Lastly, the drinks are great. I love the sake lemon drop. I always request a homemade shandy with their strawberry blonde beer and lemonade.", 
      "I went here last Saturday. The service was quite poor. After sitting down, we waited close to 25 min for our order to be taken and another 20 min for our food. Frankly, I was about to walk out but was swayed by the waiters candid apology. Focusing on the food, I ordered the Thai shrimp noodles. The presentation of the food was nice but for the price the serving size was quite disappointing. The noodles tasted okay but I might have been slightly biased given the poor service. For dessert, I got the carrot cake. The carrot cake was quite moist and soft. I recommend it.Overall, poor service experience and above average food. Given that this is champaign, it is a nice casual sit down place.", 
      "Visiting from out of town and came here with a small group. Nice location in downtown. The beer selection was OK, but nothing stellar - and one of the beers I got was on the warm side. The ambiance was nice, and it was quiet enough to make it easy to talk with the rest of the table, even though a world series game was on and it was pretty crowded. The food was just mediocre. The fries (which were recommended as a side) were tasty, but a bit soggy. I had a chicken sandwich that was tasty, but the amount of meat was pretty small - it was a thin cut (probably half a breast pounded flat) and I ended up peeling away half the bun, which was twice as big as the cut.My friends seemed to like their food (burger, bacon-wrapped dates), but I don't think they would give it more than 2.5 or 3 stars either. I gave it 3 stars because the prices were OK, but I'm used to California prices - so this might be more the norm for Champaign.", 
      "Loved the bacon dates appetizer! And the cheese curds. \u00a0I had the three cheese soup and the half of \u00a0Cuban sandwich and liked both. \u00a0 \u00a0The side house salad I ordered was fresh and had a light house dressing. \u00a0Some of \u00a0of our family had burgers and all were happy with the meal. \u00a0One of us had the Thai noodles and liked it. \u00a0We all shared pumpkin bread pudding with pecan ice cream for desert and it was delicious. \u00a0It is very clean and has a nice atmosphere. \u00a0Pretty reasonably priced for a family of 5!", 
      "This restaurant was highly recommended to me by a friend and did not disappoint! We started with the Reuben eggrolls and they were AMAZING. I'd like to go back and just get those, if I could! The steak I ordered was perfectly cooked, asparagus and potatoes were really well-seasoned. The stuffed poblano peppers were also a hit. What's nice about this restaurant is that the prices are definitely fair for the amount of food you get. Their homebrewed beer selection is great and I'd definitely recommend the Bela Imperial Pilsner. Customer service was superb and the restrooms were VERY clean! I'm looking forward to visiting this restaurant again.", 
      "The only reason I'd come back here is for the bacon wrapped dates! \u00a0Those babies embodied sweet, savory, smokey, and spicy. \u00a0Delish! \u00a0Omg, I just realized that delish is almost an anagram for Destihl. \u00a0So shall I say it was delisht*?Too many other things were off about the meal for me to want to return. \u00a0Too bad because those desserts sound alluring (pumpkin bread pudding!).- It took way too long for the waiter (who said he was new) to come back for our order. \u00a0Another waitress actually came by to ask how we were doing because she saw us looking around. - Long wait for the appetizers. \u00a0How long does it take to send over some cheese curds, bacon wrapped dates, and nachos? \u00a0The nachos arrived last. \u00a0I didn't time it, but the meal was a solid hour and 45 minutes. \u00a0I wasn't crazy about the nachos, but the cheese curds were my second fave after the dates.- My bison burger was extra dry (and I've had juicy bison before), and the bun it came on was too crumbly and dry as well. \u00a0I took 2 bites and ditched the rest of the bun.And the last and final straw:- My colleague clearly ordered the Carolina pork two ways (the entree is actually like 5 or 6 words on the menu, and he read off every word), but what was served to him was the Carolina wings. \u00a0He ended up just eating it because it would've taken forever for the correct entree to come out, based on our experience with the apps and entrees. \u00a0Also, rather than bringing out a free dessert or comp'ing the entree off the bill, we were still charged for the incorrect order, and waiter just kept saying thanks for understanding, and \"the wings tasting good?\" \u00a0That is actually the first time in life that I've seen an entree get messed up, and it's still charged on the final bill. \u00a0Wth? \u00a0I spoke to a manager, who removed the item from the bill.*the t is silent. \u00a0Duh!", 
      "I hate this place. \u00a0I have been here twice, and the portion sizes are pretty ridiculously tiny for anything that's not pasta, or bread, or french fries. \u00a0I got a generous serving of french fries with my chicken sandwich, but the sandwich itself was mostly bread and maybe a half a chicken breast pounded flat. \u00a0There was not much of the cheese sauce that was supposed to be on the sandwich, either. \u00a0Did it taste good? \u00a0Sure, when I managed to get a bite that actually had all the ingredients of the sandwich in it. \u00a0Also, the top piece of bread was hard, probably because it'd been under the warmer for a while.I feel like they charge high prices for mediocre food; I do like having a spendy meal every now and then, but Destihl is not where I would go when I do.", 
      "3.5 StarsI certainly like Destihl, but I'm not quite in love with it. I was mentally writing my review all throughout dinner, and it was a solid 4 stars--until the bill came. Don't get me wrong, I am happy to pay for amazing food, but it's gotta be spot-on. Our dinner for 2 was $120, after tip. We had 2 drinks each, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. I've definitely paid this much before for a comparable amount of food, but that was at some of my favorite restaurants that make sure every detail is perfect. And everything at Destihl was good, but not perfect.Here's what we had:--Stuffed dates - These had a great sweet/salty/spicy balance, but the barbecue sauce was a bit too much and a little detracting.--Mustard-glazed chicken - The chicken itself was delicious, but there was too much mustard sauce. The fingerling potatoes and green beans were both good, but not well-seasoned. The dish also didn't come out super hot.--Espresso-rubbed steak - The steak was huge and cooked well, and it had great flavor. Not my favorite steak, but still good. --Bruleed banana pudding - They made this gluten-free for me by not having pie crust, and it was phenomenal. It was the star of the show! I am still dreaming of this.The interior of Destihl is very nice--what you'd expect at an upscale gastropub. Our server was also very nice, but he was a bit new and didn't quite know the menu well yet.While I'm not head over heals for this place, I do think it's a great addition to the downtown Champaign scene! I would definitely come back the next time I'm in the city... especially for that banana pudding.", 
      "Every time I go to Destihl, I just find myself truly enjoying every dish. There are always some really interesting flavors going on and Destihl really does distinguish itself above its competitors, the other sort of new american or gastropub restaurants.Destihl does brew its own beer and it's generally pretty good, always a very reasonable price. You can also get growlers for like $20. Great deal. They generally have one of each type of brew and they're generally pretty solid brews. I got the Bela - Imperial Pilsner - which was great. Good, strong beer but very drinkable.This time I started with the Corn & Chicken chowder which has a bit of chipotle espresso BBQ sauce on top. Wonderful flavors, really was. Very delicate corn flavor mixed with the hint of bbq and given some weight from the just marginally creamy chowder. The soup was nothing short of phenomenal. Must Have.I then had the Farm & Field burger. Really interesting combination of flavors between the lamb and the bison within the patty and then it's topped with just a wonderful combination of delicious ingredients. Who would've thought that combining pesto, sun dried tomato aioli, havarti cheese, soy onions, etc on a burger would produce such an intriguing concoction of flavors!! My bun did come out quite burnt, but the rest of the burger made up for it.I'd get it again in a heartbeat.Only downside, no room for dessert.Can't wait to go back.", 
      "I love Destihl! We have come here many times and always bring our out of town friends here. \u00a0It's always busy, and with good reason. The atmosphere is casual, and the food is great and decent quality. Our friends love the samples of their micro-brews. From \"Smile Politely,\" (Champaign-Urbana's online magazine) \"DESTIHL Restaurant & Brew Works of Champaign, Illinois, won a bronze medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado for its Strawberry Blonde Ale in the 'Fruit Beer' category.\"The menu has many options ranging from salads to burgers to pizza. I personally love the beer-battered asparagus and beer-battered fish and chips. My husband has ordered the fish tacos on one occasion and pizza on another. The fish tacos were okay. The pizza is good. They also have a gluten-free menu and a kids' menu. Even though we have never taken our 2.5 year old to a kids' restaurant, and she is used to dining with grown-ups in grown-up restaurants, it's nice that they accommodate young diners with crayons to color on the kids' menu. Even the most patient young foodie could use a quiet distraction while they wait. Glad we have this restaurant in the C-U. I highly recommend it.", 
      "Bloody Marys were great, stuffed dates were spicy yet delicious, Mango IPA yum! Wait staff worked together well. An exceptional experience for a first time visit!", 
      "The service here was really slow, however the food and the patio is very nice. \u00a0We were travelling with our dog and thankfully they allow pets on their patio. \u00a0The fish tacos we had were phenomenal and the beer was quite tasty as well, however the fact that we had to wait so long for absolutely everything took my rating of them down a star. \u00a0They weren't busy, so I don't know what the hold up was.", 
      "Highly recommended! Nice bar with a great selection of their beers. I particularly like the Nut Brown Ale but there are several other styles to choose from. As for dining, we love Destihl. This time we had the Reuben Egg Rolls which were excellent. I had the Chicken Corn Chowder which was one of the best I've ever tasted. For dinner I had the Swordfish dinner. It has a very nice and spicy glaze and is served on a bed of arugula and other spiced veggies. Very impressive, very tasty, but it was a little small which the server told me ahead of time. Not the best choice if you are looking for a big meal, but a very good dish overall. My friend had the Pork rib and pulled pork dish with cole slaw and potatoes. I was very good, had a nice kick to it. Everything is served with a modern flair and a unique flavor profile. This is not your typical boring brew pub food. Very stylish. The atmosphere is nicer that most brew pubs and is great for a nice dinner out with friends. I am never disappointed at Destihl!!", 
      "Beer battered bacon. I could stop there, but there is even more. The beers are delicious and $5 per craft pint. There is an espresso-rubbed ribeye which I did not have but looked incredible. The dijon chicken was phenomenal.The staff was great. I told them it was my coworkers birthday and they surprised her with s'mores! Good ones! Cast iron roasted marshmallows and an awesome chocolate sauce. Cant wait to go back!", 
      "This is now my favorite restaurant in Champaign, followed by O'Charley's and TGI Fridays. \u00a0The food here is simply delicious and the atmosphere is wonderful. \u00a0Try the Thai Fried Chicken, spicy and incredibly good. \u00a0The food is good, the wait staff is friendly and the location is ideal. \u00a0 I simply love Destihl and I didn't even mention the great variety of beers. \u00a0Oh, I just did.", 
      "Awesome beer. Awesome service. Incredible staff. If I lived in the area I'd go there very chance I got. Unfortunately it was a business trip and I won't be back in the area in the foreseeable future. 3 people in my party had the t-bone and said it was fabulous. I had the strawberry and goat cheese salad. Wow! Never thought I could rave about a salad but it was amazing. Don't think you can go wrong at this restaurant. The menu holds an amazing collection of foods and certainly something for every palette.", 
      "I like their beers and you can get samplers. They have some great dishes like the fish and chips, the salmon salad, and burger but stay away from the meat loaf.", 
      "The best thing on the menu was the fries. \u00a0I continue to be underwhelmed by this restaurant. \u00a0This is my third time, \u00a0and enough is enough, \u00a0three strikes you're out. I went here for dinner this evening, \u00a0I am even writing this from the table. \u00a0I have had the Thai chicken, \u00a0fish and chips, \u00a0burger and fries. \u00a0All of these were subpar with the exception of the fries. \u00a0Temperature \u00a0wise the food wasn't hot and even though I shared that the food was not good, no one ever came to the table to address my displeasure. \u00a0The waiter was fairly attentive, \u00a0but the food was BLAND. People often recommend this place, \u00a0and for the life of me, \u00a0I cannot figure out what the attraction is. Possibly \u00a0it is the location or the ambiance, \u00a0but shouldn't \u00a0it be for the food? \u00a0I'm \u00a0incredibly disappointed and will need to go elsewhere to find acceptable nourishment.", 
      "One of the few good, non-chain food options in Champaign, IL. Their cheese curds are to die for and their white sangria is delicious. On busy weekend (Mom's + Dad's weekends, Graduation, Holidays, etc.) reservations are a MUST!They also sell growlers of their beer!", 
      "Once a year we go to Champaign and I always dread the restaurant choices. \u00a0We like this place! \u00a0Easy going vibe, spacious bar, everything squeaky clean, good beers to sample and the good variety menu that goes along well with everything. \u00a0The sandwiches, soup and salads were excellent for lunch and there were plenty of people sampling the many items on the menu... which made it impossible for us to get a table the next night without waiting. \u00a0So next time when I go, I will make a reservation.", 
      "The food was really good and the waitstaff was very concerned with making sure everyone was happy. I like the prices as well, thumbs up here.", 
      "I came here because their dessert menu had about 3 options with pecans and I love pecans. Their in house brewery interested me too.I haven't been to a restaurant where they offered 4oz sample sizes of beers. I got the \"Matt and the Giant Juicy Juicy Mango IPA.\" I'm not the biggest fan of beer, but this wasn't that bad to me and also it was nice to have just a sample size so I don't waste any beer.My friend and I started out with the appetizer, chorizo stuffed dates. I have never tried these and I thought that These were amazing. The perfect blend of spicy, savory and sweet. I got the Weissenheimer Chicken. I have to compliment the chef on how juicy the chicken was. It was a big piece of chicken and not one bit dry. I thought the green beans weren't cooked as long, but the mashed potatoes were really good.My friend got the Brewmaster's pizza. I liked that it was a personal pizza and they also offer gluten free bread. It's nice that this restaurant is conscious about that.The service was awesome too. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive.I felt like some foods had a spicy twist on them which I think is a nice flavor to pair with IPAs.I didn't get to try any desserts because the kitchen closed. I know so sad because I went there wanting the dessert the most, but at least my appetizer and entree was good.", 
      "Modern, trendy and most importantly, DELICIOUS! Destihl is definitely among my \u00a0favorite in Champaign. I've been here multiple times and have never left disappointed. My taste buds and tummy agree. \u00a0It's a good go-to, for anything from dinner to brunch; date or large group outing.My staples for whenever I visit: beer battered bacon, cheese curds and the fresh berry napoleon. If you get a chance, check out the weekend brunch. They have a killer strawberry french toast entree that is to die for. Prices are a little on the higher end, relative to a college student's budget but overall, not too expensive. Staff is friendly, accommodating, and fast. The only downside is, it can get pretty crowded, especially during dinner/weekends/special occasions, so make sure to make reservations!", 
      "Great service by our waiter. He knew the menu in & out. Took me so long to choose what to order because they have too many good looking options on their menu! Finally decided to get the bacon, blue cheese pizza but switched out the blue cheese for Goat cheese! One of the best pizzas I've ever had! So much creamy goodness in this pizza.", 
      "Fabulous restaurant! Ordered the Ruben egg rolls to start and it just continued to be amazing through our dinner! BBQ chicken pizza and fish and chips were really yummy!Update* went last night and had the stuffed poblano peppers and the wagyu burger and the carrot cake .... All were to die for! I don't like stuffed bell peppers and I cleaned the plate with the poblanos! Well done desthil!!!", 
      "Shiny, new, and inviting, Destihl is definitely one of Champaign's nicest restaurants. It's often the gathering point for business events or company dinners, which brings a lot of patrons to this restaurant. There's a good selection of beer that's, judging by the brewing equipment in the restaurant, presumably brewed in-house (and maybe some off-site) as well as a decent menu showcasing modern American fare. \u00a0Usually, a drinking establishment that decides to start cooking ends up making subpar food, while a restaurant that makes good food has a lackluster beer selection. Of course, this isn't always the case, but I usually don't go to bars for their food, and restaurants for their beer. Destihl, however, strikes a good balance between the two camps. \u00a0I had a chicken pot pie when I went there, while my dining companion had stuffed peppers. Both were perfectly fine, but nothing to write home about. The menu is made up of conventional American dishes, but unfortunately nothing too unique. You'll find everything you want here for a great meal, but nothing that truly catches your eye. \u00a0Overall, the service was excellent, our waiter had insightful knowledge on the beer selections, and the atmosphere here was just right. I feel like their menu is a bit too unoriginal to justify the price, but regardless, I'm sure you'll enjoy your meal here anyways.", 
      "One of my new favorites. \u00a0I've been twice now- once for lunch and once for dinner- and have been very impressed by the service. The waitstaff has been extremely helpful, knowledgeable about the menu (both beer and food) and very attentive.My favorite thing on the menu so far has to be the Flat Iron Quesadilla. \u00a0I wasn't that excited about it when I ordered (I planned to share with my mom, and that's what she wanted) but I was extremely impressed. \u00a0It's not your typical quesadilla- it comes deconstructed and has components like bleu cheese and roasted garlic vinaigrette. \u00a0At the risk of sounding like a total weirdo, I have to confess that I have been thinking about this quesadilla A LOT and cannot wait to go back and have it again! :)The beer is good and the atmosphere is very modern and chill. \u00a0I'd definitely recommend this place and I will be back again soon!", 
      "I've only eaten here a couple times. The food is good and they have some interesting specialty beers on occasion. I don't really go here to eat, even though the food is good and nothing's wrong with it. It's just not my go to place when my friends and I want to go out somewhere. Perhaps I will update my review the next time I eat there. For now, this is all I've got.", 
      "Hit or miss for me. Sometimes I have something I really enjoy, like one of their burgers, sandwiches, or steaks. I specially like the cuban sandwich, and the smallest cut of steak that comes with asparagus and potatoes. However, I have gotten stuck with some very salty meatloaf/fish, or a greasy pile of mashed potatoes. So I would stick to sandwiches and burgers.The appetizers are tasty but all high in calories, and pair good with the beer. The desserts are HUGE. I love the carrot cake, which is really why I go back.I like the sampler size beer because their house inventions can be too out-there for a full glass.", 
      "This place has great food, wonderful beer and a really pleasant outdoor dining area. Beer battered asparagus is amazing and their Banana Cream Pie is killer! \u00a0Only knock is sometime the food takes a little while, but who could notice or care with so many great beers to try! Best place for dinner to start your night out in the downtown area.", 
      "I really enjoyed this place. \u00a0We had a large group of people celebrating my grandma's birthday. \u00a0There was about 15 of us so we had our own separate room. \u00a0The service was really great! I wish I knew the waiters name because he went above and beyond to make sure we all had what we need. \u00a0It was fairly fast service as well for being as many of us as there were. \u00a0I liked the menu selection here to. \u00a0Lots of gourmet and different food items to choose from, not the same old stuff you see at most restaurants. \u00a0They have a unique twist to your average or popular dishes. \u00a0Pretty cool.Now on to the food.... They had me at beer battered jalape\u00f1o bacon! Omg it was delicious! We also tried the beer battered asparagus which was equally as good. \u00a0For my meal I got the green chile mac and cheese with pork. \u00a0It was good, I wish I would've ordered something with a bit more substance (not much meat in it) but I guess that was my own fault! The flavor of what I had was great though. \u00a0I also tried my moms stuffed pablano pepper which was great! I wish I would've gotten that. \u00a0Everyone seemed to love their food here. \u00a0Oh, and the carrot cake is TO DIE FOR! I highly recommend it, the pieces are as big, if not bigger, than my head! The prices were also fair. \u00a0I really enjoyed this place! Wish there was more places like this (for this same price range) around Schaumburg.", 
      "I have only eaten here four times. All four were great. Good food for sure. The spot has a chain feel to it honestly, but the staff is nice and efficient. I am not a big fan of their beers, but to each their own eh? \u00a0I live around the corner, and well.. it's kinda funny that it took me a year to finally walk in the door. Glad I did. Can be a bit pricey for the amount of actual food, but I should be grateful that I'm not allowed to gorge on the goodness of their food.I\"m happy to see the diversity in downtown. Not just another bar that is.", 
      "5 stars just for the Iced Tea!!! It wasn't your average passion fruit, it was something better; even garnished with an orange. The service was on the brink of \"too good\" and the food was excellent.We sat at the bar to watch the Illinois Basketball game; they have about 3-4 TVs to watch sports. There is also plenty of seating.For appetizers, we ordered the cheese curds, pretzel, and lamb meatballs. The cheese curds were amazing, basically just fried cheese with marinara sauce. The pretzel was also good - a little burnt in places but nothing too aggravating. It came with nacho cheese and mustard. Our server had the chef chop it up into bite size so we could share easily. Very thoughtful. For my lunch entree, I ordered the Dijon chicken. It came with two asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes with sausage chopped up in it. for about $10, i would order this over and over again. It truly felt like a hearty, but healthy lunch option, especially relative to other options on the menu. The price cannot be beat.", 
      "Brilliant. The staff was super friendly, the atmosphere was awesome, and the food was spectacular. I ordered the Thai fried chicken. It was literally a half a chicken on top of a bed of some yummy, spicy rice. I loved it. Ordered the fried asparagus for appetizer. The waitress was very informative and was spot on with suggesting the dishes. I absolutely recommend this place for first timers.", 
      "The beer was tasty. The pizza wasn't that great, especially for the price. Wouldn't order it again.", 
      "Great food. Average service that was a little slow. The hour long wait for a table was well worth it, \u00a0but with better service they could turn over tables much quicker.BUT.....the food is worth coming back for..... the beer batter deep fried bacon and egg burger was simply amazing!", 
      "I don't know many people that like Destihl. I think it's a nice, relaxed place to go for different cuisine than you would find a chain restaurant plus they have some pretty stellar brews. The beer changes often, so don't fall in love with anything. I've had my heart broken more than once by their ever-changing menu. The plus side is I'm forced to try something new when they switch things up. Destihl is a nice spot to go to relax and have a drink. They have a small selection of small plates that are interesting and mostly good. I've never had bad service here and love the fact that they validate parking!", 
      "You really can't go wrong here. The beers they have on tap are always spectacular and the ones brewed in store are even better. It's an all-around homie environment, haters are stopped at the door.", 
      "The key to getting to eat here is to have a reservation. Last year we came with a reservation once and without another time. When we did not have a reservation we were simply turned away even though we could see tons of empty tables.Recently we left the game early and called them from the parking lot at 2:45 and made a reservation for 3:15. We were promptly escorted to a roomy booth which really worked out because other people ended up joining us. We had to wait for a while for the other people to show up and the staff was very amenable to it, acted like that was just fine. They even held back our entree order until they got there.We liked the deviled eggs for the appetizer, they were really good. I had the chili which was very disappointing, I wouldn't get it again. My wife and I split the Cubano sandwich which was Okay.Nice big space, great staff and if you have a reservation, great place. \u00a0But the food is kindof college town fare which the space is not. Too bad as last time we were here the food was better.", 
      "Easily the best Wagyu burger ever! Ask the chef to replace the bleu cheese with goat cheese. It tastes great!"

      "skirt steak is amazing have to try slightly spicy but great flavor. Brussel sprout salad has to right combo of sweet and sour. Topped off with cherry bread pudding 5 star for just that.", 
      "This restaurant is expensive but definitely worth it for a special occasion. Great appetizers and entrees. The mixed drinks are incredible - try the saki lemon drop martini, it's amazing. The service is great. The food is great. For celebrations, my first thought is always destihl.", 
      "I have eaten at Destihl several times - it is consistently pretty good, occasionally exceptional, and rarely subpar. \u00a0The staff is always really nice, they are almost aggressive about refilling soda (glasses rarely get to empty, and aren't left empty for more than a minute or two!), reservations and parking are easy, the booths are comfy, and there are some really good items on the menu (Cuban sandwich, the burgers, the ancho chicken, and the huevos rancheros are great; the deep fried bacon can be skipped).", 
      "Good food but great beer. There are two locations one in Champaign and the other in Bloomington. \u00a0They both have unique food and drinks. I've never had anything I didn't like here.", 
      "Update: \u00a0Stopped by again.Still disappointing. \u00a0Their brussel sprouts are baked but watery. \u00a0Ick.I did try their scallops.. that was better on top of quinoa. \u00a0Not the best.. but certainly nothing to write home about.And the funniest thing I observed.. I don't recall seeing any beer on their menu even though they have their own beer distillery. \u00a0What?!!**************************************************\u00ad******************Maybe it's my big city experiences that make me not excited about this place.I had such high expectations and went here for dinner.. I'm never around anymore BUT I am here shortly for work.Tried their skirt steak which is a special... it was with a demi glace and green beans. \u00a0Really not that great.. it's okay. \u00a0I tried three of their red wines: \u00a0syrah, pinot noir, and tempranillio. \u00a0All were not that good. \u00a0Pricey though for Champaign.. compared to Black Dog the previous evening... meh.", 
      "This place is FANTASTIC! We came on a Friday night, probably one of their busiest. We called ahead for reservations (highly recommended) and only waited at the bar for only 20 minutes. The beer selection is wonderful and they taste great; I had the mango IPA and it was mind blowing!Our server Aaron was incredibly professional and knowledgeable; he confidently and accurately described every item on the menu we asked about. I had the beer battered jalape\u00f1o bacon and fried egg prime beef burger. Mouth orgasm! So good. My wife and her cousin were born and raised in this area. They proclaimed with confidence that this is the best restaurant in the area I couldn't agree more. Try this place!!", 
      "Oh, Destihl. How I wish you were anything above average. I had a delicious brunch at Destihl once (while sitting outside) and it ruined me for life, because for that reason, I feel compelled to keep giving the place a chance at serving me a delicious indoor dinner that's worth the price tag. So far, that just hasn't happened, or even come close. I might join friends here for dessert or for drinks and an appetizer, but I've learned my lesson with dinner. I think.", 
      "I just found out that Destihl doesn't have a dedicated fryer for their french fries and other \"gluten-free\" offerings. And they have stopped offering a GF menu. They were obviously trying to cater to the trendy gluten-free crowd, but not to Celiacs.", 
      "I've been a bad yelper and late on this review, but let me just say I can still taste the delicious beer I drank in this place over a month ago. I was in town for a recruiting visit and found this place on yelp. My food was great (try the lamb meatballs) and my beer was even better. Lots of great winter brews and an excellent spirits list as well. If you are in town like me for work, avoid the mediocre campus options. Come here, drink, be merry. Oh and sit at the bar... this little baby has a wait and reservation list.", 
      "Came to destihl for brunch (have been several times for dinner), and they do not disappoint. Started off with beer battered bacon as an appetizer with a delicious Bloody Mary. The brunch menu is small but the frittata and French toast we are were delicious! Will definitely go back!", 
      "I've been here twice and both times I left underwhelmed by my experience.I went here in a group of six on a Friday night. \u00a0My neighbors, another couple, and my date The restaurant was surprisingly dead in my opinion, but after our service and food...I can see why. The word/phrase/reaction Yelp uses with their rating system is perfect: A-OK.We sat down and ordered drinks. Water and beer for the whole table. We all were deciding what to get. My date went with the Ancho Chicken Salad (she loves avocado too...score!), and among the other items ordered were the Kobe (Bryant) Burger (I bet it regrets that night in Colorado...hahah), Stuffed Poblano Peppers, Weissenheimer chicken, Flat Iron Steak, and last but certainly not least...I went with the Cedar Plank Salmon. It was excellent! I was pleasantly surprised. I also added the Greekish Salad to my meal which was delicious and amazingly 5.75. I guess olives are like gas...price just keeps going up. I asked for the dressing on the side for both my salmon and salad, and our waiter went 1-2 on that one. I guess in baseball that's good...for this Yelper....not so good.This place is a Gastropub...whatever the hell that means. The food comes with a lot of flair and the taste is there, but if someone were to ask me, \"How was Destihl?\", I'd tell them \"eh\". The second time I came here I was paid for (hell ya starving teacher) and I ordered the Greekish salad (again) and Red Chili Braised Pork. The salad was great, but I asked for the dressing on the side and got in on the salad. The pork was awesome. I was no doubt influenced by my brothers' recent pork tenderloin dinner ideas.I have a ton of C-U places I can't wait to try. I am glad I tried this place again just to make sure the first time wasn't an anomaly. It wasn't. I would not recommend going here because there are much better options LITERALLY a stone's throw away. You could throw a stone to Guido's, KoFusion, and BGT if you crow hop!", 
      "After several times of driving past Destihl and thinking I'd come to try their brews one day, I finally made it, except not for the beer. I made a reservation through yelp for lunch and was promptly seated as soon as we arrived. \u00a0Our party ordered the beer battered asparagus and absolutely loved it. \u00a0The overall service was great and very respectful in helping my grandma get through the doors with her walker. The only reason for rating 4 stars instead of 5 would be that our waitress seemed impatient with giving us a few minutes to order and came off a bit rude when asking who would be taking the check. Regardless, \u00a0I'll be back for the beer, Destihl!!", 
      "went here twice, got pizza the first time, ribs the second. The pizza is quite satisfying and good if you order it, I would recommend that over the ribs. The ribs were kinda mediocre, but they were still decent, but not worth the price. Got a bunch of beers both times I went, they have rotating beers and home brewed beers that stay. None of them were that special.It is a nice place though, waitress and atmosphere is more on the refine side.", 
      "We were sat in one of the bar high tops for an 830 Saturday night dinner. Service was prompt and casual. I had a martini but would probably stick to beer in the future. Different beer portions allow for different tastings. The dessert list looked interesting but we were too full to try anything. CHORIZO STUFFED DATES ($5.95 for 3 small dates) - The dates had a nice smokiness flavor to them and did not need the sauce which over powered the dish. DUCK CONFIT POT PIE ($15.95) - At first I thought it looked soupy but once I started eating it realized the vegetable to sauce ratio was well balanced. The crust is non traditional as a pillow of herb puff pastry sitting on top of the vegetables (duck confit, roasted golden beets, brussels sprouts, pearl onions, sweet potatoes, green beans, fingerling potatoes, and swiss chard). A tad too salty but otherwise a playful, hearty dish.CUBAN-STYLE PORK ($9.95) - A good portion with juicy ham and all the fixings. Come in for some local beer and casual bites.", 
      "What a great meal and fun time last night.Server was Alex and he was outstanding!started with a flight and a drink and the battered bacon, YUMHubby had the skirt steak I had the jambalayatopped it off with dessert and we never do that, pastry with fresh fruit and lemon curdWe did not want to leave and can not wait to go back!", 
      "We went here for Mother's Day dinner the Monday after. Was impressed with the decor, menu, service, and food. Our service was excellent. I had a Flat Iron Steak and fingerling potatoes w/blue cheese. Steak was cooked perfectly. Potatoes were tasty.Other people in our group were satisfied with their choices. (We tasted each other's dishes to verify the deliciousness.) Portabella burger, veggie burger, American Kobe burger, chipotle shrimp skewers, & chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon were their choices. We had two appetizers - cheese curds & tempura-fried asparagus. Yum, yum.One of our dessertw was the highly-promoted banana cream pie. Good, but the bananas were over caramelized. (waiter apologized).All in all we were very happy with our experience. I hope to take other people to share the Destihl experience.", 
      "Told us it was a 45 minute wait even though tables were empty. Went on yelp and could make a reservation for 15 mins. Very disappointing.", 
      "I have never been more disappointed in my gastronomic experience in Urbana-Champaign then this past weekend at Destihl \"Brewery\" (who knows if they even brew beer at this place). Having been to Destihl a handful of times before the abominable brunch I suffered through this past weekend I expected an experience somewhat similar to what most people describe here on Yelp. That being a friendly staff, and decent (perhaps even good) food at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, Destihl has suffered a complete drain of quality over the last few years. When it opened, Destihl offered hot, quality food served my intellectual and friendly servers who were happy to be working in one of Champaign's better restaurants. Each time I dined at Destihl I noticed the quality of the food, the quality of the service, and the quality of the dining experience was eroding away. This erosion culminated with the brunch a group of friends and I endured this past Sunday. I say endured because our meal lasted from 12:30p.m. until 2p.m. The absurd elongation of our meal was not caused by entrancing, deep conversation amongst old friends, or by laggard mastication of our fantastic food. The epoch that was our brunch at Destihl was caused solely by the complete ineptitude and incompetence of our server, the manager, and Destihl as an establishment. To begin, our waiter spoke to our group at a volume slightly above \"whisper\". He seemed to not care at all that our decently sized group would likely give him his biggest tip of the day. One could almost assume our waiter was indentured to Destihl and taking our orders, suggesting menu items, and assuring that we were taken care of was a reminder of the chains that confined him. After taking our orders, three of which were simply \"eggs, bacon, and potatoes\" (not worth the $10), our group set off on the marathon that ninety minutes later would end in us getting our food. In total our group would watch at least seven other parties wait for a table, be placed near us, taken care of by the same subjugated waiter, eat, pay their bill, and depart. After the fourth group who had arrived after us was served before us, a member of our group called the manager over. At this point we had spent 45 minutes ordering and waiting. By this point the waiter had been unable to provide any information about our meal besides, \"they are still working on it, should be out soon.\" This information was decrypted by the members of our group through the reading of his lips and not by any sort of audible understanding between him and ourselves. We hoped the manger could provide us with additional information, this would prove to be a fool hearted assumption.The manager assured us he would check on our order and would return shortly. After three more groups consumed their meals, paid their tabs and departed, and another half an hour passed, the manager had not returned. At this point our group decided that if our food did not arrive by 1:45 PM. we would simply stand up, leave, and eat fast food. Finally, at 1:43p.m., 1 hour 13 minutes after arriving our meal was served. Destihl was relatively empty when we arrived and continued to be throughout our meal. Yet, our food took longer to cook than the run time of the original 1931 version of Frankenstein. If you have been to Destihl for brunch you know none of the menu items are difficult to cook, they are largely egg dishes accompanied by breakfast meats, french toasts, or a hot sandwich. Since this experience ended I have wondered what took so long for our food to be cooked and leave the kitchen. I have surmised that the reasons for our hour and a half endeavor are a product of the poor quality that now defines Destihl. First, our waiter did not care about us nor did he serve as our representative in the kitchen. Second, the cooks clearly lost track of our order because some food came out steaming hot, some came out only partially complete, and the rest came out lukewarm (presumably having spent an hour under a heat lamp). Finally, the manager who never returned to our table and only after being called over again offered excuse after excuse before finally saying, \"Well, I am sorry.\"To anyone who has invested the time to read my review, thank you. To anyone who has spent the time to read my review and still intends to go to Destihl even after I have made clear my utter frustration and disappointment, I wish you the best of luck. To conclude, my friends and I will never eat at Destihl again and I look forward to the restaurant that will soon replace it.", 
      "Just got told that the wait for two would be 15-20 minutes for brunch - there were four tables, top, in the place. This is the third time this same situation has happened. Their food is mediocre (a glorified Applebee's or TGIF) and continually is incredibly over or under salted/seasoned. Who would wait 20 minutes in an empty restaurant for this disappointing food?", 
      "Destihl has a HUGE menu. This is a great place to go if you want options. They've got burgers, sandwiches, salads, seafood, pizza, a bunch of appetizers and more. They also have a gluten free menu which is pretty rare in Champaign. They have a gluten free crust for pizzas, but it is baked in the same oven as the regular pizzas. They also have a great brunch menu on weekends.I've come here a bunch of times and overall I've been really happy with my experiences. I've had two bad experiences though. Once I got some entree that was pretty worthless and one time I had a waiter that continually messed up our orders throughout the course of dinner. Besides those two occasions, the food and service have both been great.Food recommendations:Appetizers - Ancho Chips & Dip \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bacon & Brussels \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chorizo Stuffed DatesSalads - Ancho Chicken Salad \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thai Steak SaladEntrees - Dijon Chicken \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Cedar Plank Salmon (If you're in the mood for something light and simple) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Gaucho Skirt Steak (The best option on the menu!)Drinks - The Bloody Mary is pretty deliciousI almost always get the gaucho skirt steak.

      "The menu has a good variety of options, which is nice. \u00a0I have had the bison burger twice, but they seem to always cook it a little too much. I tried it medium once and medium rare another time, and both times they cooked it longer than they should of. \u00a0But it still tasted good. \u00a0Service at the bar was very good.", 
      "I tried out Destihl this past weekend and it was definitely one of the best meals I've had since moving to Illinois.For our appetizer, we had the warm pretzels. \u00a0I'm a big fan of the cheese sauce they come with and they were gone pretty quickly. \u00a0I also sampled the fried cheese curds and they were tasty as well. \u00a0For my meal, I had the fried egg BLT. \u00a0You really can't go wrong with bacon, a fried egg and avocado on a sandwich. \u00a0The garlic dressing on \u00a0the sandwich was great too. \u00a0I was really pleased.I ordered an iced tea and I think it's my own fault for not looking at it on the menu, but I expected a regular iced tea. \u00a0Their iced tea is an orange tea that has a pretty strong orange flavor. \u00a0I wasn't a fan. \u00a0Our server exchanged it for a soda and I wasn't charged for it.Definitely give it a try if you're in the area.", 
      "While not overly impressed with what I had to eat I was impressed by the service and atmosphere. \u00a0I detected horseradish in the salad dressing and she immediately took care of it. \u00a0I hate horseradish and anything that even remotely resembles it. \u00a0My Grandmother had me grind horseradish roots once and it was awful. \u00a0My eyes watered and the stench was terrible. \u00a0Every since then I have not been able to tolerate it.I had the house salad with a portabello mushroom sandwich. \u00a0I didn't think the sandwich had much flavor. \u00a0We also ordered an appetizer sampler that included fried asparagus, bacon deviled eggs and some kind of egg roll. \u00a0All of which I thought tasted good but I didn't have that \"oh wow\" thing going on either. \u00a0It was a special deal for restaurant week. \u00a0You got 2 of each item for $10.00. \u00a0Some special huh?I would definitely go back and try again and hopefully I can give them more stars. \u00a0The service was really good.", 
      "Beer-Battered Asparagus, Craft Beer, and great food on the menu. \u00a0 You can't beat it.", 
      "The Ruben egg rolls are so unique and delicious. Our dinner was also very good..we ate the Thai chicken and a half roasted chicken (not sure what it was called). Both of these entrees were massive and very tasty. I knocked it down a star because the service was average. But above all, the mango ipa was the best!", 
      "Wonderful meal at Destihl. \u00a0Pretzel and Reuben appetizers were amazing. We all loved our meals . \u00a0The waiter recommended a beer for each of us and we really liked them too. Good service and seated promptly. Great experience.", 
      "I've come here on a number of occasions, usually work-related. The food is tasty and the appetizers are creative. As long as you're seated away from the bar, it's usually quiet enough to carry on civilized conversation. However, The beer is pretty disappointing, particularly for a brewery. As a result, this place is not my first choice for a night out, but makes for a good dinner in general.", 
      "I had really high expectations for this place...I have to say, I was very disappointed. The only reason for a two star rating was the appetizers. We got the pretzels with beer cheese and the deep fried bacon. The pretzels were great, served warm. The bacon was...interesting, but tasty. That is where the goodness ends. I got a cheeseburger and asked for it to be prepared medium...I received a very dry and very well done bland burger with horrible over cooked yet cold potato wedges. The kids meals are ridiculously small and mediocre at best. To add insult to injury...we paid over $100 for a party of 5 (2 were kids meals) for over cooked and cold food. Huge disappointment!", 
      "The food is solidly mediocre; I certainly wouldn't say \"bad\". \u00a0The beer that they brew, however, is *bad*. \u00a0I don't mean \"bad\" relative to the standards of a self-appointed beer aficionado; just bad. \u00a0I've tried at least a dozen beers on the menu (I live right by this place, so it's been unavoidable), and they are almost all borderline undrinkable. \u00a0There is one that I think is OK, and that I sometimes buy growlers of for parties. \u00a0However, they recently increased the price of a growler of this particular beer *by ten dollars* (the beer is called \"Altercation\"). \u00a0I asked why the price had nearly doubled and the bartender helpfully explained, \"it has more alcohol in it\" and then walked away. \u00a0(I felt like I was being hustled.)I sat kind of stunned, looking at my hands, wondering how my life had reached this point: sitting in a bar, surrounded by televisions, asking myself whether I should tell the bartender that I feel kind of insulted by the new growler price. \u00a0All this for a jug of beer that it would simply be idiotic to claim is better than Red Stripe. \u00a0To the extent that you'd like to encourage Champaign to do better, don't go to this place. \u00a0Big Grove Tavern serves much better food, both Blind Pig locations are far nicer places to drink, the gas stations sell better beer to go, and Esquire has free peanuts if you really need to be in public to watch the Bears play.", 
      "Another fun new restaurant we tried in Champaign! \u00a0My daughter who lives there is moving to Spain so we are letting her choose whenever we go down for football games and she has been picking some winners.This is a sleek, clean, modern space. \u00a0There are beer vats as you enter which add a nice vibe of authenticity. \u00a0We were seated right away at a very comfortable table for the four of us. \u00a0We tried the deviled eggs app and some gingery egg rolls, we all split them and liked them. \u00a0Both had a bit of a kick, the egg roll sauce had the most kick and I found this out after I had drizzled it all over mine but I still enjoyed it immensely, I just drank some extra water.Everyone tried a cup of soup because hey, soup is good food. \u00a0I gobbled up every bit of my beer cheese soup, so light and flavorful. \u00a0I loved it! \u00a0With my swordfish tacos I had an amazing iced tea, it was just a lovely flavorful tea with an orange slice. \u00a0The swordfish tacos were divine but if you are a bit of a spice wimp (like me) you might want the guac on the side, that is where the heat was for sure! \u00a0I ended up just eating the fish out of the taco, it was just too picante for me! \u00a0I adored the rice, bean, corn side dish. \u00a0Just delicious!For dessert, we all split a sour cherry bread pudding and I really liked it. \u00a0It came with ice cream and it was just smooth, sweet and a bit of tangy with that nice cold creamy spot of the ice cream. \u00a0I am not a huge bread pudding fan but I think I could become one!This was a very enjoyable meal. \u00a0The team had played lousy, my daughter is moving, I needed a culinary hug and this was it! \u00a0I would definitely come back but sadly it won't be with my youngest! \u00a0Why don't you meet us so I won't miss her?", 
      "Asked waiter J... If they could make apple martini since it wasnt on their menu... He said absolutely! Well, what was made wasnt apple martini... He explained this after I had taken a sip of it.. Had my boyfriend try it also.. Had it returned.. Ordered something else. Couldnt believe he charged us for it.. He should tell patrons they dont have the right stuff to make drinks that r ordered.Also, food wasnt too bad.. My steak was more well done than medium rare.. Have been here twice.. Last two times was good. This last experience not soo great! They (waiters) need to do a better job with communicating when they r busy! Be consistent with great service n food!", 
      "A lot of people have already said exactly what I think - underwhelming. I've been to Destihl 4 times - the first time, I got the beer-battered cod. WOW! Amazing!! Everything about that experience was great! The past 3 times? Not so much. We always take out-of-town family there, and it's a disappointment. The portions are teeeeeeny tiny, so order plenty of appetizers. The value is not very good at all. The beer's alright. Champaign has better breweries. This restaurant has a lot of potential - it's already showed that. I always go there wanting to be wow'd, and they come up short.", 
      "I was recently invited to Champaign for a grad-school interview, and went out to dinner at Destihl on one of the nights I spent in town. I have to say that I found it very amusing that the priciest restaurant I went to on this trip was also the worst meal of the trip by far.I ordered the goat-cheese pesto pizza, shared the battered asparagus appetizer, and had pint of the brown ale. The battered asparagus was alright but EXTREMELY greasy, the pizza was soggy and surprisingly didn't really taste like basil or goat cheese, and the brown ale was flat out bad (trust me, I drink a lot of microbrew beer, I know what good beer tastes like). Plus, most other people at my table agreed that their food and drinks were also mediocre. Needless to say, since this is an pricier restaurant, I doubt I'd be willing to give Destihl another shot.", 
      "Quickly becoming one of my go-tos, but beer selections are continuing to fall flat. Date night is not quite as enjoyable when my Cab is more manly than the beer the fianc\u00e9 has to drink.", 
      "Hitting the big 5-0-0 with a great restaurant from my hometown!-The vitals:Downtown microbrewery + restaurant with a slightly hip industrial vibe. \u00a0Great food, great beer. \u00a0Best part? \u00a0Small (4oz) tasting portions $1-2. \u00a0GREAT service.-Every time I visit my parents in good ol' Chambana they have a \"new restaurant in town\" that hubby and I MUST try. \u00a0Or five. \u00a0This time, Destihl was first on their list... and they are so crazy about it, they took us twice. \u00a0In ONE DAY.First, for lunch. \u00a0No beer this visit (hence the second), just lunch. \u00a0I had the Portabella Sandwich with Shoestring Fries, and it was 100% delish. \u00a0Also on the table:- Stuffed poblano pepper- Cuban sandwich- Salad with ahi tuna- Clam chowder I heard nothing but raves from the group.Late that evening we stopped in for post-dinner drinks \"and maybe a little to munch on.\" \u00a0We got three appetizers for the table:- Chorizo & Potato Flautas- Marinated Cucumbers (there's some BITE to those suckers!)- Brewmaster's Pizza (yuuuuuumm)... and all got a few 4oz tasting pours. \u00a0The beer was fantastic, some of the best I've had. \u00a0Our waiters both times were friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a good time.One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the story my dad told (more than once) about his friend's first visit. \u00a0They were a big group, 12 I think, and stopping in before seeing a show in downtown. \u00a0They ordered food, drinks, then dessert. \u00a0There was a delay in the kitchen and they were kept waiting on their dessert for quite while... they were now running short on time, so one of the guys flagged down their waiter and told him, maybe a touch rudely, that they \"needed either dessert or the check, because we gotta get out of here.\" \u00a0The manager came back a couple of minutes later, apologized profusely, and served their dessert. \u00a0Dessert or check, and Destihl chose dessert. \u00a0Their meal and drinks for 12 were on the house.It's those kinds of stories that spread your business' name in the best possible way - you chose wisely, Destihl. \u00a0The guy's been sending over everyone he knows, always prompting with \"you gotta hear how amazingly this restaurant treated me!\"", 
      "WOW- I am really surprised by all of the good reviews of this place! \u00a0I have been here twice- both times for lunch. The first time I went with colleagues and two of us ordered soup. It came out cold and had to be sent back. We ordered the cheese curds to share (nothing great) and I had the Chimi Chicken Torta; which was actually pretty bland. The second time I went, I ordered the Tomato and Bread salad with chicken. By the name of the salad, you would think it would have tomatoes on it right? I had two little pieces of a tomato, wilted greens, and a couple little tiny balls of mozzarella. Not acceptable. I asked the waitress for more tomatoes and mozzarella and after looking annoyed, she returned with more of each. I don't know what others are having that's so great, but I am very unimpressed with this place and will not be returning.", 
      "After three dining experiences at Destihl, the biggest complain I have is that they consistently over salt their food. Hey, what's up with that? Lighten up on the soy sauce please! Some of us would like to actually taste our food without leaving with high blood pressure. The Thai chicken wings were salty. The meatloaf was salty and dry. The Thai fried chicken is a good concept, but again it was salty. My chicken was under cooked. The waitress was apologetic and promptly got it re-fried (nice service). Although I didn't get to try them, the burgers and pizzas looked pretty good (but if you're just looking for burgers and pizzas there are much better places). The chocolate cr\u00e8me brulee was a travesty! No resemblance to cr\u00e8me brulee in terms of taste or texture. Extremely unpleasant! However, there is something on the menu that is truly mind blowing! BEER-BATTERED BACON! WOW! So crispy and thick! Must have! Bottom line, if you're here for drinks, order the beer-battered bacon and maybe burgers and pizza. Everything else on the menu is mediocre at best. Oh, and don't forget your blood pressure medication. You'll need it!", 
      "Let me say this: never have I gone to a brew-pub and felt comfortable ordering a burger medium-rare. Destihl has changed all that.Destihl knows what they're doing. Great food, well prepared, attentive and quick service.I would give them 6 stars, but my brother at my leftover half of Kobe burger without asking, and I associate that somewhat traumatic experience with Destihl.", 
      "In my opinion a good brewpub has great beer with good food to accompany the beer. \u00a0Maybe it iwas the fact that we checked it out 4 days after it opened, but of the 5 beer styles we got, 4 of them were \"off\". \u00a0One was clearly oxidized (badly), one was infected to lacto and tasted very funy and the other two mildly oxidized. \u00a0We hoped the manager would come visit with us, but no luck. \u00a0The bartender indicated that depending on the time of day, the beer tastes different from the yeast. \u00a0First time I have heard of that. \u00a0Food was decent, but I have had better pub grub. \u00a0Maybe the beer just ruined my taste buds. \u00a0(Positive) The pizza is HUGE . \u00a0.enough for two to share or one very hungry person.Hopefully they figure things out. \u00a0Have been frequently brewpubs throughout the US in the last 12 years and can honestly say it was the oxidized beer and infect beer were the worse I have ever had. \u00a0Even my earliest botched homebrews were not that \"off\". \u00a0Gave it two stars since it was the first week it was open and the possibilities it was growing pains.", 
      "I was blown away by this oasis of fantastic flavor. \u00a0The grilled stuffed pasta was so mind-bendingly delicious that I tried to recreate this at home. \u00a0While the description and use of two sauces sounds like it would contradict itself, each of the components blend marvelously in your mouth.I sampled soups and small bites as well. \u00a0Over all, I found the flavors in each dish are well balanced and don't compete for attention. \u00a0There is a certain finesse that's being used in the kitchen to render distinctly memorable flavor profiles. \u00a0The atmosphere was inviting, modern and clean. \u00a0The service staff knowledgeable and attentive. \u00a0I wish I had one where I live and will absolutely be back when I find myself in Champaign again."

      "Reading other comments about the high prices here made me chuckle. We felt like Distihl was a great bargain, but since we are from Chicago, our scale is perhaps skewed. Dinner for 6 for $100 made this place fantastic for the price. Granted we were not drinking, but still. The cassoulet was very good, if light on the promised sausage. We will go back next time we are in town.", 
      "Four girls squeezed into a booth. Cue a \"movie\" waiter. My friend named our waiter as someone you would see in a comedy movie or sitcom--talkative, funny-ish, and always popping up at random times for small chat. Needless to say, our server was very attentive (e.g., good at recommending/not recommending dishes, clearing the table). He skated the *annoying* line very closely, never crossed it though so hurrah.Food got thumbs up from us: Med. pizza (really delicious and big for $9), Bison burger (fries were a hit), jambalaya, and dopple chop (it was good, but pricey at $20 for what is received). Drink-wise: Belgian pale ale (ugh, no. a bit of an off-taste), torched cherry caiprissima (too much lime juice for me, but my friend loved it), and don juan (nice). Overall, a good experience. \u00a0But not a place I would have cravings for or feel the need to re-visit. It felt like a safe night-out dinner. Plus you can wear what you'd like, I saw fashions of all kinds without much judgment.", 
      "Okay, first of all, credit where credit is due: There are some delicious appetizers on the menu, and desserts are HUGE and great for splitting. My husband and I have been here a few times, and we both really like the potato croquettes (mmm, chimichurri) and the marinated cucumber salad. Both have a spicy bite -- definitely recommended. The rest of the food is okay. Pizzas are decent, the salads seem to rely a lot on the dressings, similarly so with the sandwiches. Service is good and friendly, although can come down a little on the overwhelmingly chatty side. Still, in a place as big as this one, it's nice to not feel like you've gotten lost or abandoned.Unfortunately, I can't recommend much else. The design and marketing of Destihl gives off a very artisanal vibe, particularly in their choice of \"craft beer,\" but their beers are at best uneven and at worst anemic shadows of what they could be. Most recently, I was disappointed in the pumpkin porter, which sounds like it should be layered and spicy and complex. Mostly, it was bitter and I could only taste the pumpkin if I really thought about it. I've felt similarly about all of their beers that I have tried, although a few are okay (the Hefeweizen, the Tripel). I want to be seduced by the delicious descriptions (and oh, they DO have a good writer), but I just can't.This place reads to me as a large chain that wants to be a small, careful, art-and-ingredient-driven restaurant, but it doesn't get there. It's confusing. 2 1/2 stars, rounding down.", 
      "After a long work day, my friend J and I needed some booze and sustenance... and she came up with yet another Champaign winner!Interior is stylish, minimal and dark. \u00a0Our booth was large and comfy. \u00a0Our waiter was knowledgeable and just friendly enough. \u00a0Can quickly become pricey if you stay a while and dive into the small plates and drinks.I was overwhelmed by the drink menu and ended up going with my old standby, the dirty Martini. \u00a0My first one with organic corn vodka, which made for a smooth sipping drink. \u00a0Loved it. \u00a0J tried two different drinks (so I got to try them too) over the course of our dinner, both of which were delicious and pleasantly spiked with liquor.We tried two different apps - the Beer Battered Bacon and the House Olives (our 2nd choice when we were told they'd just run out of the deviled eggs). \u00a0The bacon was not greasy at all, and the maple chipotle drizzle was the perfect topper. \u00a0The olives were meh, just not necessary - and I don't think my opinion was swayed too much by the fact that I really, really wanted those deviled eggs!Next up, a la carte soup. \u00a0I went with the Beer & Cheddar soup, which was close to great with discernible beer and cheese flavors. \u00a0J chose the soup du jour, Cream of Asparagus - excellent fresh asparagus flavor here. \u00a0Both soups were wonderfully creamy. \u00a0Bowls were decent-sized for $5.My entree was a Thai shrimp and noodle dish (I'm a sucker for coconut curry sauces). \u00a0Nice amount of shrimp, but no noticeable spice to the dish. \u00a0A bit of a disappointment. \u00a0J's beer-brined double pork chop was an amazing dish, not to mention huge. \u00a0Perfectly pink pork.We parked in a nearby parking garage as the lot across the street was full. \u00a0I would return and try everything new (other than my Martini).", 
      "They have good food options. They could work more on the vegetarian options. Nice beer. Some people may like this, but I personally don't like waiters coming back every 10-15 mins asking how the food is and if everything is okay. But I understand that they are trained to do the same.", 
      "I was really excited to try Destihl, but unfortunately the experience fell a little flat. My friend and I arrived a little after 7 on a Friday night and was told the wait would be about 40 minutes since we didn't have reservations. No problem. After only about 20-25 minutes our pager buzzed, so score! So far so good. Our server was really nice and attentive, nothing negative to say about him. However, the food is another story.We started with the cheese curds for an appetizer. And these were awesome, plus they give you a lot. The only part of the meal that really stood out, sadly. I'd had my eye on the strawberry goat cheese salad, so I got that and split the pesto goat cheese pizza. The salad had a lot of potential with all the seemingly good ingredients, but was just off. The spinach tasted wrong and it would have been much better with mixed greens. The \"strawberry\" part of the salad consisted of maybe three tiny pieces and the goat cheese wasn't even very good. It mainly was made up of mandarin oranges and ill-tasting spinach.I'm not a huge fan of wood-fired pizza (I prefer almost any other type of crust). My friend and I split a pizza, but I saw plenty of people putting one away all by themselves. It is very thin. The toppings were ok, but I didn't like how the goat cheese was in big globs instead of spread over the whole pizza.We left without getting dessert, but I saw a few and they are possibly the biggest desserts I've ever seen anywhere. This isn't a good thing. Probably 3-4 people should be splitting on dessert, but I'm guessing that doesn't happen that often. So just be aware if you do order that piece of cake.Besides the service, the other positive is the price. Everything is fairly cheap. But that coincides with the quality, so just beware.", 
      "The Hubster and I decided to do a date night--try out Destihl and then go see The Exorcist at the Virginia (our date night may not be your definition of 'romantic,' but that's neither here nor there). \u00a0I'd heard about how crowded Destihl gets around dinnertime, and never having been there before, I went the AARP-route and reserved a table for us at 5:15 to give ample time for slow service (this was unnecessary). \u00a0I was surprised to learn that Destihl is cavernous. \u00a0There was absolutely no shortage of tables. \u00a0How does it ever get crowded? \u00a0Who knows? \u00a0In any case, we were (irritatingly) seated near the only large, loud party in the entire restaurant. \u00a0Nothing like listening to a bunch of screechy teenagers dressed up for Homecoming say semi-racist things and then shush each other on date night!We got appetizers and small plate-y things to constitute our meal. \u00a0All were finger food, all were messy and delicious. \u00a0We tried the cheese curds (lightly breaded, crunchy, thoroughly melty), thai chicken wings (a nicely spicy slow burn, flavorful, thick sauced with fabulous peanuts sprinkled over the top), and beer-boiled shrimp (a tad too much seasoning that clung to our fingers and overwhelmed most other flavors, not much beer taste, but otherwise...you know...cold shrimp are tasty on their own). \u00a0I tried a pint of their black IPA which I thoroughly enjoyed. \u00a0We also shared their chocolate trio (or M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Trois or whatever they call it), which consisted of mexican hot chocolate (thick, hot, nom), a chocolate tart (delicious filling, but with a crust that was absolutely impossible to cut into, making it awkward to eat, much less share), and zanzibar chocolate ice cream (heaven). \u00a0I need to try more things to be sure that this is actually a problem, but I feel like everything on their menu is too complicated. \u00a0There are SO MANY INGREDIENTS listed on every single menu item. \u00a0Too many seasonings, too many flavor combinations. \u00a0Every time I read something, I was like, \"Mmm...yes...yes...yes!...oh, no, you went too far.\"Our waiter was extremely enthusiastically friendly to the point of making us feel a bit awkward. \u00a0I mean, he hung out and chatted. \u00a0I don't harbor ill will against the guy or anything--he was really nice!--but you know...I'm on a date with my main squeeze...please leave.Considering all the stuff we got, our tab was surprisingly cheap. \u00a0I think we were out for under $30. \u00a0I waffled between 3.5 and 4 stars, but I'm feeling generous today.", 
      "Occasionally, very rarely if truth be told, one finds oneself in Champaign, home of University of Illnois at Urbana-Champaign Campus and gateway to the high plains. It is one of those lovely little Midwestern university towns where one could spend a nice life far from the cut and thrust of city life. When in Champaign, one could do worse than to eat at Destihl. The place is modern brew pub of the sort that was popular in the late 90s in fleshpots like San Francisco. Get their flight, it is quite good. The Amber is sweet and floral. They serve nice gastro pub fare. I had the fish (of some sort) that was quite nice. Mid-west prices. Sit on the corner patio in front of Destihl, sipping their beer and watching the sunset on downtown Champagne. Good times.(Whew! So snobby!)", 
      "Destihl is an upscale pub-style restaurant with a low key atmosphere. \u00a0The menu is quite large and has a lot of variety from small tapas style plates, to salads, pizzas, burgers, steaks, entrees, and even some thai-fusion style dishes. \u00a0Because of the variety, I think this is a great place to bring a group or a date if you're not sure what type of food they prefer. \u00a0The beer is all brewed at Destihl and is decent, but I've never been blown away by any of their brews. \u00a0I have been here several times and my favorite dish so far was the Cedar Plank Salmon. On my most recent trip I ordered the Kobe Burger and when I ran out of sauce, the server asked if I would like more. \u00a0 I am not a dessert person, but I LOVE their dessert menu. \u00a0So, do yourself a favor and save room for dessert!Be warned, if you sit in the bar area be prepared to wait. I have actually left a few times when I haven't been given water or a menu 15 minutes after arriving. \u00a0If you sit in the main dining room however, the service is superb.", 
      "Destihl-ness is the move! They've only been open a few weeks but I'm predicting that this place is going to become an institution here in Champaign-Urbana. They're not quite there yet, BUT this four stars is partially based on potential. I don't know if that's acceptable for Yelp, but whatever.I will admit I got a little gluttonous this evening. Ideally, I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did, but it was what it was. I started off with some of the home brews. I did the the little 4 oz guys and out of the four I tried, I liked three enough to drink again (the Belgian ale was a bit too hoppy for my liking). At $1.25 each (or $5 for the 4), I don't mind one I didn't like.Next I went with the beer-cheese soup. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT. It was amazingly good. Also, at my table were some cheese curds and I will dare say that these curds were the finest curds I have ever eaten (and I've had them in Wisconsin too). For my entree, I went with the bison burger which was flavorful - although I will echo the review who noted that their meat was overcooked - and I appreciated that fries were included. The fries were awesome - shoestring style and were not oversalted, but weren't seasoned improperly either (just right!).For dessert it was baked apples with butter pecan ice cream. It was wildly decadent and irresponsibly delicious. The service is not awful but you can tell that the servers are still getting their feet wet. No worries though. The food was totes worth the wait. I'll be back no doubt and I'm pretty sure I'll be updating with 5 stars.", 
      "Beer is pretty good. \u00a0 I'm not normally impressed with the offerings of small brewpubs, but this place is OK. \u00a0 Liked every beer I was served.Appetizers were good. \u00a0 I enjoyed the bacon-wrapped dates.Things fell apart a bit when it came to our main meal. \u00a0 My hamburger was overcooked and uninteresting. \u00a0 No condiments for my sandwich. \u00a0 And waitstaff sorta evaporated once our food was delivered.This is a restaurant I would visit to sit at the bar and enjoy beer and snacks. \u00a0 But for lunch or dinner, I'd take my meal elsewhere.", 
      "3.5 for food4.5 for drinksDestihl seems to have all the right ingredients to become THE hot spot downtown, but I didn't leave it feeling like I really want to come back. Service was very slow, but since it's the first weekend of operation, I'm not going to take any points off. The decor was really nice, cosy, and even a little cosmopolitan. I got the pesto chicken pasta which I thought was good, but nothing to get excited about. I tried the fried cheese appertiser, and while good, they also weren't anything to write home about. Overall, food was good, but not great. There are better restaurants elsewhere.The drinks, on the other hand, were good AND also reasonably priced which I did not expect. They had a big beer, wine, cocktail, and martini menu. I tried a couple of different beers, and they were all really good for the most part. They also had 4 oz portion which was a great way to try different beers, and the 4 oz portion is surprisingly not priced proportionally any higher than its 12 oz counter part. Destihl seems like the ideal place to get dinner before a night downtown. Great ambient, great location, great drinks, and good food. Even though it's not anywhere near there yet, I'm sure that it has the potential to be the best place in a couple of months.", 
      "FINALLY! We were all being teased for so long about when it would actually open! I went it's opening weekend and let me be clear when I say this rating is based on beers alone, I didn't get a chance to try the food yet!I'll start by saying that the atmosphere is really cool. It reminds me of a Blind Pig Brewery meets Seven Saints or something like that. They call themselves a gastro-brewery instead of a gastro-pub, which I think fits the bill pretty well. The place is divided up nicely with the bar being it's own area and a nicer looking restaurant on the other side. I have to say though, I was a bit surprised to hear that it's only open until 11, that doesn't seem wise for an area of town that's so reliant on the nightlife.As far as the beer goes, they had 18 on tap that were freshly made on the spot and they were pretty amazing. I was surprised to hear that they didn't have anything but their own brews available, and I worried about how my non-fancy beer fans felt, but then when I tasted their Champaign Blonde Ale, it was EXACTLY like a Bud Light. I think my favorite that I sampled was the Downstate Pale Ale, and the Raspberry Wheat Ale was a bit too much for me. But overall, I think they covered their bases pretty well.I definitely can't wait to come back and try the food (which I hear is truuuuly delicious) and give this place it's 5th and final star!UPDATE!So I went back and finally got to try the food. I believe I ordered the Swordfish, my boyfriend got the jambalaya and we both split some of the beer battered asparagus. I'll say right away the asparagus was the best part, which didn't surprise me because everyone raved about their appetizers, but I never heard much about the main dishes. My swordfish wasn't that great, to be honest, and I'm pretty easy to please. My boyfriend's jambalaya wasn't superb either, but then again, that's probably not the best thing to order at a place like this.All in all, everything was good, and a nice change from what's available downtown, but if I had one piece of advice, it would be stick to the beer and small plates!", 
      "Huge fan of this place! \u00a0My fiance and I made last minute reservations here on Christmas Eve...we had a GREAT waitress, can't remember her name...who understood we wanted to move quick so we could catch Mission Impossible (which would only get about 2 stars, by the way).We ordered the flat bread (I'm obsessed with truffle oil), one of their specialty pizzas and a Greek salad to share. \u00a0We were impressed with ALL of it. \u00a0Flat bread was good if you're in the mood for starchy foods--the pizza had a very thin crust, which I loved, so you could eat more of the toppings...and the salad was HUGE for its small price.We tasted several of the beers and ended up getting a growler to go because we loved it so much.Decor was a bit industrial, and very contemporary, especially for the Midwest. \u00a0We will definitely return and bring friends!", 
      "Super excited this place is finally open. \u00a0Not only that, but it was just as good as I had hoped it would be. \u00a0Tons of good things to say about the place, but I'll start with the two negatives so we can get that out of the way.The waitress heard me say cheese pizza instead of goat cheese pizza. \u00a0Probably my fault actually, because it was loud and I am a self-proclaimed mumbler. \u00a0This mistake was fixed promptly and the pesto goat cheese pizza was awesome. \u00a0Second problem was that the fried asparagus was somewhat whelming. \u00a0It was really big, so if you're going for size great, but smaller spears aren't woody textured like the big spears. \u00a0I assume that since they specify they use local when they can, that this problem will remedy itself once asparagus comes into season in a few weeks around here.Now for the mega good stuff:Deadhead double red is probably THE BEST red ale I've ever had. \u00a0It is strong, spicy, flavorful and full bodied. \u00a0Just wonderful! \u00a0Everyone at my table liked their other flavors (and we went with some beer snobs ;) \u00a0The hubby loved, loved, loved the coffee glazed rib-eye. \u00a0Service was surprisingly good granted that it was the first weekend they were open. \u00a0The people getting bad service in the other review...sorry, we must've been hogging all the attention ;). \u00a0We actually liked the place so much we went back for brunch on the next day. \u00a0Which was even. more. amazing.Ordered the swordfish tacos (see pics) and Cuban sandwich, and the french toast (see pics) for the munchkin. \u00a0The kids French toast was ridiculously awesome. \u00a0Here's the most awesome kicker- we were with a big group with 4 kids and the back room was open, so they gave it to us to have our brunch back there so the kids wouldn't bother anyone else. \u00a0It was an awesome experience and the whole staff was soooo super nice. \u00a0Make sure to check out my food pics- the kids meal was 1/3 eaten when I took the pic, but you can imagine the thrill in junior's eyes when he saw what he got for breakfast! :)Awesome place guys! \u00a0Keep up the good work!", 
      "Great restaurant! I have been here twice now and enjoyed everything I've had. Visit #1: Tried a few beers before selecting one. The drafts come in three sizes, which is really nice. My friends and I got the pretzels with cheese and mustard dipping sauces, and LOVED them. I got the bison burger with fries and had to stop myself from eating the whole thing before my stomach exploded! Great wait staff and a very classy atmosphere.Visit #2: Another great beer experience. Got a pizza this time, which was pleasantly adequate for a one person dinner. It was thin and crispy, but not crunchy...just the way I like it! We sat at a window near the bar and watched downtown during sunset, which was really nice. I like the corner location...lots of natural light!Will definitely consider coming here whenever I want to eat downtown. Reasonably priced for the quality, and a great overall dining experience.", 
      "Utterly fantastic food. \u00a0The chef is a genious on par with any of the best restaurants in town, but at a lower price than some of the more expensive competition. \u00a0Not as nice of an atmosphere as some of the fine-dining restaruants like Jim Gould's and Silvercreek, but every bit as tasty. \u00a0Destihl is going to have a great impact on downtown.Also, while I'm not a beer person, the people I ate with said the beer is an excellent local micro-brew. \u00a0Perhaps not amazing, but just as much as any reasonable person could hope for.Also, they do have a meeting/conference room with a large table and an LCD TV.", 
      "My family and I absolutely LOVE Destihl! \u00a0It has become the go-to place whenever my parents visit (I am in law school).The first time we went there, I was pleasantly surprised to see how many options were available for myself because I am an ovo-lacto vegetarian. \u00a0Usually I have to settle for something bland or uninteresting, but Destihl has lots of imaginative and delicious options. \u00a0We started with the beer-battered asparagus which was pretty tasty. \u00a0I ordered the stuffed pablano which was absolutely amazing. \u00a0It was spicy and had a really interesting mix of flavors. \u00a0My mom got the Thai fried chicken and my dad got the ribeye, which they both loved. \u00a0My boyfriend got the bison burger which he thought was good but not as amazing as our dishes. \u00a0The second time we went was for lunch. \u00a0I got the lunch combo with the portabella and brie sandwich and the beer and cheddar soup. \u00a0The sandwich was yummy but the soup was really very delicious. \u00a0Definitely comfort food and really hit the spot. \u00a0My mom got the Thai fried chicken again and my dad got the Thai steak which he said was even better than the ribeye. \u00a0My boyfriend ordered the Dijon chicken which he really enjoyed.You should probably make a reservation for dinner but likely do not need one for lunch. \u00a0They also serve brunch on the weekends until 2:00 and those items looked pretty delicious as well. \u00a0We have had great servers at Destihl and the restaurant has a nice ambiance. \u00a0Plus, they don't have a corkage fee! \u00a0The first time we went, we brought our own bottle of wine and there was no charge! \u00a0All in all we have had really great meals here and will definitely be returning!", 
      "I have gone multiple times and my parents pretty much live here. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable on what they have and they are super friendly! I love trying new things and I am never disappointed. My dad has helped them with a batch of beer, they have made Reese's vodka just for my mom and honestly, whenever I go with them to eat it's like I walk onto the set of Cheers. Everybody knows their name. But you don't have to be a regular to feel like you're getting special treatment. I love that they bring you samples of their beer or tell you what just became available after aging. I love the location, I love the feel... I just wish I had more money so I could visit them more often!", 
      "Passing through town and stopped in Champaign for the night. This place was recommended to me by the front desk clerks at my hotel. If you are a craft beer enthusiast you should definitely stop in. It is definitely worth the short drive even if you are staying by the highway in Motel Hell. I arrived early and was seated promptly at a table in view of a big screen TV near the bar area. My server was knowledgable and attentive. I had a flight of three craft beers, guided by my server. As an appetizer, I had the mac and cheese. Loved it and managed to avoid eating it all so I could take some back to my room. For an entree, I had the salmon over a bed of roasted vegetables. This was also quite good. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse, which is accented by a topping of cinnamon-coated maple bacon (amazing) and mint. This was also good but could be more chocolatey, IMHO. If I lived in the area I would dine here regularly. If you are a visitor, do yourself a favor and avoid the generic chain places by the highway, and drive into town to go here instead.", 
      "OK, if it wasn't for the weird service we experienced, this would totally be 5 stars. At first, our server spent a lot of us time with us going over all the different beers and was super knowledgeable and basically just a really good server. Halfway into dinner he disappeared and other people started bringing us our food. When we asked where he was, we were told that he was in the \u00a0back doing other things. At the end of dinner he returned to being our server but also bartender so we were basically ignored. Very weird service.We tried 11 of the 14 beers they make. I personally like really hoppy beers, but alas I can't remember the names of the ones I liked. For appetizers we ordered the chorizo stuffed dates, which were AMAZING! We also ordered lamb meatballs. I love anything with goat cheese so both of these appetizers were right up my alley. In the past, I have also gotten beer battered asparagus which is also super delicious.Originally, I ordered the pesto and goat cheese pizza but unfortunately it was very soggy and my plate was drenched in grease. Even the server commented that it was excessively soggy. I sent it back, which is something I NEVER do. I then ordered the flat iron quesadillas from the appetizers as my dinner. It didn't disappoint. My favorite part was definitely the chorizo stuffed dates.", 
      "I've been here a few times. \u00a0I like it for lunch. \u00a0 Their beer is alright. \u00a0The flatbread-y pizza with lemon and arugula was delicious. \u00a0I have it on good authority that their portobello sandwich is better than \u00a0The Bread Company. I think the dinner - both the crowds and the food - are a little pretentious. \u00a0My BF thinks that this is \"a great place for women who shop at Chicos to meet up with each other and discuss the braided leather belts they bought for their husbands.\" \u00a0Which is to say, he thinks they overdo atmosphere to keep the rif raff out. \u00a0In my experience, I will sacrifice dim lighting for a chile that is actually spicy. \u00a0Oh, midwestern restaurants. \u00a0Are you using bell peppers to make Chile Rellenos? \u00a0My littlest brother really liked it, though. \u00a0He devoured some friend bacon appetizer.", 
      "Went here for din-din with my broey and his wifepoo since they live in the area. \u00a0Food was fantastic! \u00a0Service was spot on - our waitress was very attentive and took great care of us.We had a flight of the many beers they offer, the menu is extensive and it's hard to decide. \u00a0But one thing is 1000% worth getting: \u00a0Beer Battered Asparagus. \u00a0That's it. \u00a0Who cares if you have stinky pee from eating asparagus - totally worth it.", 
      "OK so each time I have gone back to Destihl since my original post it has been better. I'd like to think someone over there read my posts ;) I'm still not a fan of the price points but the food is far more consistent and seems to be better quality. Also really enjoy their coffee and fresh cream after any meal there. Still nothing terribly interesting however everything seems fresh and well executed. Also I am trying to tone down on being such a food snob so... 4 stars!! (throws confetti sarcastically)", 
      "I've been to Desthil a couple times, and it's pretty nice. The burgers are really good, as are the Cuban sandwiches. I was also fond of the house drafts that I tried (including an apricot beer that's one of my favorite Belgians). The beers they brew onsite are all really good. The dessert menu is also fantastic- try the chocolate cake that's the size of your head if you're looking for diabetes. The Smores plate is also fun.All that said, the food here is a bit more expensive than it's worth. Burgers are cheaper (and better) at Farren's, Radio Maria has better Cubans for the price and the entrees are nothing too impressive- good, but not great. I've also found service to be a bit hit or miss- we've had waiters that have been remarkably friendly and courteous, but last time they substituted a more expensive glass of wine for one they apparently didn't have without telling us. I like going here, and it's a nice change of pace every once in a while, but rarely do I go \"Boy, we need to go to Desthil.\"", 
      "All right, so I've now been to both locations of Destihl and I have to say they're both pretty good, not stellar but a slightly above average brewpub. I tried their Hawaii five ale which was okay-it was a fruit beer that was supposed to remind me of being on a beach in Hawaii. Well, anything is possible it was a tarter beer but still a very light ale. They didn't have their dunkelweizen here which was disappointing. I got hungry waiting for my friend so I ordered the Ancho chips and dip. The chips were just okay but the vinegar and the dressings were really quite good. The habanero vinegar wasn't overpoweringly hot but had a nice kick and the ranch was more than just a ranch dressing. I had the bison burger because I haven't had bison meat in a while and it was just as good. The burger though, was all right the bison, slightly sweeter and less greasy than ground beef was good. The dressing on it though took away from the flavor of the meat \u00a0but the fries were actually quite tasty. \u00a0Overall, it's still an okay place", 
      "This is become one of my favorite places to dine in Champaign. Good prices, consistent cooking, good service, and not too busy on Sunday mornings. I noticed some people complained about the prices, but for the quality of food, this is really much cheaper than something comparable in the Chicago suburbs although the portions aren't exactly huge. But it's pretty in line with prices and portion sizes at other restaurants in downtown. The menu is quite unique for the area and similar to what you'd find in a lot of Milwaukee restaurants.I really enjoyed everything from the American Kobe burger to the Beer-battered cod. The textures and variety of flavors were great and not too salty. The sandwiches and soups were also pretty light and refreshing. I particularly enjoyed the tomato soup and corn & chicken chowder soups. The dessert choices were quite varied but i was so full I didn't have room for more than one. The stout ice cream sandwiches had a really nice stout ice cream between brownie circles. It was a perfect way to end the meal.Given the quality of cooking and good prices, I'll definitely be back here soon.Update: Upon visiting a few more times, I still think this is a good restaurants but there are a couple notes.The price complaints I see from some reviews may be due to the varying sizes of some dishes. For example, the thai mussels appetizer is quite a bit smaller than some other items although the prices are similar. Also, the chocolate cake is a giant portion compared to the bread pudding.I'm not a big fan of anything Asian themed I tried here as I found the flavors to be too strong. I prefer it to be more delicate although some patrons may appreciate the bold flavors. I wasn't a big fan of the pizzas either. They were large in size but the dough was too moist for me and I didn't like the flavor combinations I tried.I did like the teas I tried as they were high quality organic tea bags. The coffee is a mix of two Kenyan coffees with a full bodied flavor from their supplier in Bloomington served with fresh cream. The shrimp frittata comes with a generous amount of shrimp flavored with shrimp stock, probably the best frittata I've ever eaten. The cuban style pork sandwich was done well but not as legendary as other reviewers make it out to be. The Potts roast was also done well but not worth a special note. The potato crusted rainbow trout was done well with good presentation but I wish the portion size could have been a little larger. The dijon chicken was moist and flavored well but, the real star of the dish was the asparagus that was cooked and flavored excellently.The apple fritters dessert had crispy fritters but the toughness of the peel wasn't that appealing. If it were substituted with something like apple chips or churros, I probably would have enjoyed it more. If the goal is to keep an apple-like look, possibly fried colored dough is a better substitute. The chocolate cake is a whole pound with chocolate layering instead of cream. This was done well and not overly sweet, a very good choice for chocolate lovers. \u00a0The sour cherry bread pudding was done well, a little too sour for me but a solid choice. I would've preferred a couple elements to vary the texture inside but that might not fit the overall theme of the dish.", 
      "I love the Destihl in Bloomington-Normal so I had to give this one a try. \u00a0A co-worker and I came here for dinner on a Thursday night. \u00a0The place was not overly busy but had plenty of business. \u00a0I really liked the decor of the place and the booth setup was neat. \u00a0Our waitress was very helpful and friendly.I was happy to see that they have the same menu as the one in Bloomington-Normal with only their beer selection being different. \u00a0We started with the Beer Battered Asparagus which was delicious! \u00a0I was tempted to get my usual, the White Cheddar Stuffed Poblano Peppers but decided to change it up a bit. \u00a0I went with the Potato Crusted Rainbow Trout. \u00a0It had wonderful flavor! \u00a0My co-worker got my usual and she loved them too. \u00a0We decided to go for dessert as well. \u00a0I ordered the Creme Brulee. \u00a0I was not very impressed by this. \u00a0It was a bit on the runny side and I am used to creme brulee being smooth and creamy.Overall, great food and service! \u00a0Love this place!", 
      "Man, Champaign (my hometown) now has two brewpubs within a block of each other. Houston (where I live now) has none. Why can't the 4th largest city in the US have a brewpub? I digress.There is a sterile and industrial atmosphere here. One that I am seeing in more in more bars, and I am not a fan. The style does not work here looks like the pub and owners are being cheep. \u00a0Seems cold to me. The bar is to the left with some tables and booths. To the right on the Neil St side is another dinning area. The brewing equipment can be seen from the Church St side. A few TV's above the bar, but unintrusive. Relaxed, but sterile and pretty much the exact opposite of the Blind Pig. Which oozes uniqueness from every wood poor.The service is fast, but they are not very interested in much. I want someone working at a brewpub to at least show interest in their products. Here it seems they want to shuffle you in and out with a ticket and some tips. Unimpressed on this front. The food is fairly bland and generic. Some pizzas, some steaks, some chicken, some seafood. A little of everything. They do nothing good, but nothing bad either.There is a wide variety of beers available. Including a cask mild, which I would have jumped at if I had seen it before leaving. The rest is about 14 taps in all styles. A blonde, hefeweizen, a scotch ale, a few stouts and IPAs (some imperial), lots of Belgian styles. \u00a0Though nothing is really that good, and some have obvious flaws.Overall, clearly the second best brewpub on the block. Almost the definition of average to me. The food does not really excite me either. I really can't see myself coming here to often over the many other great beer destinations and restaurants within walking distance. Though cheers for at least another brewpub option in town.", 
      "Tried it again after awhile and boy have the portions gotten smaller and still as expensive. I will totally pay for it if it's worth it but I don't think it is. I think it only gets good ratings bc there isn't much to choose from here in c/u along these lines. Also the atmosphere is nice and beer is pretty good for being able to order the small ones to try more. But yeah, won't be back.", 
      "Not too crowded at 12am on a weekend.Found a table, whew, and the waiter was very helpful. \u00a0He knew quite a bit about drinks, their beers, and the menu.He was attentive and answered all our questions patiently. \u00a0Patience is a virtue to a bar customer because time is money for them, and I get that.The only thing I remember ordering was the deep fried bacon. \u00a0MMMMMMMM \u00a0It had a bit of spice to it and they were great...just taxing on the tummy 30 minutes after eating it. \u00a0Sooooo much grease - but aren't things better that way?Lots of interesting menu choices and in house brewed beers (which I didn't have)Hope you try them.", 
      "My teammate and I had two delicious dinners here. We loved the \"bacon egg and cheese\" deviled eggs. I enjoyed, on separate occasions, the chipotle chicken sandwich (good sweet potato fries) and the grilled and stuffed. I also sampled my teammate's meat loaf; that tasted incredible as well. I loved my cocktails, which include the Vanilla and Mint, Dark and Stormy, and the Aztec Chocolate. The last one was amazing - it had a spicy kick to it. The atmosphere and service were incredible as well. If in town again I would make it a point to return here.", 
      "The place looks great and I love the beer. The food looks great but it doesnt taste great.... it's usually overly salted. like calm down with the salt shaker.I like that they offer $2 mini beers so that you can try multiple. That's a-okay in my book. one last thing... what's up with the waiters? ALL of them! They've all got the personalities of awkward engineers. \u00a0I actually was so certain our waiter was an awkward engineer that I asked him if he was a student at U of I. \u00a0Imagine my surprise when he said he studied library sciences. WAAAAH?Anyways, moderate place for food, good place for beer, awkward but polite service.", 
      "Destihl was something that was completely unexpected for me to find in downtown Champaign. It was a MUCH bigger place than I anticipated, and I would love to see it on a day when it was busy. We were there about 3pm on a Monday. I was immediately impressed with the vibe of the place - very hip, and something you would expect to find in any major city's downtown. The beer list was posted on a board above the bar and was HUGE for a local microbrewery. Where I expected to find 8-10 local beers supported by a smattering of other regional brews, the list of beers brewed in house was closer to 20-25. As I had never been to Destihl, I asked the bartender to select 4 beers for me to sample (this is typical practice for me -- a good bartender will ask the right questions and figure out what you like). He started by asking if I wanted darker or lighter beer, and then asked me about some different flavor profiles. \u00a0After a few questions, he came back with four delicious beers. \u00a0I tried the Roadblock British Red Ale, Black Angel Stout, Deadhead Double Red, and Antiquity Rye Wine. \u00a0All were really awesome.I was very pleased with the bartenders knowledge of the beer, the fast friendly service, and the atmosphere in general.Next time I'm in town this is DEFINITELY a place I plan to return, and hopefully next time I'll get to order some food as well.", 
      "I had heard about this place about 6 months before I tried it out, and I'm mad at myself for missing out for so long. The food is affordable for a student on a budget, and the atmosphere is perfect for a date or group outing. It's the perfect place for students to bring their visiting parents, too.The beer comes in sizes ranging from 4oz to 16oz, so you can try different brews if you're in the mood for that. The Tomato & Bread salad is absolutely phenomenal, and I have added chicken to it and had that as my entree on more than one occasion. This is one restaurant I really miss since graduating U of I and leaving the area.", 
      "The first time I went to Destihl, I sat in the dining room; things were okay. \u00a0The next time, and every time since, I have sat at the bar; things were remarkable. \u00a0I enjoy having the direct interaction with the team of wonderfully skilled bartenders. \u00a0Their attention to detail and good cheer make the bar a must for anyone I take out in Champaign. \u00a0The roasted peanuts covered in delectable spices and drizzled with fresh lime juice make the perfect accoutrement to the always great, fresh beer; the bbq burger is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.", 
      "We've been to Destihl maybe six times now, for brunch, lunch, and dinner. Most of the food is very good, better conceived and made than a lot of other area restaurants offer. Portions are fairly generous (not so much with brunch items), and the price fits the quality of ingredients and preparation. The staffing is good, service is timely, and the decor is charming. The craft beers made on site are wonderful. Try a series of 4 ouncers to build your own tasting. The flavor profiles given on the brew menu seem so far to have been accurate.For appetizers, I recommend the shrimp ceviche (technically a \"small plate\") and the stone oven pretzels (you get two, with cheese and spicy honey mustard dips). I've tried one soup, the corn and chicken chowder, which was very good, nice SW pepper flavor without overwhelming the chicken. We've had sandwiches and entrees, from burgers to steak, and it's all been really delicious. The food is in the American Contemporary Casual style -- better than Houlihan's at the i-Hotel in our opinion.The only bad experience we've had with the food has been the cedar plank brie dessert. It was badly prepared (the brie wasn't even room temperature) and either the recipe was off or the honey-chili sauce was made incorrectly, because it was completely unbalanced and unpalatable. The smoke flavor reacted poorly with what was on the plank, too. We took the brie home (a big piece) and cut off the rind to eat the middle later, but it still tasted of rank sauce and smoke. We did not go back to the restaurant for a couple of months because of just how bad this was. \u00a0I wrote the general manager and he was good about it, offering to review the recipe and preparation with the lead chef. Since returning to Destihl, we've had good experiences again -- the place is consistent, a fun place to socialize, and a nice addition to CU's restaurant scene.", 
      "I have been there twice till now and I am amazed at how classy a brewery's restaurant can be in a college town! They have few of the best appetizers I have had and certainly the best in the urbana-champaign area. They profess their best appetizer are the cheese curds (which are good) but the best of the lot has to be the Potato croquettes. I have had the beer-battered asparagus as well which changed my taste buds liking towards asparagus! I am a vegetarian and its extremely difficult to find a good vegetarian burger, so i was skeptical to order that (most places have burnt, bitter black bean patty!!) but they had one of the biggest veggie burger I have seen. The patty had rice, carrots, ginger and a few other veggies blended with the beans making it really delicious filling. The only vegetarian entree they have is the Stuffed Poblano Peppers, which was excellent. The staff is extremely courteous (sometimes more so than needed) and are very keen to entertain you. A few negatives are, the beer selection is great but is limited. I expect a brewery to have all their beers available (except the seasonal's, obviously) but they seem to rotate their beer. Even though the beer tastes good, I would cut some points for the spread of it. Another thing would be the place is unable to substitute any of the meat based dish with a vegetarian option which is a turn off if you are a vegetarian. P.S. Make a reservation, it is usually crowded!", 
      "I had 2 different beers; they were both pretty good. I ordered the mussels. Over half were not open. I sent them back. Second time about 5 were not open (not acceptable to me). The broth was good, however. I also had the pepperoni pizza. It was decent. My bf got the cod, it was very tasty. Next time, I will probably try an entree. It was very busy when we went, but we sat in the bar. Service was good.", 
      "I'm a beer nerd, and I'm disappointed by this place so far. I plan to give it more chances, but I've tried the brown ale, Belgian single, a kolsch, and a pale ale, and have been relatively uninspired by nearly all of them.The website lists some hoppier alternatives, but I haven't seen them actually on the menu."

      "I really wanted to like this place. The location is nice and the tables are spacious. It can be both informal or formal and the seating and decor are mellow. The service was very good and our server Aaron was excellent. However....the food is another story.We started with an appetizer that was fine but our meals were terrible. My date ordered the dijon chicken and it was incredibly dry and also came with TWO HAIRS in it! \u00a0My kobe burger was also very dry and unexciting. The bun was stale and the beef was extremely dry and tasteless. For dessert we ordered \u00a0a large chocolate cake that was $11. It was okay, but nothing exciting.I'm not a food snob but for the money I would expect a lot more. Sorry to say that this was my first and last experience at Destihl. I hope others have a more favorable experience.", 
      "Having heard and read so many different views on Destihl, I was looking forward to being part of a group dinner tonight. My group of 12 was immediately seated and drink orders were quickly taken. Service was interesting. Although our waiter was excellent, there seemed to be several uncertainties when drinks and food were brought to the table. Things got to where they needed to be, but I was surprised there seemed to be so much trouble just getting the orders to the correct guests.The food was wonderful! We had some excellent shared appetizers -- beer-battered asparagus, stone oven pretzels and beer-battered bacon. I had the Greekish salad and the cedar plank salmon. My wife had bacon & brussels and roasted beet salad. Others had a variety of chicken, seafood and meat entrees. For dessert my wife and I shared the chocolate cake.I tried a few of the four ounce beer samples and had a bloody mary. The beer was very good, the bloody mary excellent in presentation but only average in taste.We were not expecting to spend almost three hours having a leisurely dinner, but the evening was very nice. I was impressed with the general vibe for a Saturday night.All in all, I was impressed with Destihl and will definitely come back to try lunch or perhaps dinner with my wife or a smaller group.", 
      "This is kind of a go-to place with out-of-town relatives, the food is good if overpriced. Some dishes meh but i like the fish and chips. \u00a0Beer ok better than your low end brews. Nicely decorated service generally good.", 
      "I'm so disappointed. I'm in champaign visiting my sister, and a friend of ours recommended we go to Destihl. He touted it as a gift from the gods. Like so good hat he went there for lunch and dinner one day and then came back for brunch the next morning. After looking at the menu, how could I resist??So we went today for a late lunch (around 2:30) and found the place pretty much deserted. There were some people working in the bar who made eye contact with us but didn't come up to the host stand to seat us. So we waited. And waited. And finally a hostess came and brought us to a cavernous booth in the bar. Where we waited. And waited. And listened to awful terrible music (read: Dave Matthews Band)A female server came to get our drink orders and informed us that Michael would be our server. Ok, so the do team service, I'm on board with that. But Michael didn't come with our drinks. Someone dressed like a manager did. And Michael didn't take our food order. A woman who we later learned was a manager did. I think Michael maybe refilled our drinks? The first manager looking guy dropped off our apps. Here's the skinny on what we had:Beer battered bacon: this is worth a star. It was greasy but oddly delicious. Brussels sprouts: flavor was good but they were still pretty hard in the middle. Bacon Egg and Cheese Deviled Eggs: nothing to write home about. They were small and pretty smoky tasting.  For entrees, I ordered the fried egg BLT and my sister ordered the bison burger. My BLT was fine. Again, nothing to write home about. There was some sort of mustardy vinaigrette on the greens that was overpowering. And the egg could have been runnier. But another star goes to the fries which were hot and crispy and delicious. My sister ordered her burger medium and it came out completely well done. Like \"we think this bison is dead but let's burn it at the stake just to make sure it's really really dead.\" She decided to send it back and so we waited. And waited. And a brand new server (still not Michael) came by to check on us. She went back to the kitchen to have them make a new burger and left the old one so my sis could nibble on the fries. Her friendly attitude and apologies would have garnered another star, but I was SO put off when she came back to tell us that her manager wanted to let us know that she put the order in correctly and that the cooks are the ones who screwed up. Umm... Why wouldn't the manager come over herself to apologize? Or at least to check on us after the replacement came? And also, it is so not cool to throw your kitchen staff under the bus like that. All in all, Destihl has good bacon, inattentive staff, poor leadership, and too much desire to be \"cool.\" And where is Michael? My receipt says he was my server but I don't even know if I saw him, and I fear my tip went to someone who didn't do any work! I won't be back.", 
      "I came here a handful of times during my 5 years in Chambana and had a great experience almost every time. They have some fantastic dishes - the swordfish is AWESOME, the beer battered asparagus is enormous, the burgers are great and the desserts are intense. The drinks are good too. I brought many different people here and they all had a great time too. I think the one dish that was unanimously disliked was the bleu cheese quesadilla thing. TOO MUCH BLEU CHEESE. It's a great location for groups and the service always seemed to be timely and personable. Would definitely go again if I traveled down that way more often.", 
      "Our waiter was really nice, but the food was just OK this time. Unfortunately they did not have the Asian chicken wings or Cherry French Toast on the menu that we really enjoyed the last time we ate there. We went there for lunch & I ordered a Thai steak salad. The steak was overcooked in chunks & there were only a few slices of steak. The dressing was sour & just OK. The rest of my family ordered the beer battered bacon app which they loved. My son enjoys the pork sandwich. Their house made chips & chocolate cake are very good.", 
      "good food, small portions. \u00a0Fairly over priced for what you get. \u00a0A little on the gourmet side as well.All in all, i'd like to try more on the menu, i had the bbq glazed chicken and it was good, not great, thus only 3 stars for Distihl.Would love to see some blackened items added to the menu, like a fish or a chicken.",

      "Destihl is my go to place for a nice meal in Champaign, The environment is great. this is a must go for couples looking for a nice date. Their draft selection is great (obviously with a huge brewery inside the restaurant) they let you sample a few beers to try out what you like and they have awesome mixed drinks as well. I love their bloody mary (comes with salami, pickles, celery etc) its amazing (I love the spicy-ness of it). Honestly, the food was just okay. I've gotten this asian-ish dish before, a burger (eggs, bacon, wagyu beef) but i would much prefer Farren's, and appetizers. So yeah food is not too special but the drinks are good, waitresses are friendly (Michelle is AMAZING), and dessert is delicious. So honestly, I would come here (sit at the bar) get a few appetizers, drinks, and dessert.",

The appetizers were so-so. \u00a0We tried potato croquettes and beer battered bacon. \u00a0The croquettes were run-of-the-mill, but good nonetheless. \u00a0The bacon was interesting, but certainly not a taste sensation.The main course were pretty variable. \u00a0My wife ordered the shrimp and grits - which was far too overpriced for such a meager portion. \u00a0Though, it was fairly tasty. \u00a0I ordered a Brewmaster's pizza which was very good.The main reason Destihl loses a star is the speed with which we received our drinks order. \u00a0It must have taken about 15 minutes after ordering for us to receive our drinks. \u00a0Eventually, we were informed of the backup at the bar. \u00a0I expect better though.Also, unrelated to my rating, there appeared to be a large number of employees standing around at the greeting station watching other employees working. \u00a0This could be training, then again, it could be the reason some of the food items are so expensive for the product!", 
      "This is a cute place in the downtown area of Champaign. It is always busy on the weekends and the service is good. My only issue was that the menu was kind of all over the place. There was traditional bar food mixed in with Thai as well as pasta dishes. Just didn't seem coherent to me I guess. Overall, it was a good experience.", 
      "My wife and I are from Chicago and our friends from the area introduced us to Distihl. \u00a0It was a busy Saturday night and the service was a bit slow but given that we weren't in a rush, that was OK. \u00a0The food exceeded my expectations. \u00a0I had the Cuban sandwich and one of the better Cubans I've had in a long time! \u00a0My wife and friend both had a pasta dish which they enjoyed. \u00a0The waiter also was very knowledgeable about the menu and large number of beer choices, all of which were excellent too. \u00a0There are lots of choices in Champaign and I recommend anyone try Distihl!", 
      "My first experience was on a date. \u00a0I misheard what the waiter said when he was listing the specials. \u00a0I asked him to repeat after he was done speaking. He sighed and sort of rolled his eyes. \u00a0I ordered a turkey burger (because I'm epic classy like that). \u00a0It was cold. \u00a0It tasted like it would have been delicious had it arrived at my table 10 min sooner.My second time was just last night. \u00a0I sat at the bar with a friend to have appetizers and a few beers. \u00a0The lady at the bar was too busy literally dancing with her fellow employee (boyfriend?) and kept kissing and dancing by the kitchen to ever get my second drink.The appetizer I order was incredibly spicy, therefore it had no flavor other than pepper, and was also quite greasy. \u00a0On top of that the manager saw a buddy of his sitting next to us. \u00a0They both got into their conversation for a good 10-15min and began talking quite loudly. \u00a0I could not hear the company next to me telling a story.I may give it another shot, but its pretty unlikely.", 
      "Any draught beer from this place is a good options. Beer battered asparagus, veggie burger, Thai steak salad, or roasted beer salad you'll enjoy!", 
      "If its TL;DR: Great food, great drinks, great service.I've gone to Desthil a few times, and I'm consistently impressed by their food and attention to detail.Once, I sat at the bar with my dad, just there for drinks; bartender was great, amiable and had suggestions when we knew what we liked and wanted recommendations. Their heffeweissen is really excellent. The apricot brew actually tastes like apricot; I tend to like fruity beers, and this one stood out to me. Their cocktails are also really, really good. I had the sake lemon drop and was not disappointed. Appetizers: Hands down, no contest, their beer-battered asparagus takes the gold. Its a lighter batter, more like a very gentle tempura than a \"fried chicken\" type fry. The honey-whatever sauce they serve with it is incredible, and they serve a grilled lemon with it that you probably aren't supposed to eat but tastes like candy so do it anyways. The shrimp ceviche is nothing to write home about. The shrimp skewers entree was tasty and well seasoned, but if you came with a big appetite, it might not be the choice for you. Their portions (one of the things I like most about Desthil) are reasonable and not out of this world for most of the main dishes. My boyfriend wasn't totally full when he left, but comfortable. The thai steak salad is incredible! I like a little spice, and this definitely had that! It's not big, but its delicious. Their pizzas are also fabulous, if a little salty. You can't complain that they underseason like some places in downtown Champaign. The seabass dish (I think it was a special) was definitely worth it. They do their cubans right; their mustard is homemade I think and really rounds it out. Overall, loved it. Decently priced for what you get, and you get a great night out!", 
      "My first and hopefully last visit to Destihl was a faculty dinner (Destihl is apparently one of the few places in town large enough to accommodate simultaneous departmental functions, as there were multiple university-based parties that night). But this convenience is off-set by the depressingly overblown chain aesthetic, here manifesting as a too-self-conscious effort to seem \"on trend\" with both gastro pubs and microbreweries (witness, for instance, the giant prop barrels by the front door) while failing to capture the particular qualities of either. The \"artisan food\" was as mediocre as expected from this self-described \"gastrobrewpub TM.\" We ordered pizzas as appetizers for the table; \"stone oven\" seems to be a euphemism for \"toaster oven.\" The crusts were uniformly thin, but creepily so, without bubbling or crispness; the undersides were barely cooked. I suspect pre-formed frozen dough, by the taste and all-too-regular texture. The generous toppings were not supported by the crust, making each slice limp and increasingly wet. We also ordered the deep-fried asparagus, but I refrained -- the asparagus looked both too thick (these stalks were almost hot-dog-sized in circumference!) and too greasy.One of our dinner companions warned us against ordering burgers; on her last visit, her medium rare burger was burned black on one side (and was not at all medium rare). She guessed that the cooks went outside for a smoke and forgot to flip the burgers, but generously wondered if it had just been a long night for them in the kitchen. In an attempt to heed her advice, I tried to order the grilled and stuffed pasta without olives, but the waiter told me that the olives \"are already mixed in.\" I took that to mean that the pasta is made in a giant vat ahead of time (here I imagined a big plastic tub covered in Saran wrap in a walk-in freezer), and grilled to order, which didn't sound all that appetizing. Instead, I ordered the veggie burger (black beans and rice), and my g.f. the Kobe burger, medium rare. Both arrived with one black, charred side; her burger was well-done, ruining the meat. (Why eat Kobe beef if it's just going to be burned to a crisp?) My veggie burger was unremarkable, and my pile of shoestring fries had been overcooked in the fryer, and served to me lukewarm to cold -- totally inedible. I nibbled on two and then had to stop. Cold grease, ugh.I'd much rather order a burger and fries from Steak 'n' Shake, where you know what you're getting for the money. Overall, Destihl was a big \"no way.\" I will strenuously avoid coming here again!", 
      "The positive: \u00a0The Aztec chocolate martini comes with a brownie garnish. \u00a0And it's spicy. \u00a0The waiters and bartenders I've talked to have been incredibly friendly.The food's better than you'd expect, actually. \u00a0The salad was good, which is maybe not what you'd expect from a place that labels itself a brew pub. \u00a0The pizza's a little boring, but that's probably just the vegetarian ones I'm limited to. \u00a0They serve continuously, they have a large cocktail list, they take my American Express... it's everything a burgeoning yuppie alcoholic could want in a brew pub.Except that's not really me so here's what I don't like.The atmosphere. \u00a0As I read through the descriptions they say \"oh the atmosphere is great!\" and I say... are you at the same restaurant? \u00a0It's what a corporate design team thinks of as good atmosphere. \u00a0Large, airy, and completely devoid of personality. \u00a0It matches Jim Gould's across the street very well actually.The whole place really just reeks of chain, and I don't think that bothers most people at all but if I want to go in by myself and have a late lunch I feel very awkward. \u00a0I'm happy to go in with friends and have cocktails and split a pound of cake. \u00a0(They actually inform me that it is an 11 pound cake split 10 ways, so slightly more than a pound!)Worth checking out, if for no other reason than you too have probably been watching them work on this place for a couple years. \u00a0You can't NOT go.", 
      "Not bad, not great. I've had the pot roast sandwich and the bison burger. The pot roast was a surprisingly small portion. The bun on my bison burger was a little stale. Honestly, my biggest pet peeve with Destihl is their attempt at trying to create elevated food that just come off as tacky. For instance when I split their quesadilla appetizer they proudly touted it was deconstructed. That meant the appetizer consisted of some tortillas with melted cheese and a side of so-so grilled steak. Give me a break- I've had some cleverly deconstructed items before and that was not the case here. They do a similar thing with smores (e.g. the marshmallows come pre-melted). Tacky might be a strong word but to serve things in ways that are poorly executed and actually make eating your meal less enjoyable and more complicated in an attempt to seem high-end is pretty tacky.", 
      "I am so happy the Champaign Destil finally opened! \u00a0The food menu is a bit different from the Bloomington one, but awesome nonetheless. \u00a0Beer battered bacon is good, flatbreads are awesome, and the stout ice cream sandwiches (incredible!) have enough stout that they card people for that dessert! \u00a04oz taster glasses make trying multiple beers fun, and the bartender will even give you a FREE 2 oz taster if you don't know what you want. \u00a0Will be back over and over again!", 
      "This was the fourth time I've been to destihl since it opened in champaign. \u00a0The first two times were within the first 6 months it opened and I left less than impressed. \u00a0I finally came back a year or so later and the food has definitely gotten better.This time I went for lunch and had the swordfish tacos with rice and beans on the side. \u00a0 This was pretty good. \u00a0Maybe just a bit heavy on the sauce which masked a lot of the fish but the chimichurri sauce itself was good. \u00a0My wife had the chimichurri shrimp pizza and hers was excellent! \u00a0I also have to mention the last time I was here I had the beer-brined double bone in pork chop and that was easily the best dish I had here.After a few early lackluster visits this place is slowly becoming one of the better restaurants in the area.", 
      "Honestly, I'm a little surprised that Destihl's Yelp rating isn't higher. Two of my friends and I wandered in on a weekday night while looking for a place to eat at in downtown Champaign. The restaurant was relatively full for 7pm on Thursday, so I'd imagine there may be a wait on weekend nights. Beers = good. I think we tried 4? The strawberry blonde ale on tap was a clear favorite for us. Both their beer and dinner menus took awhile for us to look at. I was expecting traditional pub-style food, but their offerings far exceeded that.We started off with the deviled egg appetizer and the beer battered bacon appetizer. Both were very good- the beer battered bacon is a MUST. Jalapeno bacon in a tempura-like beer batter coating topped with a drizzle of maple chipotle glaze?! Yes please! When it came to our table, we slowly stopped talking and watched our plate of bacon descend in front of us. Like it came down straight from heaven. We didn't even realize we stopped talking and didn't remember what we were talking about until the bacon was gone..My friends got the jambalaya and the prosciutto-wrapped meatloaf. I really only tried part of the super tasty andouille sausage corn muffin that came with the jambalaya, as I was working on my full slab of beer-braised ribs (I gave one rib each to my friends to try though). They were perfect. Orders of magnitude better than Black Dog's ribs. I'm not sure whether or not that's a fair comparison since it's different cooking styles, but the texture of Destihl's ribs was absolutely perfect- tender, falling off the bone, but not annoyingly so.. The flavor was great also, as it tasted lovely by itself and did not need to be hidden behind sauce although the chipotle espresso bbq sauce it came with was also very tasty. My friends and I agreed that I \"won\" dinner since I ordered the best dish. My only qualm was that my shoestring fries were a little soggy and not as crispy as I would have preferred. But that's very minor.We were all pretty full, but could not pass up dessert. Like the rest of their menus, the dessert menu had a lot of tasty-sounding options. After some rock/paper/scissors, we ended up ordering the stout ice cream sandwiches which is more like four round brownie patties a la mode. But by all means, if you really wanted to, I guess you could try to eat it ice cream sandwich style. The alcohol in the chocolate stout ice cream wasn't very strong. Both the ice cream and the brownies were stellar. My friends especially loved the brownies. I was wondering what they did with the remaining brownie part after cutting out the rounds (to, you know, save waste if need be), and our waitress told us that the remainder is used for their chocolate martini? Maybe I'll check that out next time. Oh, and also, our waitress was very nice and friendly too. Overall, good service, clean place, nice decor.. everything was great. After tips, came out to ~$30/person, but actually filling up me + two guys \u00a0does require a bit of food and drink. I'm already trying to think of when I will return to try the kobe burger..", 
      "Ordered the Steak sandwich...medium. The waitress brought out a big chuck of meat sandwiched between a french roll. When I bit into my sandwich, it was bloody red! Nowhere near medium! On top of that, it was smothered with caramelized onions, which were very strong and took away from the taste of the steak! The service was average. Nothing great. Overall, I would never consider going back. I can find a better steak sandwich for a lot less at a number of different area restaurants. Coincidentally, I spoke to a friend about my experience weeks later when Destihl came up in conversation, only to find out that she had the exact situation happen to her when she visited Destihl. Her steak sandwich was extremely undercooked as well. Must be a common trend with this place. Just another common chain restaurant, as far as I'm concerned!", 
      "Living in downtown Chicago & having great restaurants right outside our door, it's hard to get really jazzed about another restaurant. Unable to find anything like Distihl with it's interesting, well executed menu & drinks. We've come to expect a great meal at our visits but this time our server, Luis, was an extraordinary compliment to the overall experience with his fun personality & great suggestions. This is a great place to eat dessert first, banana cream pie is awesome and you'll want to have room for every delicious forkful!", 
      "I really was not expecting to give a brewpub 5 stars...but here goes...We went on a Monday night, and the restaurant was FULL which was A) good to see for a new business and B) surprising! The decor is surprisingly upscale - really cool use of natural stone and wood. HUGE shame they didn't open with their patio ready to go, but when I inquired they said it was in the plans to open the patio soon.The beers (I tried 5, yup 5) were decent - not world-class, but decent. My favorite purely for summer drinkability was the Champaign Blonde, but I am admittedly not into dark beers at all, and there are PLENTY of dark ones and heavier Begian-style ales which I didn't try.The menu looked surprisingly interesting, (I was expecting burgers and pretzels), and between us we tried the pickled cucumber salad, the tuna carpaccio, the strawberry salad and the warm salmon and potato salad. All four dishes were winners, although the small plates ARE really small (which is exactly what we wanted). The entrees are MASSIVE for the price, and look like they are high quality meals, but I'm glad we saw how big they were before we ordered one!Service was excellent from beginning to end.The desserts also looks amazing, but I was too full to try. As a gay couple it was nice to feel comfortable and that there was a real mix of clientele - I was scared it was going to be exclusively Olive Garden-goers, but there were some hipsters, some queens, and some students as well as your typical 'casual-dining' crowd.Can't wait for the patio to open, but believe me, there will be a serious wait time on those tables - be prepared!", 
      "It is a place with excellent service and excellent food. The quality of the food is better than the price and the place has a classy atmosphere without the pompous attitude.", 
      "Slow service, weak food, im not sure the beers we ordered had any alcohol in them they tasted watered down. \u00a0The place looks promising but I was dissapointed.", 
      "Dishes can be hit or miss here but overall I enjoy Destihl. I recommend this for groups or other gatherings since it is casual but still pretty nice. I like the pretzels for appetizer, the burgers for entree, and the banana cream pie for dessert (it is seriously awesome).", 
      "The wait staff have been among the friendliest I have encountered in town. Last night I had a good mojito. For food, it is sometimes hit and miss. I love the salmon salad. The goat cheese and spinach salad was a little skimpy and I didn't recognize the two little dollops of goat cheese on the salad. The tortilla soup was also nothing to write home about. It is the only place in town with cheese curds! \u00a0I absolutely love the baked apple dessert! In the evenings, the sun is in just the right place to give a nice shade for the outdoor seating. All in all, I have always enjoyed my visits to Destihl.", 
      "I loved the food and beer selection. \u00a0I only wish there were more vegetarian options. \u00a0It won't keep me from going back, but I won't go as often as I might if there more veggie-friendly choices:)", 
      "The beverages are good. \u00a0The food is average. \u00a0Everything tastes a bit bland.", 
      "Despite the lack of love for Destihl on Yelp, I have to say: I am besotted.besotted/bis\u00e4tid/ - Adjective: 1. Strongly infatuated: \"he became besotted with his best friend's sister\".2. Intoxicated; drunk.Now, I am currently the first definition of besotted, with Destihl. I LOVED my visit. I went with Mr. Husband and a Very Close Friend (VCF) before seeing a movie at the Art Theater. Upon leaving, I may have been the second definition of besotted. (Just kidding, I only had one beer. I swear, my Yelp reviews make me sound like an alcoholic sometimes.)We went on a Monday evening around 6. We were seated right away. Mr. Husband and I had never been there, and we were surprised how big the restaurant actually is - it doesn't look that big from the outside. Our waiter came over right away and gave us a nice little menu introduction. I don't know why they've made a restaurant based on the things I personally like, but they did - I wanted EVERYTHING on the menu. Seriously. I haven't had such a hard time deciding on what to order for quite some time. VCF and I decided to split a small plate and an appetizer, so we got the 'House Olives' and the Bacon, Egg & Cheese deviled eggs. For my meal, I got the beer & cheddar soup and the spinach salad. VCF got the bison burger, and Mr. Husband got a special item, a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.Food: Very good, but to be honest, it *could* have been better. If Yelp let me give 4.5 stars, I would've. Everything was solid, but there were a couple things that might just push it over the top. For instance, the house olives small plate? It was agreed that it could be improved by serving the olives pre-chopped, not whole - sort of a mix between an olive salad and a tapenade. The deviled eggs were good, but the yolk was just a bit stiffer than I would've liked. The beer & cheddar soup was yum, but the scallions would have been a little better more finely sliced. The spinach salad was good, but the maple in the maple jalapeno bacon dressing was a little too sweet, and overpowered the other good stuff (grilled portabella mushroom? hell yes.) Another reason I'm torn: I love that they use ingredients from local places when possible, and have put an emphasis on sustainable farming. I'm all for buying locally and supporting small farms and businesses. On the other hand, the way it's flaunted just strikes me as a tad pretentious. Personal bias, but still.Service - Another ALMOST 5 stars. My only issue with our waiter was that he was TOO attentive. Really friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu, gave good recommendations, was able to tell us what HIS favorites are (it drives me crazy when waiters have no idea what's good on the menu.) However, he came by every 5 minutes or so. I always have mixed feelings about that. I like a server who is *there* when I need a water refill or a new fork, etc, but coming by too often just breaks up the conversation. Ambiance - Very cool. Very big-city. I like it. I also like that it's BIG. Ample room between tables. We chose a booth, and it was perfect. The noise level is ideal - quiet enough to talk at a normal level, loud enough that it doesn't feel like everyone in the area can hear what you're saying. Dessert - I can't tell you the last time I ordered dessert after dinner! That NEVER happens! (I actually can tell you, it was at my mom-in-law's birthday dinner in early October.) But VCF knows how to sweet-talk me into sweets (heh), and our waiter was VERY convincing when telling us about the stout ice cream sandwiches, which feature a housemade chocolate ice cream made with their own stout, served on chocolate brownies. Oh. Mah. Gah. SO GOOD. The stout ice cream was phenomenal. The dessert consists of two sandwiches, so you get four brownies and two scoops of ice cream. This would be great to \u00a05 out of 5 stars for the dessert!! Price - Another 5 out of 5 stars. I was expecting that I'd have one entree and a beer. We ended up with a ton of food! For $38.77 before tip (I saved my receipt!), we got: -A soda-A 12 oz. beer - the Malius Apple Blonde Ale - so good!-House Olives app-Spinach salad-Soup-Bacon cheeseburger special-1/2 of the stout ice cream sandwichesSo while I can't yet give Destihl a 'best of the best' rating, I'm definitely a fan, and certainly willing to give it another few tries. I don't want to deter anyone from going here, because my visit was truly enjoyable. I'm already planning to permanently take Jim Gould out of my date-night lineup and replace it with Destihl. I just want to acknowledge that there is some room for improvement. I think with a tiny bit of tweaking, Destihl could easily be one of the top restaurants in C-U.", 
      "A great variety of beers. very happy to have it in champaign. Food is good too but I always go here for the beer. I wish they improved their appetizers section a bit. Not many appetizers designed for sharing. awesome ambiance. Service depends on how busy they are the wait staff you get. I have been here many times and the experience varied.", 
      "A nice addition to Downtown Champaign.", 
      "You won't go wrong with anything on the menu. All of the food here is incredible. Things you can't miss: Beer Battered Asparagus, \u00a0Flat Iron Steak Quesadilla with Blue Cheese, Mediterranean Pizza and Stuffed Poblano Pepper. Leave room for the S'mores!", 
      "The service here has been great! No complaints.The beers are hit-or-miss -- I've tasted a couple that were PHENOMENAL and ended up in a growler purchase but some are subpar. Taste tests are in order!The food is good, but nothing extraordinary -- on the thai salad, it would've been nice to have more than 4 slivers of steak but it tasted wonderful. \u00a0The pizzas are also tasty. Clean, inoffensive, and not terribly expensive.", 
      "After waiting years for this to finally open (and moving 2 years ago) I finally tried it out on my way back to St. Louis from the Chicago area. \u00a0It was after 2 pm, so no idea how things are during peak times. \u00a0I liked the atmosphere, although the AC was at arctic levels. \u00a0I enjoyed my food and drink, but since I was traveling, I just got a sampler of the Altercation (a good compromise between light and dark), and the spinach salad (enjoyed the maple bacon dressing) and the Cuban Pork. \u00a0Recommended stop in downtown Champaign - in the large condo tower on Neil in downtown. \u00a0There's a gigantic parking deck behind it, or metered parking in the city lot across the street, where there are 2 Zipcars stationed. \u00a0Good move, Champaign."

      "Went here for dinner with a few colleagues. There was spacious seating, so it was a \u00a0great place for groups. Had the Dijon chicken with asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes. I was kind of put off by the dark color of the sauce, but the whole entree was pretty good; chicken was flavorful and tender too. For dessert I had the baked apples, which was good but nothing unique. Our waitress was very attentive, but \u00a0her attentiveness seemed to taper off as the night went on.", 
      "Deep fried bacon is awesome. Great selection of beers. Service good. Waiter waaay too social. Buffalo was yummy. Nice ambiance. Ample parking. Reasonable prices.", 
      "We were here over the weekend and its a really nice spot, we didn't really order food, except for some garlic bread which was cool. We went there for their beer since afterall, they are a brewery. $1.25 for 4oz beers....you can try close to everything they brew and then some. I had 6 and my bf had 5, our bill was just under $20. They had pumpkin ale, hefeweizen, chocolate cherry, coffee beer, IPA's...too many to remember, you'll have to check it out yourself. Can't wait to go back and maybe try some things on their menu. Fun bartender too, ask for Mike!", 
      "Had lunch here 2/8/13. Server was Melanie. She was cute polite knowledgeable and competent. Had something akin to a club sandwich and potato bacon soup. It was good. Overall nothing to call anyone out on ;)", 
      "Couldn't be better for lunch. Service was on point and friendly (word on the street is they hijacked 80% of Houlihan's staff). Their beers were solid, too. I couldn't get the Yelp App to check me in so I could upload my pic of the tastiest stout I've ever had, so you are just going to have to trust me on its delicousity. I tried a taster (4oz for $1.50) of their berry weiss beer and it was a little too much berry for me, but if you like that kind of thing, you will love Destihl's take on it: the flavors of sweet and tart bounce back and forth dynamically as you sip. A companion loved their IPA, lauding the freshness and the spicyness of the hops.The food is as good as anywhere else downtown. My table ordered the portabello sandwich which was really hearty and came with kettle chips with a touch of seasoning and Destihl's Kobe burger, which is served on a fancy bun I did non recognize and stacked with thick jalepeno bacon, bleu and white chedar cheeses, pickles, and comes with the best steak fries I've ever tasted. That burger is about the same price as Farren's and the verdict was it was just as good, if not better, owing to the extra special toppings. Destihl's fries are thick badasses with the skin on and huge flecks of kosher or sea salt and were both perfectly crispy and cooked the whole way thru. Those are served with their balsamic vinegar (and expresso bean?) barbecue sauce that is unlike any I've ever had. As good as the kettle chips are, I highly recommend you sub in for the steak fries (though I saw some gorgeous piles of sexy shoestring fries served with other dishes, giving me one more reason for a quick return).Another reason for a quick return is the very impressive menu. Vegetarian will have no problem here, nor will the health-concious. They have a wide and deep menu spanning from American classic pub fare to trendy fusion dishes usually found only in more expensive restaurants. Prices were not exceedingly low, however value is good. I did not see their spirits or wine menus, but the lineup behind the bar bodes well for those not in the mood for beer.This place takes the best of Boltini's, Seven Saints, the Pigs, Radio, and Bacaro and serves it up in a killer setting with great \u00a0modern ambiance. I will never pass up an invite to eat here.", 
      "The waitress and hostess were super friendly. \u00a0Waitress recommended lots of options (her favorite salad, pizza, app, sandwich, etc) and beers. I went with a strawberry ale, cheese curds and the greekish salad. \u00a0The beer was excellent - fruity and light! \u00a0The cheese curds were great but the more you ate, the more blah you felt...share with someone! \u00a0The greekish salad was weird...it had a red dressing that I didn't like at all. \u00a0Bill came to $19. \u00a0A little pricey for lunch but not outrageous.", 
      "I wanted to come back and let ya'll know that Destihl has recently become vegan-friendly! \u00a0The marinated cucumbers and beer-battered asparagus are both vegan as-is, and Destihl has added an 8 oz veggie burger to their menu that can be made vegan if the mayo's left off. \u00a0I believe there are a few other items that are vegan (the peanuts and the chips are, sans ranch dip), but I haven't confirmed them with the chef, so I'll leave you to figure that out on your own!",

      "This is a fun place with a trendy atmosphere. It's one of the few places in town that allow you to mix and match beer flights at a fair price. The food is fun and tasty. I recommend the mussels, pizzas, and wings.", 
      "Loved the Beer Battered Deep Friend Bacon... yes BACON! Staff was wonderful and helpful even when I had a small problem with my sandwich. I hadn't read that the fried egg on the BLT was made sunny side up so when I got it I ran everywhere. I don't like sunny side up eggs so they took it back without question and got me a different burger. Which was wonderful! Would have loved to had some dessert but I was too full when I got done. Great place!", 
      "I went here for lunch with a large group. \u00a0I thought the menu selections were unique and gourmet. \u00a0We ordered the Fried Asparagus and they were lightly battered and fried to perfection. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0My friend is Gluten Free and they have a menu just for GF items....she had some type of pizza that looked and tasted delicious. \u00a0We didn't have any alcohol it was a work lunch, so I can't speak to that.", 
      "Well, I searched the website to see where I wanted to have my birthday dinner with my coworkers. \u00a0I was seeking out a restaurant that had a little bit of this and a little bit of that so that everyone can find something that they would enjoy eating. \u00a0Everyone enjoyed their dishes and we kept on watching the staff bring out different dishes as we would comment how yummy it looks.I was torn between two dishes and I asked the staff their recommendation. \u00a0She did not steer me wrong. \u00a0It was so tasty that I wanted to eat another entree of it. \u00a0Every dish they brought to the table look so tempting. \u00a0Definitely a wide variety and everyone enjoyed a nice beer and atmosphere. \u00a0Glad we made reservations because the place filled up quick for a Friday night. \u00a0Service was awesome and I am already missing it. \u00a0I will definitely be back before I leave town.", 
      "I've been in for both lunch and dinner multiple times since they opened. I've heard about their Bloomington-Normal location. The food is quite delicious and very flavorful, however I must say they go overboard with heat at times! (But that us a matter of taste of course !) very clean facilities, comfortable space and very nice selection of beer. I must say that the hard alcohol drinks are not always consistent in flavor or liquid amount.", 
      "My daughter had heard good things about Destihls, so we decided to give it a try. \u00a0We went on a Saturday night (12/1/12), so the place was pretty busy. \u00a0Fortunately, I was able to get a reservation through OpenTable via Yelp, so getting in was no problem.When we arrived, we were seated within 30 seconds. \u00a0I appreciate that efficiency - we also saw several groups that tried the walk-in route - Lesson Learned - use the Yelp reservation system for fast seating!We ordered the home-made chips for an appetizer, and they were great. \u00a0Very tasty, and a malt vinegar sauce, as well as a spicy sauce.This place makes and serves it's own beer. \u00a0if you want a Bud Light, you'll have to go elsewhere. \u00a0If you want to try their beer, the prices are quite honestly, very low for good beer. \u00a0We tried their 4 ounce beers (I know, so small, but since you're trying a store brew, do I really want 16 ounces I don't like after one sip?) and for $1 and $1.50 (the price range of a 4 ounce beer), we got 2 beers that were very palatable and very good.On to dinner. The menu ranges from sandwiches to steaks to pizza.I ordered the 8 ounce Sirloin, medium rare. \u00a0The steak was cooked properly, more importantly, it was seasoned properly, and tasted great. \u00a0It was more tender than some fillets I have had recently. \u00a0A+!My wife ordered a pork roast dish, that had pork so tender you didn't need a knife. \u00a0She really liked the dish.My daughter went with the 8 ounce burger, and was very impressed. \u00a0She ordered it medium rare, and it was cooked to order. \u00a0She loved it.My son ordered one of the pizzas, and was a little surprised when a large, thin crust pizza arrived (pleasantly surprised - he was expecting a lot less.) \u00a0The pizza was great.We ordered desert, which included carrot cake (we ordered 1 piece for 2 people, and it was the right choice - very heavy, very good), along with S'mores and a Neopolitan fruit dish, all of which were very good.The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is the noise level - the interior is nicely appointed, and very well done, but the acoustics are not very good. \u00a0Lots of hard surfaces result in a loud restaurant, where it was hard to hear our server.We'll be back. \u00a0The entire ticket with tip was less than $110 for four adults.", 
      "4.5/5 -- Great restaurant all around. Friendly, helpful waitstaff. Diverse and large menu of appetizers, meat, veggies, seafood, drinks, desserts, everything. I tried the shrimp ceviche (awesome summer dish), swordfish (delicious, yet small for a swordfish steak), fish and chips (delicious as well), and a cherry heffeweizen and a Hawaiian fruit beer to drink. Everything was awesome, tasty, and presented well. Can't wait to go back!", 
      "We have been to Destihl several times. I've heard beer enthusiasts say that their brewery and beers aren't that great, but the food more than makes up for it. Everything I've ordered has been great, and the service is spot-on. I've gone with just my husband, larger groups of adults, and have also gone with the kids. It's been smooth sailing no matter the size or composition of the group. Their kids menu is broader than most, which is nice. The regular menu offers unique dishes that have always enjoyed. I would definitely recommend it.", 
      "We enjoyed this place very much for lunch. \u00a0We started with the beer battered asparagus - yum! \u00a0We were happy to see that they offer 4 ounce glasses of beer and sampled several good beers. The menu is varied and inspired. \u00a0Everything we tried can hold its own with any big city restaurant we've tried. \u00a0The restaurant is sleek and beautiful and the service was great.", 
      "Good food. First time for us. \u00a0We will be back!", 
      "I've been to Destihl twice now--both times I was pretty disappointed. The first visit we ordered the stone baked pretzels for an appetizer, which was a cool novelty. But for my entree I ordered just a simple bacon cheeseburger (cooked medium), which seems hard to mess up, but it tasted entirely like carbon. The whole outside of the patty seemed to taste of charred chemicals.The second visit was a group outing. I ordered a strawberry goat cheese salad, and it arrived with ONE SLIVER OF A STRAWBERRY on it. It was just greens, a bit of cheese, and one solitary nub of strawberry. Weird.Also the group ordered the pound of chocolate cake, which we were told just came in off the truck, and it was still frozen, so that was a no go. Luckily our nice waitress maybe told the kitchen to take a blow torch to it, because she got it to us before we left.", 
      "We have had Destihl in Bloomington-Normal for some time but I've been looking forward to the addition to the Champaign-Urbana restaurant options for some time. \u00a0And I'm glad it has arrived!! \u00a0I found the atmosphere cozier than the B/N Destihl. \u00a0The service was FAST! \u00a0My iced tea was never empty (which is impressive because I drink fast and a LOT....which is why I opt for the iced tea and not the beer).The food did not disappoint. \u00a0I'm a fan of the beer battered asparagus appetizer. \u00a0And opted for the Brewmaster Pizza on this trip. \u00a0Everyone in my party of 6 had something different and came away pleased with their meals. \u00a0I used OpenTable to make a reservation which was quick and convenient. \u00a0We were in and out in about an hour....much quicker than I expected. \u00a0In my opinion, a great addition to the Downtown area! \u00a0Perfect for dinner before hopping over to The Art Theater! \u00a0 Welcome Destihl!!!", 
      "Food was excellent and service was wonderful, would recommend a visit and decide for yourself. Have super day.", 
      "Visiting friends in Champaign and came here for lunch. \u00a0Contemporary, open restaurant with a good vibe in downtown Champaign. \u00a0Our waiter was Trent; very personable, knowledgeable and helpful. \u00a0There is no set beer flight but you can order 4 oz small glasses if you want to sample. \u00a0I really enjoyed the Oktoberfest and the Roadblock British Red Ale. \u00a0We shared the Beer Batter Asparagus for an appetizer and really enjoyed it (Trent encouraged us to squeeze the grilled lemon over the Asparagus and glad that we did). \u00a0We ordered the Lunch Combos. \u00a0The soup and sandwiches were top notch. \u00a0 I know there are a lot of restaurants in the C/U area, but you can't go wrong here. \u00a0If the rest of the wait staff are as good as Trent, you will be taken care of quite nicely. \u00a0 Very good beer, very good food in an inviting atmosphere, I definitely recommend Destihl.", 
      "The rueben is awesome. \u00a0The bison burger leaves much to be desired. \u00a0It has a very French flavor to it, which just doesn't seem right for bison at all.The bourbons they have should be better than what they are carrying.", 
      "I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant/brew pub. \u00a0The beer selection is pretty good here if you want to try different beers, and their food is pretty good. \u00a0I came here for brunch which was average, but I really enjoyed the pizza I ordered on a different occasion. \u00a0I would recommend this place as a nice spot to go for dinner.", 
      "Stopped in for a quick appetizer and beer after work and it was Wonderful. \u00a0Beer was fresh and tasty. Ordered the ceveche and it was AWESOME!!! \u00a0Great prices. Great atmosphere! \u00a0Loved it!", 
      "Excellent food at very reasonable prices, beer was very tasty, environment was pleasant and even upscale, and I would recommend this place to anyone. \u00a0My family thoroughly enjoyed the experience. \u00a0Back to the beer, I did a sampler and found the various beers to be very much above average. \u00a0I tried their hallmark sour beer with trepidation, but enjoyed it. \u00a0It's like a cider with a sour twist--done right.", 
      "Expensive but the taste does not worth the price.", 
      "I love the decor of this restaurant. \u00a0I am also a huge fan of the fried cheese curds and fried asparagus. I recommend that you try it . \u00a0The portion sizes are very generous and the assortment of ale is unique.", 
      "This restaurant is above average in selection but average in delivery. We ordered a couple of entr\u00e9e salads which were small but quite good. One person ordered sweet potato fries which were so overcooked we asked for a replacement which was not much better. The iced tea was unique and worth it. I suspect the draw here is the beer which none of us ordered.", 
      "Every time I go to Destihl, I want to love it but I always leave disappointed. The menu is very creative in concept but the execution is always sub par. I've tried the seared scallops over curried mashed potatoes and the thai half chicken. The scallops were hardly seared and the potatoes were waaaaay over salted. The chicken on the other hand was far under spiced and seasoned. I will say their beer battered jalepeno bacon is delicious but deep fried food is pretty hard to screw up. Overall the prospect of having a modern american restaurant with an eclectic menu in the CU area is a great one, but a bit more attention to detail would greatly help Destihl.", 
      "Tried this place around 5:30 on a weeknight and it was not at all busy. It did start getting busier towards the end of the meal, but our service was good. Luckily for me I had not been highly anticipating the opening of Destihl. The beers were good enough. There were about a dozen to choose from so if you drink beer at all, you should be able to find one you like. The night we went in we were given free 2oz samples of as many of the beers \u00a0as we wanted to try. I tried the Belgian, Strawberry Blonde and Raspberry Wheat, Champaign Blond and Frankengluten - good flavors, but none will be appearing on my all-time favorites list. The Frankengluten was interesting and worth a try if you are adventurous. Our waiter was nice and attentive enough but could not properly give drink recommendations since he was not old enough to drink. I thought this strange since, clearly, patrons are going to want to know about the beer. The food... I had the brie and portabello sandwich with chips. The chips were average and the sandwich was bland. That's honestly about the best I can say. My dinner partner said his steak salad was excellent and it looked fresh and crisp, but I can't vouch for the taste. We split the beer battered asparagus and that was by far my favorite item. I will probably go back at some point for another try. The pizza and a desserts sounded like they may have potential.Second visit 8/27/11: Finally tried the pizza (pesto and goat cheese) and still really no change in my review. Nice wait staff but the food does not overly impress. You do receive a large quantity of food for the price. Although, for me, quantity does not trump quality.", 
      "Had dinner with a group of friends and felt the food was very over rated. \u00a0Bison burger was salty and the service was took forever. \u00a0Had to ask for condiments after the food arrived and drinks took forever. \u00a0Disappointing experience.", 
      "If there were an option for negative stars, DESTIHL Champaign would have a rating of -5 stars. \u00a0What a complete failure this restaurant is. \u00a0This place reminds me too much of the Jim Gould success failure story. \u00a0It's a tale of how a restaurant owner and chef become to sure of themselves and stop trying only to discover complete failure. \u00a0I pride myself in knowing good food and good restaurants. \u00a0I have studied cullinary technique and have a passion for fresh, quality ingredients that produces a meal that leaves you longing for more. \u00a0I write this review, having visited DESTIHL three times spread out over the course of a year. \u00a0I sent my food back two out of the three times. \u00a0The second time, I ordered the veggie burger which was hands down the WORST veggie burger I've ever sampled. \u00a0I did not send this back because it was not the way the burger was cooked, it was a pure and simple failure on the design. \u00a0My first experience I ordered swordfish. \u00a0It was overcooked, returned and cooked perfectly. \u00a0My husband ordered the Bison burger, medium rare and it came out well done. \u00a0While waiting for the food to return, the manager apologized and brought us free appetizers. \u00a0The meal ticket was reduced due to the error in the kitchen. \u00a0I was optimistic about this restaurant and the situation was handled perfectly.Last night, I returned for what I was hoping to be a perfect swordfish. \u00a0My husband's and I's order was the same. \u00a0Bison burger and swordfish. \u00a0First try at our order lended the same results. \u00a0Both dishes overcooked and returned. \u00a0Second try at our order, my husbands burger was cooked perfectly, my swordfish was raw. \u00a0Third try at the swordfish, still raw! \u00a0I changed my order to salmon at the waiter's recommendation. \u00a0Finally a manager appears and delivers the Salmon stating \"this is cooked to the chef's perfection.\" \u00a0The manager slither's off like a snake before I even touch the salmon. \u00a0Without cutting into the salmon, It was obvious that this fish was too raw. \u00a0My family had finished eating and after an hour and a half wait with no food, no appetizers, and a chef that I was now convinced can not cook at all, I ordered a Greek Salad. \u00a0This salad looked like someone threw the ingredients on my plate. \u00a0No order, presentation was horrible. \u00a0The dressing was red oil. \u00a0This dressing did not taste like greek dressing at all. \u00a0I ate the salad in disbelief that this place can not even prepare a good salad. \u00a0Our ticket was once again adjusted but this experience left a sour taste in my mouth. \u00a0I e-mailed the general manager and COO for the company and am awaiting a reply. \u00a0I would recommend no one go to this restaurant. \u00a0Seated across the street is Ko Fusion, an amazing restaurant. \u00a0This restaurant is too close for comfort for DESTIHL as this is where I will be seated watching DESTIHL's doors close for good if they do not find a chef that can cook the menu that was created.EDIT: \u00a0Less than 12 hours after my e-mail, I received a phone call from the general manager. \u00a0He was very kind and appologized. \u00a0More than this he listened. \u00a0He was kind and acknowledged that my concerns were valid. \u00a0He stated over and over again that there are no good excuses. \u00a0Humiliy allows for growth and I hope that this general managers humility induces change that produces solid growth.In March 2013, My husband and I used compensation cards to return. \u00a0The following is my email to the manager of destihl.I e-mailed back in October regarding a disappointing dinner and service that my family I experienced at Destihl Champaign. \u00a0We received compensation cards and returned tonight in order to assess if the service and food improved. \u00a0Our server was once again phenomenal, but the food was less than stellar. \u00a0My husband and I both ordered the swordfish, which were once again not cooked properly. \u00a0The swordfish were dry and over cooked, even upon reorder. \u00a0I guessed by the drying of the fish that a meat thermometer was used to assess if they were cooked properly, which in my opinion is an amateur error. \u00a0I then ordered a small portion Greek salad due to my hunger, my husband did not order one and we were charged for both. \u00a0I then ordered a gluten free Mediterranean pizza and my husband, a bone in ribeye. \u00a0My pizza could not possibly have been gluten free because within seconds, I felt sick and bloated and my husband's ribeye was cooked unevenly and dried out! \u00a0Most likely another piece of meat fallen victim to the meat thermometer. \u00a0With a history in restaurant service and cooking, I was appalled that we were charged for the salads and the pizza and were virtually comped nothing for the less than stellar food that we received. \u00a0Please do not send us any more compensation cards as we will not be returning, but I wanted to let you know that we are completely dissatisfied with ALL of our experiences at Destihl Champaign.", 
      "My steak tasted weird, but the soda bread they give you is really good", 
      "We were greeted and seated near our reservation time even though the restaurant was very busy. Our server was quickly at our table and very attentive at first. \u00a0We ordered our drinks and food and all was well. \u00a0However, an hour later our server explained that there were a number of large parties who were getting their food before us so it was taking this long. \u00a0He delivered our food and never came back to the table. My order was correct and fairly tasty but my wife's order was wrong and there was never anyone to ask about correcting it. \u00a0Very long wait for the wrong food and very disappointed in our experience. \u00a0There are quite a few restaurants downtown, this will not be on our short list for another visit.", 
      "The bacon is great and the asparagus is amazing. \u00a0This is all I can say good for this place. \u00a0The wait staff always seems very busy standing in the corner chatting instead of checking on patrons. \u00a0I've given this place too many chances to be disappointed every time. \u00a0I even wrote a letter to the manager once to get an insencere apology. \u00a0Clearly nothing has changed as I am writing this sitting at the bar after being ignored for 20 minutes and counting with an empty glass on a very slow Monday night.", 
      "I have been here 3 times for dinner and both times I enjoyed the food. It's also a very good place to bring children, and they have healthier children's meals with pb & j and fruit, unlike many other places that just add junk into children's meals. Each time I've been here, I've had a generally positive experience. The wait staff are very friendly and helpful. I would definitely continue to go here."

      "Finished a wonderful day with Dublin O'Neil's Bread and Butter Pudding. Amazing! I've never had bread pudding this good. Irish bar, not driving, had to have an Irish coffee. Asked about one and they offered to create one with Jameson... it was brought to the table warm. I asked them to heat... waiter said he would bring me another. This one was much more temperature coffee should be...Love the look of the bar, brick wall, small tables for hearing conversations, moderate volume on music... but every time door opened a blast of cold air hit you. Next time need a table toward the back.", 
      "I'm not sure what anything there tastes like except the pub burger ... and I dont think I ever will because its THAT GOOD why would you want to try anything else? I love the atmosphere ... very old school pub like ... good beer, festive patrons, and the best burger you will ever bite into! !!", 
      "This place used to be amazing. Now... It's okay.When we first started coming here, we loved the fact that they had good, reasonably priced food and a good selection of beer that was also reasonably priced. The fish and chips were really great and could easily feed two people. The boxty pancakes were high quality and decently sized. In general, everything was very good.In the past few months, however, there have been some changes. Serving sizes are smaller. Prices are higher all around. And the quality of the food just isn't up to par with what it once was. It's pretty disappointing.A year ago, I would have and did recommend this spot to pretty much everyone. Now? It's just another overpriced downtown bar.", 
      "We were told it would be twenty minute wait. It was an hour. Food is fine but they need to be more up front on the wait time. It got better, there was food stuck to the menu and one of our party was served tea in a glass with a crack.", 
      "I love this place. \u00a0Before I had complaints about the food being a little bland, but I have noticed a big change this past year. Salt! I almost always get the Irish nachos, and the whiskey sour is to die for. They use egg whites in it, so it's nice a smooth. We love this place!", 
      "We have been do Dublin O'Neil's several times now and its becoming one of our favorite places. \u00a0We love the irish nachos, bangers and mash and chicken pot pie! \u00a0The service is always good and we love to put a penny in the wall each time we are there.", 
      "First time here on a Sunday night, love irish fare so looking forward to it. \u00a0Shepard pie is lamb as it should be and wife rated as 'OK' \u00a0/ \u00a0I had a favorite 'Bangers & Mash' and would eat them again. \u00a0Beer selection was good as was the service. \u00a0 We will be back.", 
      "Dublin O'Neil's is one of those places with outstanding ambience and excellent food. The Irish Nachos are incredible. The seafood chowder may be the best chowder I've had anywhere. The macaroni and cheese is absolutely excellent with solid overtones of smoked Gouda. The only thing that made me grade them down is a lack of a kids menu. (Not difficult to add if they'd just do it.)The draught beer selection is also excellent. I'm a huge fan!", 
      "They just redid their menu which is good because I was quickly bored with the options here. Their food is a lot more reasonably priced than similar restaurants in the area and the quality is pretty good but sometimes their menu can seem limited. Certain dishes are better than others and even ones that sound interesting can turn out to be rather bland. They also frequently repeat specials so there's rarely something that I haven't tried.The bloody mary's we had yesterday were pretty great! and well seasoned. Could be more creative with the garnish though.On another note, the service can be hit or miss. Yesterday we experienced wonderful service but just last January four of us had to seat ourselves after standing in the front of the restaurant and being ignored for 20 minutes and then sitting down and being ignored for another 20 minutes until we even got to see menus.", 
      "Two stars might be generous for me, but I'm trying to be nice. Despite the fact that there was only one other table seated, service was painfully slow and apparently, if you're a party of two, you can only have a tall table along the wall. The decor/style is okay for a \"pub,\" but that's where the pub atmosphere ends. It's just another pretentious eatery downtown in a varied genre. No music. Limited drink availability to what they perceive as \"authentic,\" and the first two I tried to order they didn't have the ingredients for. A disappointing start, for sure. The menu is largely English traditional (bangers, Americanized shepherd's pie, etc)We started with the \"Irish\" nachos because it made me giggle and I like corned beef. Most of the \"meat\" was just wads of fat and they were so greasy that it dripped off the chips as you picked them up. The couple of dry chips we found weren't too bad.I got the fish and chips which, literally, developed a pool of grease in the bottom of the basket. You have to request salt/pepper/ketchup since the tables the so tiny, I guess. I finished one of three small fillets before I just couldn't do it. My companion enjoyed the flavor of the shank, but it was a little cool in temperature.The entrees are fairly pricey ($13-$20+) from what I recall, and completely not worth it. I won't go back.", 
      "There's only one thing that really needs to be said: Smoked Gouda Mac & Cheese. Be still my heart. I am so happy they made it an option for an entree. I ordered it with rashers; my sister with bangers. Both were very, very tasty. Everyone at the table enjoyed their food. Service wasn't slow. And dessert has never disappointed.", 
      "My first and last visit. Beer selection marginal. Shepard's pie was obviously frozen and microwaved. Center was cold and greasy", 
      "We had late lunch on a Saturday and the place was fairly empty. \u00a0Nice small place with a few tables outside. \u00a0Food was tasty, our server was awesome, funny and friendly. \u00a0I had veg pot pie, which was good, tasted very homemade. \u00a0My husband had a meatball sandwich and a scotch egg. \u00a0Not the best scotch egg he's ever had (Broad Ripple Brew Pub, Indiana) but the sandwich was ok. \u00a0Fun place, but kind of pricey for a casual lunch.", 
      "What happened to the website???The one time we ate there last year we loved the food. We had a few drinks there for St Pat's & when I looked for the website to scope out what another patron was eating...BOINNNG. No website. I should have just asked.", 
      "I was torn between 2 and 3 stars. \u00a0 I tried this place for the first time last weekend due to some friends who wanted to drink here. \u00a0There is really two stories when it comes to my experience.The food- \u00a0This is where I would give this place 2 or maybe even 1 star. \u00a0I love shepherds pie and it was of course on the menu, so I ordered it. \u00a0It was a somewhat decent portion and looked good. \u00a0However, the goodness ended there. \u00a0When I laid my fork into it I discovered that this was not a shepherds pie. \u00a0What I was served was a liquid soup like substance. \u00a0I couldn't even eat it with a fork so I had to request a spoon, which was an adventure. \u00a0I had to wait 10 minutes before I could get someones attention to bring me a spoon. The drinks- They have a decent beer selection, but I wouldn't go back for that. \u00a0What I would go back is for their mixed drinks. \u00a0They have a nice drink selection and do a great job making them. \u00a0They take their time and make them right with some semi-advanced techniques. \u00a0Although the bartenders sucked as waiters/waitresses (see spoon story above), they were great bartenders. \u00a0I would easily give this place 4 or 5 stars when it comes to drinks.Will I come back? \u00a0Maybe, but I will not order food here again. \u00a0It is a shame since this is the only Irish Pub in Champaign/Urbana. \u00a0No, Murphy's does not count as an Irish Pub or anything. \u00a0Using a green shamrock and an Irish name doesn't make a bar an Irish Pub.", 
      "Went there for the first time last night. Took 10 minutes to get my beer, but the wife got her soda right away. Waiter brought the wrong appetizer. \u00a0Advised him of this after about 5 minutes (because he never came back). He realized he gave us another table's appetizer. \u00a0He took the appetizer off our table and gave it to the right table (I could not believe he did that). \u00a0Then our food came out before our appetizer. \u00a0It was very loud and service was not good. \u00a0Food was average. \u00a0Not a big menu, a little pricy, and small space. \u00a0Was the first and last time we go there. \u00a0Nothing special.", 
      "Perfect little place to sit and enjoy a drink/meal. \u00a0Great environment and service is good too.", 
      "We came here for NYE '13 dinner. About halfway through our dinner, a country/folk? band started performing extremely depressing songs. not my idea of new years cheer. The food was awesome! I loved every bite of it! Our waitress asked us to order the specials since they were competing to sell the most. I thought that was unprofessional and uncomfortable. All four of us ended up getting a special, but not because she had requested it.The ribs were to die for. the meat was tender and the truffles/ mushrooms were cooked well. I don't know if this special will be offered again, but if it is, i highly recommend it.Minus a star because they won't make an irish coffee. My bf ordered one and they would only serve him one of their fancy drinks. how hard is it to put whisky into coffee at a restaurant with a bar?", 
      "My wife and I tried this place for the first time tonight.I want to start by saying our waitress was excellent! She provided great service and was very attentive. The kitchen on the other hand, was really, really slow.We ordered beer battered bangers for an appetizer. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the serving was generous.For our entrees my wife ordered salmon that came with Gouda macaroni and asparagus. I ordered fish and chips. We waited almost an hour for our entrees to be served.When our food arrived it was quite tasty (or maybe I was just starving by then) and the portions were plentiful. The Gouda macaroni and cheese was very good.Besides the food preparation being really slow it was way too loud! The place isn't that big. When it's packed with people all trying to talk at the same time it's loud. Even with the sound level uncomfortably high, management still feels its necessary to crank the sound system up to a level making it impossible to hold a conversation.The food is good, but the environment makes it impossible to enjoy your meal!", 
      "I don't know anything about how authentically Irish the food, decor, or general ambiance is. \u00a0What I do know is that ALL of the meat in this restaurant is sourced locally, and is pastured - in the case of the beef, it's 100% grass-fed. \u00a0As someone who will ONLY eat local pastured meats, and therefore is limited to vegetarian or pescetarian choices in restaurants, this is an AMAZING gift! \u00a0To be in a restaurant that goes out of its way to use these kinds of meats is phenomenal. \u00a0To all those who complain about the prices - I guarantee you they are VERY reasonable for this kind of meat! \u00a0...and worth every penny, as far as I'm concerned. \u00a0They also use these great paper to-go boxes instead of styrofoam. \u00a0I'm thrilled to support any business that goes that much out of its way to support the environment and other local businesses and small agriculture.As far as the good goes, what we had was awesome. \u00a0A couple of Irish coffees (one traditional, one Baileys) to get us warm after coming in from the cold weather, an appetizer of Irish nachos, and entrees were fish-n-chips and shepherd's pie... after the food was so fabulous, we had to try the desserts, even though it meant taking a lot of it home in the aforementioned boxes. \u00a0The flourless chocolate cake was good, and the bread pudding was amazing.We went mid-afternoon, so I can't speak to the crowds, since there weren't any. \u00a0The waitress was awesome. \u00a0The food was slow, as someone else mentioned, but we were warned ahead of time that it was all made fresh-to-order, so we were already prepared for that.All-in-all, I highly recommend it, and we'll definitely be going back!", 
      "I went for lunch yesterday. I was impressed! We had a very nice waiter. I got the spinach salad and I ate every single bite. The ingredients were fresh and it wasn't over-dressed. My friend got the Pub burger. It looked amazing. He raved about it. Not sure if they take reservations. If you go in the evening, it'd be helpful to call ahead. My friends tried to go for dinner recently and they said it was shoulder to shoulder packed. Looking forward to going again and trying more dishes.", 
      "Poor service and bad food. Never a good combination.We ordered 2 beers, and the waitress did not know anything about them. Would have been nice to get a warning they were hoppier than that type of beer usually is.BF ordered the seafood chowder which turned out to be the best item. He also got the seafood stew which was WAY oversalted, like, no one tasted it going out. Stew portion was tiny compared to other stews I've had elsewhere in the country (like 2 mussels, 2 clams, 2 shrimp). Also, the broth was thickened tomato based, which is fine I guess, but I prefer thin tomato based broth.I had the bangers and mash. The potatoes were supposed to be kale mashed, but I only found one, small piece of kale. They potatoes were cold to lukewarm at best. Clearly sitting in a pot while the sausages were cooked. They were hot, at least, but a little mushy. Gravy was ok.We told our server our issues and she said, oh. Sorry.Oh, sorry, we won't be back.", 
      "Sooooooo.... we came in around 130 am... William and Megan were so hospitable. \u00a0 They were so welcoming and even allowed us to buy a couple rounds when, if I were a bartender, \u00a0 I would be hard pressed not to try to get people to leave. \u00a0 The level of professionalism displayed by these two was impeccable. \u00a0 I even learned that Megan was coming in at 10am... Are you kidding me close to open \u00a0and so hospitable? \u00a0You have a star. \u00a0Honestly, \u00a0I didn't even look around to see the decor because I was so amazed by the service. \u00a0Six years absent from chambana and this was an experience to make me regret graduating.", 
      "Seems weird to give 5 stars to a new place in a slightly cardboard building, \u00a0BUT the category is 'as good as it gets' and I always rate that according to the city in which I am....Firstly - to those who criticize it for not being 'irish' enough - get over yourselves. We're not in Dublin unfortunately, which means Champaign doesn't have access to the resources and ingredients that Dublin restaurants do.Ambience: Fun, noisy enough to get away with the occasional swear word.Service: Friendly, unobtrusive, quick.Drinks: AwesomeFood: Surprisingly good - more gastro-pub than PUB fare...excellent options for carnivores, pescatarians and veges alike.Highly recommend.", 
      "Great cozy place for a well prepared meal. \u00a0My favorite dishes are the potato pancakes, Irish nachos, fisherman stew, and best of all, \u00a0the short ribs. Nice beer selection as well.", 
      "I went back last night for some late night food and drinks after a movie, and need to update this a bit. \u00a0The food and drinks are great. \u00a0Seafood Chowder and potato pancakes with smoked salmon are amazing. \u00a0I am addicted to their steamed mussels. \u00a0The food is still excellent. \u00a0Enjoyed some Two Brothers on tap, Baily's and Coffee for my buddy, and they had an Irish like folk band playing that was really good.The service was horrific. \u00a0There might have been two other full tables besides us, along with just two or three people at the bar. \u00a0The place was not packed at all. \u00a0It was damn near impossible to get served. \u00a0The waitress would not even look at us most the night. \u00a0I don't know what happened? \u00a0During a nearly full lunch hour, the service was spot on before. \u00a0We could not even get our bill after asking several times. \u00a0Really, you guys don't want to get money for the meal and drinks? \u00a0OK, fine with me. \u00a0We ended up just putting some cash on the table and left. \u00a0I am thinking of taking off another star. \u00a0Though the food, vibe, and drinks was still excellent.", 
      "Been to Dublin two times, and here are a few things I noticed:The potato pancake appetizer was delicious.The chicken pot pie was missing ... chicken.Burger was super over-seasoned and poorly cooked.Curried Vegetable Stew was really, really good.Fries were quite nice.Bartender very friendly.A-OK!", 
      "Second time here. I like this place! The decor is simple, clean, sophisticated yet pubby feeling. Each time the service was very good. The bartenders are very knowledge on the different beers, of which there are many, and helpful. The menu has a lot of very good looking choices. We had the mussels, smoked gouda mac and cheese, shepherds pie, and braised beef ribs. It was all good, the mac and cheese was awesome, and the shepherds pie was great. The short ribs were tasty and tender, and my only complaint is that it wasn't hot enough for my taste. Overall I would recommend this place for a lot of different types of nights out.", 
      "We have always had great service at Dublin O'Neil's \u00a0but the more recent changes and fake pub atmosphere finally got to us. They are now trying too hard to compete on too high a level with surrounding restaurants. This was our favorite late evening/late night place to grab a casual meal downtown but the menu now features very non-pub food prices and the portions have suffered along with the price creep. I had two bad food related experiences but kept going back because when everything was good it was a great value, but the last meal was simply underwhelming and terribly overpriced. I contacted management twice, once regarding a serious spoiled seafood issue, and never received a response. No thanks. Not when there is better choice next door.", 
      "I have a mixed opinion on this place. \u00a0I've been there a couple of times for lunch, but never dinner. \u00a0I find the place reasonably priced, and the meal portions quite large (aka, that's a good thing.) \u00a0I've had a chicken pot pie, and some other chicken meal. \u00a0It was like a grilled chicken sandwich. \u00a0Both were very large portions, and are heavier feeling going down. \u00a0 This is rich, savory food. \u00a0Anyway, my chicken pot pie was good, though took long to come out. \u00a0About 40 minutes and it wasn't too busy. \u00a0My chicken breast sandwich came out sooner, but I had to send it back because it was not done in the middle. \u00a0Fortunately it came back better, and I avoided any possible food sickness. \u00a0Service was always friendly, but not always fast. \u00a0Waits were on the longer side, even on non busy days. \u00a0I also had a friend that did get food sickness from some seafood dish from one of the two times I went. \u00a0All and all, not my type of place, but what I experienced was not bad. \u00a0I hear the bar/pub scene of this place is of more appeal than the food, but I only have gone for the food.", 
      "I'll qualify this review by saying that 1) I've only been here once and 2) I got the burger (I'm on a quest to find the best burgers C-U has to offer). The place is nice looking, if a bit small, and the staff was friendly enough. The beer and cider selection is okay, even if they hit you over the head with Guinness all the time. I was expecting an Irish pub, and the place is more upscale than that. The burgers were okay, if a bit dry, but the cheese and bacon on them was overpowering. It wasn't my favorite food in the world, and I've been in better pubs in other places. That said, I didn't go in to try the entrees, and so your experiences may vary.", 
      "Mixed feelings about this place! To be honest the food is a five but the service and atmosphere was a 2, at best. It was a slow night so our waitress decided to leave after taking our order, leaving us in the care of the bartender. She gave us one refill and visited with a really obnoxious, intoxicated girl at the bar about tattoos for the rest of our visit. The intoxicated friend smacked the glasses off the head of the man accompanying her, and called other people at the bar swear words (repeatedly). It started out borderline entertaining but she ended up being the most annoying person we've encountered while eating. \u00a0After a shot, we thought she was gonna fall down...somehow she didn't....Again, the food, no complaints! The Gouda Mac n cheese was amazing and the chicken pot pie was perfect. I'd think someone would want to take care of the other issues before the food isn't enough to bring people in!", 
      "A great local place to eat at. We had the Smoked Gouda Mac& CheeseDublin O'Neils Signature SaldDrunken Bread and Butter Pudding Loved the entire meal and the beers on tap. The service was great as our waitress gave us background on all the beers and helped us decided which we would like the best. The drunken bread and butter pudding is worth trying, it was served warm and was a great way to end the meal.", 
      "Cute, small Irish pub without the pub comfort but with some gastro-pub aspirations. The best thing about Dublin O'Neil's is the shepherd's pie, made with lamb. It's not just good, it's extraordinary. \u00a0Really. Very. Amazing.Also very good are the seafood chowder (cream-based) and the soda bread. We usually also get their curried sweet potato chips (served with a side of sour cream) as an appetizer and have enjoyed their fish and chips (light batter, beautifully cooked fish). \u00a0My boy enjoys their burger.My husband loves the fresh Guinness on tap. The decor is Irish contemporary. The music is often Irish, too, for which we're grateful, being fans of the genre.Other reviewers who say the place is small, the noise level can be loud, and the staff can be slow are all on point. It's better to go when the place isn't packed.Website: dublinoneils.com", 
      "I've been here a few times, and the first time I was pretty happy. They weren't very busy, and we were in and out quickly. However, the next 2 times were just awful. The second time I went the waiter knew about TWO of the beers on the menu. If you're going to carry an extensive beer list, especially with specialty beers that people may be unfamiliar with, PLEASE have a knowledgeable staff. My fish and chips were soggy and I was generally disappointed. Because my first experience was good, I decided they might have had an off day. I gave them another shot, and after an EXTREMELY long wait for both our table and our food, I ended up with a lovely case of food poisoning. From reading other reviews, this isn't an uncommon occurrence. This place had great potential, but poor service and food safety killed it for me.", 
      "Today was the third time I've visited Dublin's. \u00a0All three times I've had the seafood chowder, which is beyond amazing. \u00a0It is so tremendously rich, though, that it makes you a little sick the rest of the day!I've had the fish and chips, which were ok. \u00a0They desperately needed seasoning--and everyone I've spoken to who has ordered it since is in agreement on that. \u00a0The curry sweet potato chips are wonderful! \u00a0Today, my sister and I split the grilled cheese which I didn't particularly like at all. \u00a0It was more toasted than grilled with butter and it was pretty much burned on both sides. \u00a0My sister tried to order a beer listed on the draft list--they were out. \u00a0She tried to order a backup--they were out of that too.", 
      "I've been to Dublin O'Neill's three times now - should have written a review the first two times but did not. \u00a0Our friends wanted to go Tuesday night - husband and I weren't too keen on it given that we didn't just love DO the first two times but they really like it so we went along. \u00a0Like others, like the setting of the place, nice ambiance. \u00a0However, it is so dim that we had trouble seeing the menu - had to hold my cell phone over it so that I could read. \u00a0It would be nice to have a sconce or down-light of some type on the tables for reading the menu and eating. \u00a0On our first visit to DO, I had the mac and cheese. \u00a0I'm a huge mac and cheese lover and maker. \u00a0Sometimes the cheeses used in various recipes are good for some people but not for others. \u00a0The taste just hit me wrong so I must not have liked the flavor of one of the cheeses, not DO's fault. \u00a0Hubby had a burger that time and it just had a strong flavor that he did not like. \u00a0We also had trouble getting drink refills that day. \u00a0Second time we went, sat outside on a lovely summer day. \u00a0This time hubby and friend ordered the fish and chips which they thought was really good. \u00a0I on the other hand ordered the beef short ribs and was sorely, sorely disappointed. \u00a0When the plate was put in front of me, I thought - this is the most unappetizing looking mess I've seen lately on a plate. \u00a0It looked like something that you'd had for dinner the previous night and reheated the next day for lunch. \u00a0It was not heated properly, the gravy was congealed like it had not been heated properly, and the meat was tough. \u00a0I barely ate any of it - when the waitress picked our dishes up, she paused when she saw my plate but then did nothing. \u00a0I read another person's review below that her ribs were also not hot enough. \u00a0I probably should have complained but did not........... thankfully we were going to Jarling's afterwards!So this time, we went on a Tuesday night -- DO was probably only about a third full. \u00a0One lady was waitressing the restaurant. \u00a0My meal was pretty good on this third try but it was the service that struggled this time. \u00a0(I ordered the salmon with red wine reduction sauce, mac and cheese (which was more tolerable, for me, as a side serving than as an entr\u00e9e), and grilled asparagus. \u00a0All was good and the salmon had a nice crispy grilled exterior that I love.) \u00a0The three other people in our group all had fish and chips. \u00a0Compared to last time, the serving size of the fish and chips seemed different / smaller to them. \u00a0One is a big eater so may be last time he'll want to go here. \u00a0The two things that were really off service-wise - a gentleman came to our table, said he was the owner, and could he get any condiments for our meals? \u00a0The three fish-and-chippers asked for ketchup. \u00a0He comes back with a bottle that is barely a quarter full......... really?! \u00a0You have no other ketchup bottles in the restaurant that are fuller than that? \u00a0And he was the owner. \u00a0Afterwards when we talked about it, we thought - what kind of red flag is that for running a restaurant if the owner can't even get you a full bottle of ketchup? \u00a0Then, no salt/pepper shakers on the table, one fish-and-chipper asked for a salt shaker. \u00a0He had received his entr\u00e9e so needed the salt shaker now - waited, waited. \u00a0He was halfway through his meal before a salt shaker showed up. \u00a0We were joking that maybe they only had one for the whole restaurant so we had to wait our turn?! \u00a0What's interesting is that it was announced in the paper that DO is expanding into the space next door. \u00a0They can't seem to handle the service on their current space? \u00a0I suppose DO is successful for the beer side of the restaurant but for the food side - to us, the menu seems small, and what they do have on the menu is sometimes not done well (i.e. the ribs). \u00a0(P.S. \u00a0We also ordered some of the Irish soda bread for an appetizer the first or second time - IMHO it was like buttering up flavorless pieces of cardboard.......... Would never order it again.)", 
      "I will start with the service was excellent. We had a new waitress who was training, \u00a0and she was still great at it. As for the food. My group ordered the irish nachos. They were yummy, \u00a0but the topping to chip ratio was off \u00a0they need to layer some cheese lower, cause the one they use hardens fast, so it's hard to get a bit on each chip. The amount of corn beef could have been slightly more, but it tasted great.My irish breakfast however was a mess. My eggs were burnt, I ordered them sunny side up, and the yolks while runny, we're starting to get that white film over them from being cooked to long, the bottoms were brown and the edges were brown and crispy, I mean this was something that was so obviously wrong. The bangers (sausage) were a bit to vinegary for my taste, and again one was a bit burnt. The tomato was only a few slices and they were super over seasoned, \u00a0all I tasted was a super spicy tomato, they need to hold off on that a lot!. The white and black puddings were tasty. Their rashers also had a burnt taste to them and they were super tough. They look like they had been cooked over a grill, \u00a0it made them taste almost exclusively of charcoal. \u00a0The roasted potatoes... well they turned out to be french fries (super disappointing) \u00a0and the irish soda bread had had a great flavor but was also super dense.", 
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I'm a bit of a sucker for Irish fare in general, but the atmosphere here takes it a step further. Small and intimate with dark woods and nice artistic accents. I've had just about everything on the menu and the only thing I was unimpressed with was the roasted chicken. Definitely try the fisherman's stew! It's sooo goooood. The corned beef and cabbage is amazing, the shepherd's pie is so savory and the bangers and mash are just wonderful. They do a great snakebite too (which down in Chambana is Guinness and cider, not Guinness and Harp)", 
      "I really like this place for two reasons:1. The restaurant & bar remind me of legit-Irish bars that I went to in the nice areas of Dublin. \u00a0The bar and decor are perfect for creating an Irish pub setting to get dinner with your kids or have some beer with your friends or to watch a baseball game at the bar. \u00a02. \u00a0The food is great. \u00a0They have a great brunch menu featuring legit-Irish breakfasts that are the same as the ones I've had in Dublin. \u00a0Their sandwiches and burgers are really good and their mac n cheese is heavenly."

      "I've liked everything I have tried.The sashimi seems fresh.Chef's special sushi or sashimi sampler is the way to go if you don't know what you might like. The fried veggie tempura is a tasty appetizer to try, but not very healthy. If you are worried about calories beware that a lot of rolls have spicy mayo, cream cheese, avocado, or battered/fried fish. not all tho, you can get sashimi or lighter sushi rolls. The only complaint that I have is that they only have one chef, and one night I had to wait almost an hour for my appetizer because they had a 12+ people order placed online ahead of mine. They were very apologetic and gave me a free roll. However, I left after the appetizer (and free roll), and I had planned on spending at least $30 more dollars. So I guess they sometimes have more business than they can handle.", 
      "Restaurant reviewMy quest to find a solid Japanese restaurant unfortunately began here. I do not like to give one star reviews but when the food and price don't match up that is a big let down. I saw a bunch of the positive reviews and negative reviews and decided to give this place a try. The service was nice and friendly which is a huge plus, but the rest was a big let down. Why may you ask...1. My wife got a dragon roll. It was the saddest dragon roll ever. Thinly sliced fish that had a very off color, not vibrant like you would expect and the roll itself was almost falling apart. Check the photos for yourself2. I got the chicken teriyaki with rice. Someone needs to check what the difference is with teriyaki and soy sauce. It felt like chinese stir fried chicken bits. Most japanese restaurants will not dice up the chicken into little cubes and then stir fry it in soy sauce. There was no sweet taste you would expect with real teriyaki sauce and this cost 17.95.... I feel very ripped off!Pro: free small appetizer was given (tempura battered banana and a fish cake of some sort), friendly serviceCons: EXPENSIVE, food is borderline average to belowHidden gem:None", 
      "My friend and I enjoyed dinner here this week. \u00a0The service was great. \u00a0The free apps. were tasty. \u00a0My friend really enjoyed the sushi that he ordered. \u00a0I went with the teriyaki shrimp. \u00a0It was a very generous portion and tasty. \u00a0I asked for it spicy and they delivered, though maybe a bit too much. \u00a0But I got what I asked for so I'm not complaining.", 
      "This was the worst \"Japanese\" food my husband and I have ever had. We ordered 5 maki rolls. The pieces were so small they could not be considered pieces of maki. Two of the rolls supposedly had fish, but most of the pieces of maki had no recognizable fish inside. The rolls were so poorly made that they fell apart when we picked them up with the chopsticks. The taste was terrible. The wasabi wasn't real. It had the consistency of diarrhea and was dyed green. We felt sad after the meal, and cheated out of $45. First and last time ever eating here.", 
      "Good flavor but I can't stand loose rolls that fall apart... \u00a0A bit more work on tightening up would make a big difference... \u00a0Will give them another whirl \u00a0- worth a shot.", 
      "As the 3-star rating reflects, this place is A-OK. Not the best, but okay.I went here on the recommendation of a friend. I've frequently been to Sakanaya on Green Street for sushi though since Sakanaya has been consistently good. When we went in, the decor was nice and clean. Very modern and Asian styled. We were immediately greeted by the waitress. It was a Saturday afternoon and the place wasn't very busy, only 2 other tables were filled. After being seated, we looked over the menus. A lot of the items seemed fairly priced, comparable to Sakanaya's prices, probably cheaper. The service was good. She gave us free bites of appetizers even though we didn't order any and free dessert (watermelon slices). She was very attentive and refilled our water when it was low. She definitely earned a hefty tip.The food was okay, which is why I brought it to the 3 star level. I ordered a sushi entree along with the New York roll and my friend got the bulgogi. The bulgogi was as good as any. The sushi had too much wasabi. The roll was slightly messy too, not neat and tight. If you're looking for a quick bite and for okay Asian food, I would go here. So long as you're not looking to wait at the long lines at Sakanaya, this would be my second choice.", 
      "Overpriced and nothing special.They try hard, but the neighborhood is so ugly and the place is so quiet, when went for lunch it was awkward.", 
      "Very nice sushi, with a long list of complicated rolls, but pricey. \u00a0Fish was fresh and cut well. \u00a0I enjoyed everything I tried - raw and cooked.Don't let the exterior fool you. \u00a0Heck, don't let the interior fool you!", 
      "I have dined here many times over the years and I have always had a great experience. The best sushi in town, small and intimate dining area. I find the location wonderful. It is in a little out of the way strip mall, sort of behind an IGA. This really adds to the experience of finding a hidden gem.Great food, great experience. Just go and order whatever you want, you will be glad you went.", 
      "Very nice inside. Service great, and sushi very fresh. Had the Chef's Special Roll. Great!", 
      "So unimpressed.I came here with two friends. \u00a0One had been hesitant to eat here as last time he had found a bone in his sushi, but we figured 'hey, it happens!' and gave yellowfin a chance. \u00a0Worst. \u00a0Decision. Ever. \u00a0Between the three of us we found 4+ bones in our sushi. \u00a0 The sushi was painfully average and the ratio of wasabi to rice in the nigiri was either too weak or too strong. \u00a0Speaking of wasabi, theirs had this weird gritty consistency to it - kind of like when you make a paste with flour. \u00a0And it was really, really weak. \u00a0Ick. I'm not even sure the agedashi tofu we ordered contained tofu - it was this weird mess of over fried... something? \u00a0batter? panko? And resembled little crumpled piece of paper. \u00a0Yeah no. \u00a0Not good.We were seated at the bar which also doubled as the area where food was served from. \u00a0It was interesting to see the number of orders that had to be brought back or changed because the chef had forgotten something. \u00a0It was extra interesting to watch the plates get passed over my friend's head while we are trying to have dinner. Our server ensured we had plenty of time to talk by being completely inattentive. \u00a0It took him easily 15-20 minutes just to take our order and then we waited... and waited... and waited for the food to come out. \u00a0Thankfully my friends are good company or the wait would have been excruciatingly painful. \u00a0The one time he did check up on us we mentioned all the bones we had found and his response was to nod, do a little laugh, shrug and walk off. \u00a0Right. \u00a0I must have missed that becoming an appropriate reaction. \u00a0My bad.All in all a bad experience. \u00a0Never again.", 
      "I had always been a 5 star fan of yellowfin, until one day.I am probably one of the more tolerant restaurant customers giving servers, and restaurants the benefit of the doubt. \u00a0It's true that sometimes servers have bad days and are grumpy, and that's no problem, we've all been there. \u00a0There are also sometimes mistakes in food, and likewise, a chef or sushi chef could be having a bad day.Still... when I was serve edamame in my lunch bento... and there were literally maggots coming out of the edamame... i was pretty horrified. \u00a0It was definitely one of those situations where you know the food is old. \u00a0The edamame was lifeless, brown, old. \u00a0And to my surprise, there were maggots in it having at it.So being as tempered as possible, I alerted the server who apologized and took it away. \u00a0I was expecting one of two things... 1, the server (or owner) will come to the table, apologize, and comp my meal. \u00a02, nothing will happen until I receive the check, and the meal will be comped on there with some kind of apology note.By the time the check came, neither of the two happened. \u00a0Giving the restaurant one more chance to make right their wrong, I politely asked if I could get my meal comped since there were maggots in my food. \u00a0The server responded politely that the owner said there was no way for anyone to know there were maggots in the edamame. \u00a0Even though the edamame was all pretty much opened up with maggots coming out of them when it reached the table in the first place.So... there you go, I gave every chance for them to make right their wrong. \u00a0Suffice it to say that getting maggots in your food is a totally unacceptable situation, they took it 3 steps too far by doing nothing about it before the check, on the check, or after the check. \u00a0By principle alone, and from fear that the rice, or even fish are likely aging beyond their safe tolerance levels, yellowfin gets a 0 star if I could give them one for committing egregious health code violations, and donig nothing about it.", 
      "If you want higher quality sushi in the Urbana-Champaign area, skip Sushi Rock or that joke of an \"upscale\" restaurant, Kofusion.Yellowfin is a solid choice when you are looking at rolls or sashimi.PROS:+ Sashimi options are above average in selection; they have fatty tuna, market price of about $10-11 for 2 pieces+ Rolls are creative and taste great+ They can READ MINDS!! That or somehow they figured out that it was my girlfriend's birthday dinner and delivered her rolls on a bamboo stand with candles stuck in wasabi balls hahaCONS:- Entrees such as the teppanyaki all fail miserably short in flavor, quality, and consistency- If there are more than 3 tables filled, the restaurant gets overwhelmed and you can expect a dramatic fall off in service and increase in wait times for your food- Miso soup is blandI agree with the other reviewer that lamented the fact that the rice was a little sloppy on the rolls and nigiri. I agree that sushi is an art, but when you're in southeastern Illinois in the middle of the cornfields with Korean sushi chefs, sometimes you just have to lower your expectations on good lookin' sushi. If fresh fish and rolls are what you're looking for, look no further than Yellowfin.The restaurant is run by Koreans, and they seem to be understaffed in the front as well as the back. However, service is attentive when it's not too busy, and the servers are college-age and friendly.There is a Korean market right next door and I would highly recommend stopping by to pick up some groceries or just great Asian junk food like Shin Ramen or those delectable Asian funyuns.Come here on a date or with a small group of friends for the good quality and selection of sashimi and rolls; the ambiance at night is intimate when it's not full. They have large bottles of all 3 major Japanese beers (Asahi, Sapporo, Kirin) for your enjoyment as well.", 
      "The idea of eating sushi in the middle of Illinois is a little scary to me... I mean, how close is the closest ocean exactly?...But after reading good things about Yellowfin, I thought I'd give it a try and see for myself. The restaurant is a little out of the way, but apparently it doesn't keep the \"crowds\" from coming: I went on a Monday night with terrible weather, and the restaurant was still relatively busy. Not too much to say about the place itself: the deco could definitely use more work, and it kind of looks like a cheap Chinese restaurant (with the exception of the sushi bar). But who really cares... The menu is pretty extensive, with mostly Japanese food (and a lot of sushi) but also some Korean items. I ordered the salmon teriyaki combo ($15), which turned out to be a lot more food than I expected: salmon filet and sauteed vegetable in teriyaki sauce, white rice, three pieces of sushi (tuna, salmon, shrimp), salad, a California roll, miso soup, and a scoop of ice-cream!! Needless to say I was full after finishing all that food. And while it wasn't necessarily exceptional, it was pretty good overall and I left satisfied. Not bad for the price.", 
      "This is a 3.5 star review. \u00a0I waffled on whether I should give them three stars or four, but I really think that they could improve on a few things, and settled on three stars.The Good- The space is small, but not tightly-packed- Our waitress was sweet and friendly- The chef sent us a free dish - tempura-fried seaweed-wrapped whitefish garnished with octopus (squid?) tentacles. \u00a0It was very good, and a nice gesture.- The maki we ordered (Spider, Silk Road, and Crazy rolls) were very tastyThe Not-as-Good- The space is small, so every time the door opened, freezing cold air blasted in- The waitress was understandably busy, as she was the only one working the whole restaurant, but this meant that she couldn't give much attention to any one table- The appetizer we ordered, shumai, was so close to being really tasty - it was five pork-filled dumplings with a wasabi sauce. \u00a0Now, I love wasabi, but it overwhelmed the sauce and made it difficult to taste the dumpling itself.- The maki was kind of...I don't know...sloppily-rolled? \u00a0Two of the three rolls we ordered were pretty big and tended to fall apart.Champaign isn't exactly a booming sushi metropolis, so I'll be back...hopefully they can bump my experience up a star!", 
      "Don't let the outside fool you, Yellowfin is a hidden gem. \u00a0I was skeptical at first since KoFusion and others are solid sushi choices in the area. \u00a0However, I'm always out for the best. \u00a0Inside, Yellowfin is actually a quaint little place. \u00a0It's a LOT smaller than the other sushi joints. \u00a0There are about eight tables and a sushi bar. \u00a0Don't be fooled by the size though, the sushi is great. \u00a0Everything was fresh and they even use real crab. \u00a0The sushi selection is expansive and very reasonably priced. \u00a0They also serve sushi in to-go ramekins rather than pouches. \u00a0Just a little like of mine :) \u00a0Those pouches are never enough! \u00a0The only problem I had with Yellowfin is that the sushi was not rolled very well. \u00a0The pieces were loose and falling apart when I ate them. \u00a0So good it doesn't matter though :)", 
      "This is gotta be my favorite Japanese joint in Chambana! I love how the place isn't really located in a very commercial area.. which makes the place a true hidden gem and you gotta look for it. The place is small, gives you that at home feel for some reason. The waitress is extremely sweet and nice, so does the other staff. Rice quality is OK, they really hold the fish/shrimp and veggies together better than other japanese joints where their rice don't hold the content that very well. Sushi may take awhile if there are a lot of people since there's only 1 sushi chef, but very worth the wait. (Last time me and my sister went there, there were actually 2 of them. So maybe that will help the wait lol)Another favorite thing about this restaurant is how they give you free stuff on certain days. We got free seaweed salad, miso soup, tempura banana, and even a 6 pc sushi roll from the chef on different days! They got the best mochi ice cream ever, extremely cold but very good. Their fried rice is addicting for some reason, very different from all the stuff I've tasted.Teppan grill is good, although it seems like they kept changing the portion everytime we go there. Now when they serve the rice, they put it on the plate upside down when I really prefer it on the small bowl so I can \"cup\" it with my chopstick easily. I haven't tried their Korean items but will someday!I will always come back to this place and I can't wait to take my BF from Frisco here! :)", 
      "Although Japanese cuisine is far from my favorite , \u00a0I do like Yellowfin a lot. \u00a0Their sushi lunches are affordable and good. \u00a0I always get the vegetarian plate and it comes with California rolls, wasabi, seaweed, and tempura vegetables. They serve soda by the can, which is a drag because I usually like one refill on my pop and I like the taste of fountain drinks better. I also could live without the loud contemporary Christian music which always seems to be playing. \u00a0(I have nothing against Christian music but I don't like loud music while I'm eating.) A nice cafe if you're in the mood for it.", 
      "By a strange set of circumstances, I ended up going here three times in less than a week. \u00a0So I got to try a lot of different things. \u00a0In short: rolls are great, nigiri is okay, bulgoogi is good but a little pricey.Overall, it's a solid place. \u00a0I still like Sushi Kame just a little better, but it's a lot closer than it used to be. \u00a0The rolls (maki) are the way to go here - they're really good, and there's some clever combinations. \u00a0The ume jiso is a sour paste, mint, and cucumber - it's awesome, the sour flavor is extremely intense and unlike any other sushi roll I've had. \u00a0The crazy roll is really good, too, and so is the unagi. \u00a0The tempura squid is also tasty. \u00a0The prices are pretty reasonable definitely in line with most of the other sushi places in C-U, and cheaper than Ko-fusion. \u00a0It's nice that they have a good selection of different entrees - even people who aren't crazy about raw fish can find something to eat here.I do not recommend the nigiri (where you get a piece of fish on top of a little \"cake\" of pressed rice) so highly. \u00a0My girlfriend and I split a Sushi special and the amount of wasabi on some of the rolls was overwhelming. \u00a0I like wasabi, but there shouldn't be so much on the nigiri when it comes out that your sinuses burn and your eyes tear up. \u00a0It really overwhelms the flavor of the fish at that point. \u00a0At first we thought it was because they were so busy, but a friend got the same thing on our second visit, and there was still too much wasabi. \u00a0Also, though the sushi special gives you a lot of pieces for the price, there were some repeats - 2 shrimp, and 2 tilapia, which I think are some of the cheaper fish. \u00a0Neither was all that flavorful. \u00a0Because of this, I think Sushi Kame is still better when it comes to nigiri.The bulgoogi is good, and comes out with veggies - looked like carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, onions. \u00a0However, at $14 it seems a little pricey. \u00a0I didn't have it, but another friend got the teriyaki chicken, and the portion was very large.They do some special things like bring out complementary seafood pancakes before the meal, and desserts like tempura bananas and oranges. \u00a0That is nice. \u00a0Service really depends on who's working and how busy they are. \u00a0It's generally not really fast - I only saw the one sushi chef working when I was there - so that's something to be prepared for. \u00a0One friend was there for her birthday, and they brought out little candles stuck in wasabi for her, so that was a nice touch.If you like sushi and you stick with the rolls, you'll get the most out of this place. \u00a0I recommend the rolls pretty highly - they're probably the best I've had in town, and like I said, prices are reasonable. They're also one of the few sushi or Asian restaurants open on Monday, which is nice to know when your week is off to a bad start and you really want a sushi fix.", 
      "Yellowfin was a lot nicer than I expected. The outside is a strip mall on the edge of campus, but when you enter the door it's actually pretty nice and well-decorated. I'm not a Sushi aficionado (yet), but what I tried was delicious. I got a Bento box, which was much cheaper than Kofusion's, but also had less food. Mine contained terayaki salmon, tasty vegetables, a rather bland iceberg salad, rice, and a delicious cucumber-sesame salad. There was an option to add on California rolls for $2.00. The menu is extensive, so you can bring your sushi-adverse friends and order soba or Korean BBQ. Service was attentive and in the end, the bill was surprisingly low. Too bad it's so out of the way. I think with their long menu I could go here over and over again.", 
      "Yummy! This and Kofusion are probably my two favorite places for sushi/Japanese food in the Champaign-Urbana area. At lunchtime, they have great sushi meals that come with salad, cucumbers, potstickers or some other assorted item, as well as the awesome rolls that are served up. The price is pretty good considering the amount of food (I usually have a take-home box). For dinner, my husband and I either go for our respective entree preferences (mine being ramen, his being... well, it varies) plus a roll, or we get a few different rolls to split. The sushi chef always gives us an appetizer on the house (can vary from cucumbers with a light soy sauce, to squid) and sometimes there is dessert like fruit, mochi, fried banana, etc.Sometimes when things get busy, service can take a really long time. However, the quality of the food more than makes up for any negative experiences I've had. This is a must-eat place in Champaign-Urbana!", 
      "This is my favorite sushi in Chambana. \u00a0I will not bother to repeat what the other posters have stated, but in my 3 visits I have found the rolls to be expertly rolled, the fish to be fresh, and the prices to be reasonable. The decor is no Ko-Fusion, but it is elegant and I think that if you compared their prices side-by-side, this would come out on top my more than a few cents.1 in 3 times service was questionable, as it seemed like our order got ignored in favor of a big party, but I forgave them when I got their \"I'm Sorry\" salad and my fat rolls.", 
      "As a recent transplant to the area from California, I am on a serious hunt for a great sushi place. Yellowfin was just about as satisfactory as Sushi Kame in my opinion, and neither of them really blew my mind.Granted I got take out and by the time I arrived home the fish was practically room temperature (it was sitting on the counter when I arrived.) I understand the results of rice in the refrigerator, but \u00a0give a shorter pick-up time so that it is not prepared after 10 minutes and then sitting out for 15.Many of the reviews for these places rave about the rolls, and for good reason. A sushi roll does some really great things for masking the quality of the fish you are using. Toss in some mayo, masago, and cucumber and it all tastes the same. My nigiri left sooo sooo much to be desired. The tuna was dark and stringy, the salmon almost flavorless, and the rest of the assortment was dry and average. Secondly, too...much...wasabi. Each piece had a huge amount underneath the fish...my sinuses may never be the same. After a few pieces I began disassembling everything to wipe off some of it in order to actually taste the fish.The one roll that really made me smile was the spicy tuna. Rarely do sushi joints use the right amount of mayonnaise, and this one surprisingly does. It was creamy, but not overly so. I cannot speak for any of the cooked food but I am sure they are fine. My personal mission is finding good fish...and I understand the difficulties of that in central Illinois, but I haven't given up yet!", 
      "The sushi was good but I was expecting a better experience from what i had heard. Decor/ambience not up to the price level.", 
      "I've been here quite a few times in the past year. Top-notch service, outstanding sushi. Thank you Yellowfin. Keep up the good work.", 
      "For years I was fooled by this restaurant's nondescript yellow exterior. The inside is clean and well maintained with small touches of oriental decor---nothing exquisite, though certainly adequate.Tonight I had the Philadelphia rolls and vegetable yakisoba. (I was a little disappointed this order doesn't include miso soup.) The yakisoba seemed a little heavy on grease and sauce but tasted fine. Although prices appeared reasonable, portions were tiny and barely satiating.Service is good. Our waitress tonight was friendly and attentive, and based on my past experiences here, this tends to be the norm.There's really nothing wrong with Yellowfin---it's very much a hidden gem and one of Champaign's top spots for Japanese cuisine. That said, nothing about this restaurant strikes me as exceptional, so I'm going to go with a solid four out of five stars.", 
      "The first time going here was on a busy weekend night, where the entire place was only staffed by one person. It took a while of standing at the front to even get noticed, then forever to get our food. I can only assume that there was a staffing crisis, because the next time I went, there were 2 waiters, and it was on a much less busy weekday night.We were immediately noticed and seated, and our order was taken promptly and cheerfully. Our appetizers came out really quick, then our food immediately afterwards. This was really fast, because let me tell you, when we order sushi, we order a TON. Like, surely-they're-making-fun-of-the-fat-Americans-\u00adback-in-the-kitchen amounts. \u00a0My only complaint for this visit was the noise level. \u00a0It seemed as though there was some kind of a reunion going on at the table next to ours, which had at least 10 people at it. \u00a0They were all getting pretty sauced and obnoxious. \u00a0This really wasn't the fault of the restaurant, but it's so small that they were drowning out our conversation, if not all of the conversations in the restaurant.All of the sushi was right on. It was expensive, but isn't it always?", 
      "From the outside, this place's looks are *not* impressive. Entering, though, you find that this is a good and popular spot for sushi, etc.Visiting a couple weeks ago, my wife and I had a couple of fairly unusual and quite tasty maki: Amigo (redolent of cilantro) and Illini (with Italian herbed oil). We really enjoyed the spicy tuna dish appetizer, and tempura appetizer.On the other hand, the green tea was not hot, barely warm. And, the combination of popularity, close tables, and hard surfaces made the place extremely noisy. Once the crowd died down and the restaurant was 1/3 full, conversation could again be carried on without shouting.This was probably our third time, and won't be the last. But, we'll try to go during off-peak hours to avoid the noise.", 
      "I really wish I had tried Yellowfin before my last week in Champaign. It looks a pretty sketch from the outside, but on the inside it's really nice looking, though small. \u00a0We ordered 3 rolls to share between the 2 of us, and it was a little too much food-- but, we were also sent multiple items from the chef, white and red tuna, and then a tempura fried banana for dessert.Some of the rolls were a little bit loose, but it didn't bother me. \u00a0The fish was absolutely delicious. \u00a0They have rolls for both new sushi eaters (my companion) and more adventurous ones (myself). \u00a0Overall I think it's a great little place and will be going back when I'm in town.", 
      "The sushi rice was a bit dry, but the fish on the nigiri special was good. The chirashi sushi rice interestingly was not dry for some reason. I must have gotten to rice at the bottom of the cooker.Next door is a well stocked korean super market. Neat place to go to pick up something to cold to drink on the road home.", 
      "Best Japanese restaurant in town. Great food at reasonable price!Will return soon!", 
      "Best place in town for Japanese food. Great food, great staff and prices are a littler cheaper than other restaurants where you pay for the ambiance.beef teriaki combo during lunch hours is delicious and portion is large. Many types of rolls I've tried are excellent.", 
      "Best place for sushi in ChampaignQuaint atmosphere good food decent price. Very likeable service friendly waiters free complimentary dessert if you come for dinner occasionally :)", 
      "I've been going to Yellowfin as my \"sushi place\" (once every 2-3 weeks) for about a year. Initially, I was just happy to have an option that wasn't incredibly overpriced and over-focused on fancy tempura-laden rolls. Simple sushi is where its at, and its what they do well.Unfortunately, the quality of their food has only gone down, and after tonight I'm not going to be taking my business there anymore. We got into the restaurant around 6:50pm. Not peak dinner-time, but still kind of crowded in the small space. There was ONE waiter working the 6-7 tables there, and he was clearly being run ragged. He provided decent customer service given his situation, and was definitely handling it as well as he could.No amount of customer service can make up for crappy food and unsatisfying portions, though. The \"combo\" platters are little more than some type of protein (shrimp, scallops, chicken, beef, or tofu), and some vegetables thrown into a wok that might have had soy sauce in it at some point during the day. No kidding, I don't think there was even teriyaki sauce on there...just soy sauce. I can, and do, make better stir fry at home. Their sushi is small, but they serve it nice and cold, which is a step up from other restaurants in the area. The fish is of decent quality (re: it won't kill you), but today I noticed that the portions of fish had gotten even tinier over the last few months. I think the chef was slicing the fish in half lengthwise, it was so thin!They do not include soup and salad with your meal, unless it is one of the above-mentioned combo platters. This is garbage. Soup/salad is par for the course for most places now, and no amount of icky tempura-fried banana and slim pieces of fruit served as \"dessert\" can account for that. The salad dressing for the house salad tastes like water, and they use it like soup; my lettuce was SWIMMING. Pros: cold sushi, well-flavored rolls and nigiri, and a lot of optionsCons: # of waiters available, soup/salad for extra charge, super tiny portions, and very overpriced. I won't be back. There isn't much in the way of sushi in Chambana, but there is better than this.", 
      "Great sushi place. Definitely the epitome of a hidden gem, as the outside is deceiving. The menu is extensive, and the prices are affordable. The sushi rolls were all very good, with an artful presentation. We received complimentary edimame at the beginning, a free small \"appetizer\" bowl of a few pieces of raw tuna with our order of rolls, and a complimentary dessert of green tea ice cream with a rice cake coating (just the right portion size for two people, and a nice surprise end to the meal). Chefs/the waitress were friendly as we were leaving as well. Very satisfied with the experience.", 
      "First of all, I'm a daughter of a Sushi Chef so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to Sushi.I had a Chirashizushi at Yellow Fin, it's a assortment box of sashimi topped on rice. 1. Over Priced - I had same stuff atleast 4 dollars cheaper2. Weird Stuff inside - pickled carrots / furikake stuff traditionally NOT found in Chirashizushi were presentand most important3. Old sashimi - I smelled a piece of the sashimi, smelled like fish! (i mean, the unpleasent smell of fish going bad) probably raw fish that stayed in the fridge for 3 days.I only went to yellowfin once and I choose Chirashizushi cause I can try different types of sashimi they sereve. Probably never going back there unless I'm hanging out with 10 friends who're craving for yellow fin.", 
      "Best sushi in chambana. You wouldn't know it from the outside but it is amazing. My boyfriend and I go here a few times a month and have never been disappointed and that's saying something. We haven't found a consistent place in the city yet except for yellowfin.", 
      "The atmosphere is conducive to conversation and makes it a good place to meet up. Fair-to-Good quality sushi at normal prices, though there are lunch combos which give a good amount of sushi for the price point. Service was responsive, though the wait for food was a bit longer than I would have liked. Overall, OK.", 
      "If I were rating Yellowfin in comparison to all the other Japanese restaurants in ONLY Champaign-Urbana, I would give it 3. \u00a0Here's why Yellowfin gets 2 stars:-The size of the nigirizushi was small, particularly the rice. \u00a0The cut of the fish was fine, but the rice underneath was way too small.-The rice was sloppily formed. \u00a0The rolls had rice poking out from both ends past the seaweed and the nigirizushi rice was not properly formed. \u00a0Now, this isn't to say that the rolls didn't taste good, because they did; however, presentation is very important when is comes to Japanese cuisine.-The nigirizushi was placed on top of a bamboo leaf. \u00a0Now this looked nice, but bamboo leaves have a very distinct taste and it definitely added a strange flavor to the nigirizushi rice.-The sushi platters did not come with miso soup or a salad. \u00a0This should be included in the meal because Japanese meals don't just consist of one large plate. \u00a0There are always small elements to be included, like a salad or soup. \u00a0These you had to pay extra for for a ridiculous price for its size. \u00a0This I disliked more than anything.Anyways, I hope this review helps.", 
      "I was waffling between a 4 and a 5 on this place out of the 3 times I've been here, but last night really pushed me to a 5! We came for a birthday party (we had a reservation for 6.. but it wound up being 8 and they accommodated us with no questions asked.. +1!) at around 6 on a Saturday, and there were only 2 other tables seated in the restaurant. Service started out a little shaky (our waiter was quite young), but nothing to complain about, really. Once we were all seated and had our orders placed, the evening just went really smoothly (which is really how parties at restaurants should be, I think). Though the rolls took a while to come out (we all ordered sushi in one form or another), we were sent out first a round of complimentary miso soup, and then trays of beautifully presented banchan (or Japanese food presented in banchan style). Our sushi came out pretty much all at the same time (though the waiter forgot one of my friend's second roll order until the end). I've only had the sushi here, so I can't speak for the hot food, but it is very fresh tasting and has clean flavor profiles. It seems to be that the majority of the rolls are dominated by fish and veggies rather than cream cheese/tempura style rolls, which is a nice break from some of the other restaurants in town. In my opinion, the rolls are on the pricey side ($6 for a simple maki to avg $13 for a 'special'), but I come from the land of cheap fish, so Yellowfin is competitive for the market in town. Finally, the chef sent out some tempura bananas topped with mango sauce and caramel. If you've not had a tempura banana, you're really missing out! I guess what impressed me the most was 1) how seamless the service integrated with the table's needs and 2) the effort put into the presentation and quality of the food. We were able to enjoy our night out without having to worry too much about really anything.. everything just flowed. The sushi was beautifully presented, with beautiful pieces of fish as well as intricately carved garnishes.Bottom line: When a sushi craving hits any day other than a Sunday or Monday, I'll be headed to Yellowfin"

      "Great burger, with great fries (unfortunately extra -- the tortilla chips it comes with by default are good, but seriously it seems like a cop-out). The waiters were knowledgeable and friendly, but not overbearing. The vibe is, as people say, dark but cool, and it is very difficult to spot if you don't already know where it is.One weird moment -- the first time we ever went to Farren's, my gf asked the waiter for a beer recommendation and received a \"Wheach\" -- a Peach Wheat. This was a very good selection, as it combines two of her favorite things: fruit-flavored beer and puns. The next time we went back, she asked for the Wheach -- and the waiter had no idea what we were talking about. Not \"we're out\" or \"it's no longer in season\" or \"we no longer carry that\" -- he had never heard of it. All of the beer we've gotten there since has been solid, but we never saw the Wheach again....", 
      "Pretty much upon entry I was congratulated for finding the place. It is set back and between a parking garage and some other building, but it is painted bright green... I think that is what helped me! This place is super casual. The tables and chairs are not very aesthetically pleasing, but i guess it gets the job done. I ordered the grilled scallop salad (because when the guy next to me ordered it and I decided immediately that is what I wanted as well). I am so glad I copied him. This salad was sooo good. Mixed greens. Sweet fruity dressing, Tasty scallops. Walnuts. Strawberries. Grapes. I also think that most salads like this use either feta or goat cheese, but this salad had Parmesan cheese which I think was perfect because the other cheeses I find to be too overwhelming sometimes. Also make sure you get the crackers that come with the salad! Apparently, their burgers are good too.... Maybe next time!", 
      "Generally, I don't like burgers or blue cheese but The Russell is pretty awesome combination of the two. Specifically, the blue cheese sauce is really what makes the burger awesome; you can put the sauce on anything and it will taste great. Farrens is not easily located as the entrance is down an alley. I think it is probably an attempt to keep the campus kids out and create an environment that is more for the locals, which can be nice.The place is small but our group of five was easily able to get a table on a Thursday night. The service was pretty decent, and it didn't take long to get our food. In my opinion, the tricolor chips were better than the house fries but I am probably in the minority on that one. Overall, I think it is worthwhile to come here and try a burger with the blue cheese sauce. Next time, I will have to try the Russell with the Kobe beef patty.", 
      "I walked in with my sister and one of our friends a few weeks ago, at about 9:30 pm on a Friday night because we were hungry and wanted to go someplace where we could have a burger and a beer, and because we all love Farrens. Well, the only people there were the bartender and the waitress who sighed loudly and called to us that they close at ten. Wow. She may as well have said \" YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE. GO AWAY!\" so, we turned and left. Frankly, I'm not sure when we will go back. I don't like feeling unwelcome and I'm rather sure we could have ordered and eaten within their time remaining.SO Farrens? I used to love you, but since it's not reciprocated... Well, now? Not so much. \u00a0:p", 
      "Im gonna sum this up quickly. Booooo!!!! Service/serve was ok, food WASNOT worth what they were charging (cold fries and hard ass bread on the philly cheese steak sandwich). AND I smell like a resturant! Ugh! Won't go back nor will I suggest anyone go there.", 
      "The space is pretty tight here, but if you avoid the lines, you'll be satisfied. Hamburgers are their specialty, with the \"Russell\" as their house style.", 
      "Love me some Farren's. Always considered one of the best luncheon spots in downtown Champaign. From the perfect hand cut fries to the over the top burgers.", 
      "One of my favorite places to eat out in CU.As an alumni of UIUC, I find this place to be fairly priced with decent service. They have a solid draft selection as well as a well-rounded menu.Food: 5/5 (Remember, if you're not a chip-person, you can always change it out for fries for few cents! The Spicoli is the first-timer's go-to. However, I personally like it a little hot. You'll see what I mean when you get there. Their *real* [emphasis on that] Ginger Ale is real. Seriously. Burns like a mother, but still good.)Price: A full meal with a draft and tip will be ~$10-15 per person, assuming that you get a burger. I'm not quite sure about the appetizers. But, it's definitely not a bad price.Mood: A little dark. Has more of a darker, but cheerful, environment compared to other bars.Service: I found the service to be good. No remarkable situations or anything necessarily outstanding compared to your expected service for restaurant in this tier.Other comments: Definitely recommended to visit at least once. If you and couple of your buddies want some decent burgers, this is one of the places to go. Might as well pay here, then go to Five-Guys to waste your money or any other corporate burger shops.", 
      "The Russell is a must have. I recommend getting it with a Kobe patty.", 
      "I was desperate to try this place. It's has a tiny front and is easily missed because of the towering parking garage next to it. So, anyway, I was desperate to try this place and I made it 30 minutes before closing. Dear Gwen M., I don't know who your host was but when we walked in we asked if it was all right to order since they were so close to closing. The host was warm and welcomed us in. I ordered a black bean burger that was the best veggie burger I've ever had. There was some sort of roux sauce on the side that was equally phenomenal. I came her a second time with my parents who ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a bison burger. Neither of these were so great. They were a bit gamey. But I'll never forget you, my black bean.", 
      "Honestly, I'm a pretty big foodie and this was the best meal I've had in Champaign. Be sure to get the homemade potato chips - TO DIE FOR. I had the Spicoli Burger with crumbled bleu cheese - it was out of this world, and also so unexpected for a little hole in the wall joint. Go with an empty stomach because portions are large and you will not be wanting to leave anything uneaten.", 
      "Service was great, very attentive even if they were swamped. Maybe it's my fault because I ordered a burger that was too spicy for me to handle, but I expected a lot better. Will definitely visit again and get something that is easier to enjoy.", 
      "My favorite burger in town, especially with a side of bleu cheese sauce. Chips and fries are both made in house and are pretty good. Onion rings don't come close to the cost. Fish has been okay. I wish they had better bread for everything.I can only go three stars for dumb things like the upcharge on fries, the grease-covered floors and spotty service. Some of the waitstaff are just jerks. \"Hey, can I have an extra bleu cheese sauce, please?\"\"You already have one.\"\"Yes. I would like another.\"Giant eyeroll and 15 minutes to get it, despite the empty bar. They do suffer from some, \"Our reputation will cover my ass,\" I think. Nope...you still have to be polite, even if I want to buy enough sauce to bathe in. There are a lot of other places to eat in CU.", 
      "Favorite bar food in all of CU! Also, my favorite burgers. Anything with blue-cheese and/or bacon is a winner. It does have its quirks, though. The service is pretty impersonal, which I personally love because its fast and efficient, but people I've brought there have been turned off by it. Always pay extra for the fries--not sure why they cost extra but they're pretty tasty. Be prepared to wait on the weekends, but don't be terrified by the length of the line as tables turn over quick.", 
      "This place is great. \u00a0Simple menu and the food is excellent if you're looking for a good burger and fry.", 
      "They have the second best burger in town, after black dog. But their burgers are great and flavorful. I can never eat fast food burgers any more. They also have a good beer selection. I like the \"hole in the wall\" feel since this place can be hard to find for first timers.", 
      "Farrens is a great place to eat! The hummus plate is very tasty, all the veggies on the plate are fresh cut. The burgers are top notch! The Kobe burger and Fries is one of the best Burger meals i have ever had. The salad just finishes the meal. A must try in Champaign!", 
      "Farren's has an awesome burger. My burger had a very thick patty, bleu cheese, bacon, saut\u00e9ed onions, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, lettuce, and onion. The patty was very thick and juicy, and the buns were fantastic. The burgers come with tortilla chips, but you can substitute the chips for fries or onion rings at an additional cost. The burger alone costs between $8-9, and you will be paying around $9-13 for your entire meal, depending on what extras/substitutes you get. I will definitely be coming back here again.", 
      "Exceedingly mediocre experience. I've heard numerous rave reviews about this \"hidden gem\" but after eating here I'm truly puzzled. Am I in the right place?Poor beer, wine and food selection (as in no selection). We tried the fried ravioli which were served on a bed of wilting lettuce. The mediocrity pushed us to ask if they were made in house-- our server told us no with an apologetic smile. Then why exactly am I paying upwards of $9 for this frozen bullshit? We had a real good laugh about all the upcharges for our choice of side. Tortilla chips come standard and it's extra for fries?! Cmon. I really should have known something was amiss when our server neglected to ask how we would like our burgers cooked. The bacon on my burger was undercooked and chewy, while the patty was wayyy overcooked. No pink in sight. Be sure to check out Farrens if you don't have any taste buds or standards for your dining experience!", 
      "Seriously. Best burgers in town. The black burger is BOMB! Without that cajun remoulade, it's delicious, but with it, FREAKIN' FANTASTIC! The fresh house made potato chips are like crack with the black truffle sea salt they use. My heart was almost broken when they were sold out of chips, but the server (also the owner) said they could add the crack...erm... salt.. to the house cut fries. Wasn't quite the same, but it was still very tasty. Service isn't always super friendly, but I don't care when I get the best burger and chips in town. The burgers aren't the only good part. They have daily specials that have always been satisfying and unique. They also have some stellar dark beers. Wait time can be a little long depending on when you come, but it's worth the wait.", 
      "Just like all other reviews, I had the Kobe burger and it was absolutely delicious. I love the open atmosphere. We've never had to wait in the two times we've been there, however I have noticed both times it seems to be FREEZING in the restaurant. Its slightly pricey, but the food is well worth it. And the fries. The FRIES! They come without salt but the salt on the table is flakey instead of crystals, which really does make a difference. And it's a wonderful difference.", 
      "Only fries in champaign i can have with my soy, gluten allergy. And they are amazeballs! \u00a0fresh cut potatoes fried in canola oil...yes please! I'm enjoying an order now . I always order to go tho because the place is underground, dark , with no windows...and the outside dining is located next to dumpsters :/", 
      "A little place tucked away in an alley? It's worth a try, right? I went here with a group of friends on a Friday night. It looked busy when we walked in but we had no problem getting a table for the 5 of us. I loved the variety of draft beers here and enjoyed trying out a few as well as trying sips of my friend's drinks. The menu had a lot of options but it looked like the star of the show was the burgers so I went with the Green Chile Burger. \u00a0I thought it might be too spicy but it ended up being not bad at all and I think it could have actually used more kick. \u00a0The fries were delicious. We did have a little mess-up with our order when a friends didn't get her onion rings, but as soon as we notified our server of the error, he apologized and went to put in an order for the missing rings. We also had to switch servers halfway through our meal (not sure what happened to our first guy, maybe his shift was over?), but we had no problems still getting our correct checks.", 
      "Food is always top notch. The burger is by far the best on CU and probably one of the best I've ever had. The homemade chips are a must and are definitely worth the $2 extra on the bill and don't skip out on the hummus or craft brew. The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is the service. It can be pretty inconsistent and when it's bad, it's really bad.", 
      "When I travel I try to find unique dining experiences that I can't find at home. One of my clients recommended this place and I'm glad I came. While I miss my wife and wish she were here w me, I'm glad she didn't see me licking my fingers tonight. I ordered \"The Russell\" burger and was tantalized w the entire experience. It had saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, pepperjack cheese and a blue cheese sauce that was finger licking good. Sorry Honey :( I added fresh house cut fries that were still sizzling when they were served. Professional staff. Kinda friendly. Cool environment and decent prices. I highly recommend this place. If there's one down side it's that I had to pay for parking. Bring quarters or park in the garage next door.", 
      "Best food I've had in C-U thus far. Went on a Friday night in October with my sister. Had a burger that was covered in pulled pork, bacon, and cheese. AMAZING. (a heart attack waiting to happen, but so good!) My sister had a chicken pesto wrap thing that was also fresh and yummy. Great seasoned fries. Good bottled beer selection. I'll be back!", 
      "Them burgers is huge, boy. \u00a0And tasty! \u00a0Way better than a Royale with cheese!. \u00a0Or a Big Kahuna Burger. \u00a0I do love the taste of a good burger.", 
      "Hands down- Farren's is awesome! I always order the Steak salad and my girlfriend has the Scallop salad. Both are huge and loaded down with meat. Service can be a little hectic, but great food at good prices. \u00a0Check it out!!!", 
      "Came here on a packed Saturday night with a group of 7 people. We were seated after a good 20-minute wait. Waiters and waitresses were welcoming and accommodating, but the service, after we ordered, was slow as molasses. Granted, it's a busy weekend night, but how long does it take to get an order of burger and fries cooked? It was probably an hour between us entering the door and getting our food. However, after my green chile cheeseburger came, the wait didn't seem so bad after all. It's hands-down the best burger place in town, and I'm surprised it took me this long to find it. The meat had plenty of juiciness and flavor, and the thick, but not overpowering bun soaked up a lot of the sauce. The secret to an enjoyable burger-eating experience? A good meat-to-bun-ratio and a manageable stack. If the stack keeps falling apart, you're not going to have a good time. Farren's makes a remarkably well-balanced burger, and that in itself gets this restaurant 4 stars. But tortilla chips come standard with the burger, instead of fries? What were they thinking?Have a burger here with a smaller group of people on a less-crowded night (or for lunch). It's slightly on the pricey side but you won't be disappointed.", 
      "Hell to the mothereffin' Yes.Farren's has a delicious, mouthwatering burger that puts others to shame. \u00a0If you don't like a Farren's burger, stand up, slap yourself in the face, and try again. \u00a0It's that good. \u00a0Unless you're a vegetarian, or kosher or Hindu. \u00a0Then you can refrain from the slapping, and just glare in frustration.The beer selection is great, and if you just wanna watch a game, drink a beer, and enjoy a delicious, delicious burger, go to freakin' Farren's. \u00a0My burger of choice when i want to obliterate all healthiness is the \"Motherlode\"---mushrooms, cheese, and bleu cheese--it tastes like heart attacks and love.Farren's also shares this bizarre joint bathroom with two other great restaurants, Sushi Kame and Nitaya Thai, which makes for an amusing dining experience to say the least as you walk the labyrinthine corridors like Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom, simply looking for a place to pee.", 
      "Another reviewer says that to like this place, you have to \"get past the basement feel.\" \u00a0Good luck. \u00a0The suffix \"feel\" was a little generous, I thought.Imagine yourself fumigating in the strong smell of cooking oil, garbage, perfume, and B.O. because that's what you'll get in this poorly ventilated basement. \u00a0The decor here is what happens when you operate a business for years and stop really seeing what it looks like. \u00a0(At least that's the best excuse I can think of.) \u00a0Burnt-out lights. \u00a0Chipped paint on the walls. \u00a0A mysterious traffic light. \u00a0The furniture was ordered out of a 1970s catalog probably titled: \"Crap Tables and Chairs: Dive Bars and Outdoor Taco Stands Our Specialty.\" Combine that with hopefully-arty-but-not-really-arty framed black and white photography, deep maroon paint and bathroom-grade tile flooring. \u00a0So it's more than a basement, it's a partially destroyed bathroom in a basement that's trying too hard.Given all this, the $16 entrees on the specials menu were surprising. \u00a0One was a taco dish that appeared to be made with that pre-shredded cheese that comes in a bag and Old El Paso store-bought flour tortillas. \u00a0The catfish in the catfish sandwich special was good, but the bread was, in a word, unconscionable. \u00a0I came back after a disastrous previous visit because someone told me the specials menu had the good food on it. \u00a0Not so. \u00a0On the previous visit I had watched them make the blue cheese burger by adding a scoop from a giant plastic tub of gluey industrial blue cheese salad dressing. \u00a0The specials menu continues this high standard.To top it off, service was poor. \u00a0The food was delivered quickly but it was impossible to get a refill or the check even though the restaurant was half-empty. \u00a0Everyone seemed nice, but improbably busy with things that didn't involve customers. \u00a0The area behind the bar teemed with staff members who bustled around ignoring my waving arms.I can only attribute the positive Yelp reviews to heavy drinking. \u00a0You have been warned.", 
      "Went here with a group of friends and had a very pleasant experience. Wait staff was prompt and inviting. I had the steak and it was cooked to my specifications and the sides were very good.Will definitely come back", 
      "We heard this was the place for an outstanding burger, and we were not disappointed. \u00a0I tried \"The Motherlode\" (proper diet be damned!), which is smothered in mushrooms, swiss cheese, and bleu cheese sauce. \u00a0It was phenomenal. \u00a0While I was a little sad that I couldn't really taste the bleu cheese (surprising, considering its sharp taste), the burger itself outweighed any negatives. \u00a0It was huge and succulent, and I swear to god, they must use an actual charcoal grill. \u00a0So. Damn. Good. \u00a0Plus, it came with about a full pound of thin fries (good, but vastly improved with a few shakes of salt and/or ketchup). \u00a0I was absolutely stuffed (to the \"ow, my stomach\"-point) after leaving.The pub itself is hidden away behind Nitaya Thai and down a ramp. \u00a0It has a pleasantly dark, red and brown color scheme. \u00a0Our waiter was very nice and efficient. \u00a0Plus, they seemed to have an excellent beer list. \u00a0We all know I'm coming back. \u00a0The challenge is how to come back as often as possible without gaining 50 pounds.P.S. They had a Kobe beef burger special when I went. \u00a0I'm still kicking myself for not getting it. \u00a0Who wouldn't want a burger that comes from cows that had been massaged and subjected to classical music beforehand?", 
      "One of my favorite places in town. I often get something off their specials but I love their Mediterranean Pasta salad (add steak!), the black bean burger, and any of their regular burgers. I enjoy the tacos but prefer to get the tacos when there is a special for them. If fish and chips is on the special menu I get that. With winter comes their chili which I can never get enough of. The chips with truffle salt are very tasty as are the fries (throw on some malt vinegar). I have rarely been disappointed here and if I ever am they fix the issues. The beer selection is always superb.They are a small place but if you go after 1pm for lunch they tend to have plenty of open spots. Dinner is much harder to judge but usually a 15 minute wait is all you have to worry about.", 
      "First of all, the staff here are on their game. We went to Farren's on a Friday night for dinner, every table and bar stool were full and the line was out the door. Still, the staff (of just seven) got us seated and our meal out to us in about 20 minutes. I had a bacon burger, which was great, and my companions were happy with their choices too. They have an extensive beer and wine selection; so we will definitely be back.", 
      "Their Kobe burger with cheddar cheese, lettuce, pickles on the side, and hot fries are amazing. It satisfies the \"hard-core\" hunger..making my mouth water even now. The service is straight forward, rapid and no-questions asked cooperative.They have at least two large TV's with sports and the food network on them, it's fun to watch as you dine in. Farren's Pub is a flight of stairs down from the street level, and filled with indoor lights and good aromas. They have hot tea for the non-drinker, and it's non smoking of course. Very cool place.", 
      "Farren's has by far the best burgers in town, but that said, they can come out overcooked. Fries are tasty too, but relatively standard fare. The beer selection is usually very good, but on a few occasions they've been out of several beers listed.I finally ventured past the delicious burgers and tried the Elaine's Salad. I have to say I was disappointed. \u00a0I'm not usually one to order a salad--they seem overpriced at most restaurants. I've always attributed the high price to bigger-than-I-care-to-consume portions, but Farren's is appropriately sized, which was ok by me. The flavors, however, failed to live up to my expectations: the ranch was bland, eggs overcooked, and mixed greens heavy on the romaine. And somehow, besides a generous amount of blue cheese, it could hardly be tasted amidst the rest of the salad.I'll keep going back--but I think I'll stick to the burgers.", 
      "Before heading to Champaign for work this time I did my Yelp homework and wrote down Farren's. \u00a0When I asked co-workers if they'd been there, a couple said \"yes, great burgers'. \u00a0So seven of us gave it a try for lunch today.We split some apps - the housemade potato chips with truffled salt (if you know me, you know I have a not so secret love for all things truffled), the deep fried cauliflour and wings. \u00a0The chips were hot and the salt was flavorful (I asked for extra salt, and there were little black specks in there so I was pretty excited). \u00a0Cauliflour was a bit underfried. \u00a0Wings were OK.I had the Motherlode burger - a huge, juicy patty topped with swiss, mushrooms and a blue cheese sauce. \u00a0Very nice. \u00a0Thick burger, but not a bit dry. \u00a0Soft bun. \u00a0We all commented on the burgers (co-workers got the green chili, a bacon cheeseburger, and another one that slips my mind but smelled amazing with a pile of cooked onions on top). \u00a0Others got the seafood etouffee (meh) and a chicken sandwich with pesto sauce. \u00a0Obviously come here for the burger!!My burger came with a side of tortilla chips for around $8. \u00a0Upcharge to get fries or up-upcharge for sweet potato fries or the potato chips.Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and decisive (he told me to get the Motherlode over the green chili burger when I waffled).Basement feel, schmasement feel...it is a bar. \u00a0Cool how the bathrooms connect you to nearby thai and sushi restaurants. \u00a0And the new parking structure right next door made parking a breeze - $0.75 for the hour and free on weekends.", 
      "Update! \u00a0I've since not had a problem with the tea tasting old, and have had a couple of salads that were much better.Best burgers in town, in my opinion. They're always cooked to perfection, with an appropriately proportionate bun and delicious, thick, crunchy pickles. And, if you're pretty starved, I suggest getting fries on the side. They're toasty brown and delicious, especially when doused with malt vinegar.They also have a full bar and great apps, specials, and desserts. I sometimes just get the hummus plate app for dinner. And the fish n chips special is pretty darn good for being land locked. As for desserts, if they happen to have the chocolate chile cheesecake, DO IT.The environment is very laid back and the restaurant is fairly dim. There are a couple of TVs, but if you don't like to be distracted, you can sit away from them.Beware days of Illini games; they are packed to the gills at dinner time.", 
      "The kobe beef burger was probably the best burger I've EVER had. It was so tender and juicy. I'm not a huge burger fan, but even my dad, who could eat a burger for every meal agreed with me on this one.Really, everything I've tried there is very delicious and the food comes out fast and the service is super nice. Unlke \"Nifty C.\" I actually really liked that you can see the guys cooking in the kitchen. Yes, it's a little dim in there, but I just think the setting makes the atmosphere a bit more casual and intimate. It definitely lacks any decor and the tables and chairs are uber simple, but if you can get past that and you just want good food, this place is a great spot!"

      "SOLID burger. I got a daily special--burger topped with barbacoa, ghost pepper cheese, and cilantro ranch--and thoroughly enjoyed it. At $14, the price was perhaps a little high, but I'll definitely return. They must use a propane or gas to grill inside, though. There was a noticeable scent of gas throughout the dining room during our first and only experience here so far. Not sure if that was a one-time thing, but if it isn't they should definitely look into it.", 
      "So, went here on a busy Saturday night. \u00a0Took about 30 minutes to get a table, but that's pretty expected with a place this small and popular. \u00a0The burgers are what everybody seems to rave about, so that's what I ordered. \u00a0I ordered the \"Fire Burger\" (I think that's what it was called). \u00a0It's a decent size burger patty (probably like 1/3 lb or so) topped with roasted jalepenos, red peppers, and finished with some jalepeno/habenero cheese. \u00a0The waiter warned me that \"if you're worried about it being too spicy, it is.\" Well, it only took about 10-15 minutes for the burger to arrive, which is pretty decent considering how busy it was. I'm giving the place 2 stars for a few reasons: the \"Fire\" burger was probably around a 2 or 3 out of 10 on (my) spicy scale. \u00a0 The burger, although properly cooked and juicy (a nice medium-well), lacked seasoning and resultingly flavor. Between a lack of spiciness and lack of spices, the burger was pretty bland. \u00a0Add to that some undercooked and unseasoned fries to have a whole plate of bland. For burgers that cost around $9, I would expect a lot more. \u00a0I can't say its worth the wait and I definitely have no desire to go back.", 
      "The scallop salad is to die for. $14.95, loaded with grilled scallops, romaine, walnuts, grapes and a splendid dressing. The place was packed tonight, a Friday night, and we waited 15 minutes for a table to open up. \u00a0Huge soft drink glasses are a trademark of Farren's and of course, excellent burgers.Onion rings, tri-colored chips, fries and great salads.The 600 space parking garage right next door has changed this from a dark hideaway to a prominent location with covered parking 20 feet from their door.The restrooms can be nasty and are shared with a couple of adjoining restaurants.", 
      "Delicious burgers! Thick, meaty burgers (though you can get a blackbean burger if you're veg) served with \"tri-color tortilla chips.\" High quality beef burger, gently formed (I hate a hard/dense burger) on good buns. I always get the cheeseburger or bacon cheeseburger so I can't comment on their other more upscale dishes. I tried my husband's green chile cheesebuger- it was fine, but not as good as a traditional burger. The buffalo wings were decent, but not fantastic. They should be totally crispy and the sauce should be nothing but Frank's Red Hot, butter, and vinegar- these were just- meh. Have tried two desserts there- \u00a0a carrot cake and a lemon pie. The lemon pie was decent, the carrot cake so dense and dry it was inedible.Bottom line: Fantastic burgers. Get a burger and a beer and you won't be disappointed.", 
      "I have tried this place again and they did nothing to improve their previous review. \u00a0There is nothing special about Farren's.", 
      "Finally went here after hearing how good it was. Overall, I was pleased.I'm a firm believer that burgers can only be so good. That being said, these guys make a pretty good burger. I got a bacon burger with bleu cheese crumbles. The meat was cooked almost perfectly and I got a generous heap of cheese on top. I almost couldn't taste the bacon though...I would suggest they kick it up a notch.I found it odd that the default side is tortilla chips. They are pretty average, but do have a nice seasoning and taste good with their in-house made salsa (had to ask for it, though). It was fresh-tasting and not too spicy.Beer selection is good. They had about 5 beers on tap and a healthy list of bottles. The bottle selection was not what you typically see at a burger place, which I liked. Prices weren't too bad either.I'd come here again, for sure. If anything, I want to try that bison burger that people have been talking about. I LOVE bison burgers, but wanted to try their more traditional burger to see what all the fuss was about. It's a nice atmosphere. Everything is right there. There's no \"back\"; you can see the kitchen and where all of your food is coming from. I don't feel like I'm in some underground burger basement, but a nice, low key, bar where I could go on a date or get drinks with friends. Definitely recommend giving it a try!", 
      "The sum-up: Pub food at it's finest. \u00a0We're new to the area and have heard good things about Farren's. \u00a0My hubs and I had a free lunch w/o the kids and decided to go. \u00a0It was not hard to find and it was pleasantly crowded for lunch, which was a good sign. \u00a0We ordered sodas (bummer it was a lunch date, because we're beer drinkers) and each ordered mushroom swiss burgers, mine with blue cheese. \u00a0I also decided to splurge and get the fresh-made potato chips. \u00a0The staff was friendly and the food came out fast. \u00a0The burger was juicy and delicious and the chips...were (hold on...I'm drooling...) aaahhhh-mazing! \u00a0They were warm and the truffle salt was genius on these chips. \u00a0We will absolutely be back to Farren's and would bring the kids along. \u00a0This place is gold!", 
      "Whoa, mama, was that a delicious burger. My mouth still waters thinking about it...those jalepenos...that juicy meat...mmm... The crazy thing? I wasn't even hungry when I ate out with my friends, but I still finished everything, with the fries on the side. A bit on the pricey side, but totally worth it if you're on a casual date or your parents are celebrating your graduation. The service was prompt and friendly as well, albeit the waiter had a little bite to him. That's ok, he had spunk. Go to Farren's if you want a delicious burger done right, with personality.", 
      "A tiny little bar/restaurant in a basement basically. \u00a0It is hidden back behind Nitaya Thai restaurant and can be hard to find if you did not know what you were looking for. \u00a0A bar runs a long the back, with tables scattered. \u00a0Very limited seating, so expect to wait if you get here at peak hours. \u00a0Very cozy. \u00a0The service is usually pretty good. \u00a0They do the best they can when the place is slammed.Six quality beers on tap, much more in bottles. \u00a0So they got the good beer covered. \u00a0Full bar as well. \u00a0The food is great. \u00a0Some of the best pub grub in town. \u00a0Of coarse the burgers are what they are known for. \u00a0Which are great. \u00a0The salads are also really good. \u00a0A great place to come for a beer and a meal.",

      "So tasty! I had heard that they had the best burgers in town, so I went, me and my friends all got different burgers, and they did not disappoint. Fries are pretty standard, but burgers are fantastic.", 
      "This place is a hidden gem. \u00a0Thanks to Yelp, I found it! \u00a0Nice little bar type atmosphere with seating. \u00a0Open kitchen, so you ca watch them cook your burger!I would definitely recommend the \"special\" burger of the day. \u00a0Ours was Elk, and it was fantastic! \u00a0Also, many great beers on tap.", 
      "Me too, me too, me too on all the good things others say about this place and not me, not me, not me on all the negative things in other reviews.We attended the film festival at the Virginia Theatre a block away and wanted to find good food near the festival and we got it right! We ate there three days in a row and my wife and I have only good things to say about the experience.About the food -- the burgers are as good as any I have had. The one that comes with the blue cheese sauce is not to be missed - and do order one extra shot of the sauce. We just took the tortilla chips that come with the burgers (I did not want the calories that come with French fries). Bad choice. Next time I will take the calories and the fries. I also had the fish tacos (they actually \u00a0were called by the name of the fish which I forgot). They were great. Good quantity and quality. Served, as I recall, with a very tasty salad. The third item I had was a chicken curry on top of a bed of greens. Again, very good quantity and very tasty.About the Service - It was lunch time. The place gets very busy. The staff hustles. They run thru the maze of tables. They get everything right and maintain a cool composure. They are friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. When I needed something I stood up, waved my arms, got the attention of someone (not our server) asked for what I needed and it got there FAST.I don't give many five star reviews, but this place deserves it.", 
      "Farrens may not have the fanciest atmosphere, but the burgers are great! In particular, \u00a0their burger specials (kobo beef or bison burger) are great! The fries are made from real potatoes, the service is very kind. I usually hardly ever finish a whole dish at farrens, it's abundant and really tasty. You can tell that they use high quality ingredients.", 
      "Great food. Cool atmosphere. Service was slow. Maybe caught them on an off-night, but we still felt ignored at our table.", 
      "I like Farren's pretty well for a happy hour type dinner. \u00a0The grilled steak salad and sweet potato fries are my favorites. \u00a0I've had super super annoying service more than once (not BAD as much as way too interested in starting a conversation and becoming friends with the diners), and every single time my friend has ever asked the kitchen to hold the french fries he has gotten an extra huge heaping load of french fries.", 
      "I waited a year and a half to go to Farrens, which was a huge mistake. The burgers are great, and probably the best ones in the CU area (though I still have lots to try). But what really sets the place head and shoulders above everyone are the potato chips with truffle salt. That stuff is fantastic, and totally worth every extra penny.Beer selection is okay, and they rotate stuff throughout the year. Staff is also very nice. Farrens only gets four stars because the bar selection isn't the best and because the decor feels a bit run-down. Still an excellent place to go.", 
      "I'm in the middle of another one of these week-long jaunts through the midwest and found myself in Champaign and needing lunch. \u00a0I've sampled some pretty caloric fare over the last few days, so thought I'd try something a bit lighter today for lunch. \u00a0Stopped in to this place and saw that they had a strawberry salad with chicken and a raspberry vinaigrette and got that with spinach subbed for the mixed greens.Service was friendly and astonishingly quick. \u00a0Salad came back in probably under 3 minutes from the time I ordered it. \u00a0So that was good. \u00a0And the salad TASTED great. So why am I giving this place three stars? \u00a0Well, first, in order to get 5 stars you have to be really exemplary. \u00a0This place was very good in a lot of ways and would probably get a 4* rating from me except.... they REALLY need to work on their presentation. \u00a0The salad shows up and it has a lot of great things going for it... spinach, strawberries, walnuts, grapes.... and then they had this huge pasty white chicken breast thrown on top in a single form and they had the garishly pink vinaigrette just poured right on top. \u00a0The salad LOOKED horrible. \u00a0I'm not sure how they cooked the chicken, but based on the way it looked, it could have been boiled because it was just this pasty, gelatinous pale breast that was completely unappetizing. And the pink dressing on top of it didn't help.I strongly considered eating around the chicken, but brought myself to taste it and it was actually really good. \u00a0I just don't know how they cooked it to make it look so horrible. \u00a0So my suggestions for this restaurant when serving a salad that includes chicken: Throw it on the grill for a few seconds to give it some grill marks or do SOMETHING to give it some color. \u00a0And then toss the salad to mix in that pink dressing.So good food, good service, but presentation of my dish kept this place from getting 4*", 
      "Farren's is one of my favorite restaurants in town. It's the kind of place you begin to frequent so much, the waiters remember your exact order. I have switched it up on occasion, and every single thing I have tried was awesome. My favorites are the tacos (chicken or black bean burger that come with sour cream and great salsa) and the chicken Caesar salad (homemade croutons, and the dressing is better than any Caesar dressing I've ever had); my husband always gets either the green chile cheese burger or the Kobe burger. The hamburgers here are very thick, so make sure you're hungry! You simply cannot go wrong with anything on the menu--it's that good. The ambience is one of my favorite things about the place; Farren's is located under ground and has a bar, enough room for large groups of friends, and doesn't feel stuffy. In the winter it can get cold in there, so make sure you bundle up.", 
      "Their food is awesome! \u00a0I've had an assortment of their appetizers, including their truffle chips, and they were all delicious. \u00a0On three other occasions I have had a burger, the fish tacos and a salad. \u00a0The burger is probably one of the best in town, the fish tacos were awesome, if a little on the pricey side, and the salad (can't remember the name but it had chicken, strawberries and I believe some kind of creamy-ish strawberry vinigrette?) was one of the top three salads I have probably ever eaten in my life (maybe even top 2.) \u00a0They have a stellar beer selection and you can see their kitchen clearly from the dining room. \u00a0That earns respect from me on two levels - 1. It is a ridiculously tiny kitchen to put out such good food so quickly and 2. YOU CAN SEE INTO THE KITCHEN! which means I can see that it is clean, that the people cooking aren't dripping sweat and boogies into my food and there are no small critters wandering around. \u00a0I have a great deal of respect for restaurants that are confident enough to allow diners a view of behind the scenes processes! \u00a0Oh yeah, the guy that we usually get as our server is super nice, as are the rest of the staff. \u00a0And they are very knowledgeable about their food and their beer, etc...Only complaints are: it is kind of a tiny place and some nights it fills up pretty quick so you have to wait in line watching everyone else drink beer and have a good time. \u00a0(Or just sit at the bar, which is fine too) \u00a0Also, \u00a0I completely agree with Teej on the Indiana Jones bathroom experience...ladies, when it's cold out, I would recommend avoiding the bathroom because it feels like it is outdoors and I thought I would freeze to the seat.It's probably been really good for their business having that parking garage right next door. \u00a0And I know it looks like kind of a dingy little hole-in-the-wall because it is situated right next to \"creepy back alley,\" but don't let that fool you. \u00a0I missed out on this place for a few years just because I never noticed it and I perceived it as said hole-in-wall.Happy booze and burger-ing! \u00a0Cheers", 
      "Be cautious of the red hair waitress!!!!! Have to say firstly, when we went there today like 11:30 am, there were nobody inside the store at all. I know it is a pub-ish place, but I brought my 1 year old daughter simply because I heard their burger could be impressive. Turned out, not at all, just normal burger with an overcharged price, that is all. And what came next is what made me determined not to visit any again. My daughter needed to get her diaper changed before we leave, and the RED HAIR WAITRESS immediately showed indifferent look on her face and impatiently assign us to their shared toilet where no place can be used to change diaper if you don't count the dirty mosaic floor. I am pretty sure if they can, they will cancel the in-store highchairs and post a \"no kid allowed\" sign. In conclusion, Mediocre FOOD and WORST SERVICE in Campaign area.", 
      "Very juicy burgers! Probably one of the best burger joints in the Champaign-Urbana area. Chill atmosphere, the decor was better than I expected after reading some others' reviews. It's good for family, friends gatherings and also to grab a beer and watch sports games.", 
      "The burgers are great - really big and juicy. They come with tortilla chips or you can pay extra for fries... I found the fries to be pretty bad though. Too skinny and not crispy so I was a little disappointed there weren't any good fries to complement the burger! But that's okay, the burger is really really yummy. I tried my friends' chips and they tasted a tiny bit stale but maybe that's the way they're supposed to be...?I've also ordered takeout from here by calling ahead, the food was ready in just 10 minutes. Awesome!", 
      "Great burgers but I go for the chicken tacos for lunch.I've been going here for years, haven't had a bad meal and/or experience here yet.", 
      "This is a great hole in the wall place. \u00a0It isn't the easiest to find if you haven't already been there.They have a lot of good food and the service is very courteous.I have been here several times and only had problems once (it was just waiting a while to get the check) which can happen when it gets busy.", 
      "This has been a staple in our family's lives for the last 5 years, birthday parties, holiday parties, business meetings and countless family get togethers. \u00a0Caroline and her staff are the best! \u00a0I have never felt more comfortable and welcome in any restaurant! \u00a0The food is consistently amazing and the specials are always outstanding. \u00a0Fine food, great pub environment-family favorites include, hummus plate, wings, burgers (include specialty burgers) \u00a0chips and fish tacos and of course ice cold Krushevich on tap!!!!", 
      "I've been to Farren's twice - once in my freshman year, and again in my final year at the U of I. \u00a0I'm very sad that I haven't been more. \u00a0Farren's is a hidden gem with friendly staff, a lively atmosphere, and probably the best burgers in Champaign-Urbana. \u00a0I've got a weak spot for places that serve great food WITHOUT an attitude.", 
      "Love this place. \u00a0Staff is great. \u00a0Food is great. \u00a0Place is great. \u00a0I normally get the black bean tacos and love them", 
      "I have ventured off of campus to Farren's 3 or 4 times and each one has been a great experience. As many have said, the burgers are all very good though a little expensive for a student's budget. For the student crowd, I would definitely stay away from the Kobe Burger as the extra cost isn't justified by any increase in flavor. The Buffalo Burger is one of the best burgers you can find in C-U and is definitely worth a try.Outside of the Burgers, Farren's has many unexpected dishes which are all delicious. I have tasted both the scallops and toasted ravioli, both of which I was leery of at first, but each of the dishes proved to be delicious. Don't be misled by the word \"pub\" in the name of the restaurant, everything on the menu is a specialty.The place is small so the service is always quick and the atmosphere is always very casual and friendly. All considered, a burger (or scallops) with a bottle of your favorite at Farren's is one of the best lunch picks in downtown Champaign.", 
      "Wow, the best food in downtown Champaign!try the blackened chicken tacos, they are off the menu, but the best !This place is a constant good treat, a little pricey, but worth the cash!", 
      "I think one sentence sums this place up perfectly... \"Greasiest Food you Will Ever Eat.\"There's a lot of hype and praise about this place, but I really can't dig it just because all the food comes out dripping in grease. \u00a0It's a burger and fries type of place to begin with, but even the soups come out with heavily oiled broth and salads loaded with Oily salad dressing (definitely ask for it on the side so you can spare yourself the grease attack)My co-workers love this place so I go every now and then, but of all the different dishes I've ordered, they were all dripping buckets of grease. \u00a0Sure it's tasty, and I will always dig some greasy food, but this is really too much... Way too much. \u00a0Burgers, fries, salmon burgers, steaks, chicken sandwiches, salad, etc. \u00a0it's all pouring oil out the wazoo. \u00a0I got to say the service is exceptional though. \u00a0Every time I've went the service was very friendly, quick, and our food always came out fast. \u00a0Prices are reasonable too. \u00a0As for the atmosphere, I can see some people digging it but it's quite \"unique\" to say the least. \u00a0You really would never even be able to guess this was a restaurant looking at it from the outside. \u00a0There's a sign on the main road for it, but then you got to walk into the block a little bit and its in a plain colored building, hid away in a little nook. \u00a0It only gets more \"interesting\" as you go in and descend into the restaurant. \u00a0Yes, it's in a sort of a basement almost. \u00a0I'm not against the place by any means, and the food is OK and the service is great. \u00a0It's just far too greasy for me. \u00a0It's just a place for those that don't mind really really greasy food.", 
      "AMAZING BURGER!!! BEST IN CHAMPAIGN/URBANA!! The only complaint I could have is the slightly oblivious servers. We had the same server both times, rarely received refills and waited a long time for our check. It seems that ever when other servers walked by a noticed our empty glasses .. they didn't bother to assist! But when in good company of friends .. I could care less about my glass and an amazing burger!", 
      "I enjoyed their veggie burger. It came with a cajun remoulade - yum! The fries were just all right (part of my reason for the 4 stars). They had a decent selection of drinks (wine, beers, spirits). The location is a bit strange - sort of in a back alley. I almost missed it! But The prices were fine and the ambience was just what I expected for a Champaign Pub. It was a bit chilly inside, but then again it was 20 degrees out that night.", 
      "BEST BURGERS IN C-U. I've tried a couple specials and they were good, but nothing compares to the burgers. They also have an amazing molten chocolatey dessert. And, I've always had excellent service. My only complaint is that they serve tortilla chips with their burgers; it just seems odd.", 
      "This is the 2nd time to this place in about 2 years time. The siblings and I came here to visit after they arrived in town. I didn't eat anything tonight as I'd eaten earlier. They all had fabulous food. I shot photos of most all the food. There was two salads a black bean veggie burger and a mother load burger. There was fresh cut fries and chips. Everybody loved the food, the atmosphere, and drinks.Great time.", 
      "The burgers are indeed quite good! \u00a0We had a green chile cheese burger and a mushroom Swiss cheese burger. \u00a0 The Saturday night wait is a little tough, but 20 minutes later, we were seated. \u00a0Lots to choose from on the menu.. burgers, sandwiches, salads. Most importantly, the fries are excellent, and the onion rings are very good \u00a0the coating is light and stays with the onion ring when you bite into it!", 
      "occupying a small-ish basement location on Randolph St in downtown Champaign, Farren's has been my go-to place for salads for years and years. \u00a0they make their own salad dressings (both the strawberry vinaigrette and ranch are delish) and use excellent greens and toppings. \u00a0the everything-topped crackers that accompany the salads are light, and a real treat. \u00a0and their prices have stayed the same for years now (unreal, no?), which translates into a good deal in 2008. \u00a0yes, they have good burgers and a mean veggie burger. \u00a0yes, they have creative specials using super-high-quality ingredients at prices more reasonable than all those other downtown joints. \u00a0yes, they were the original killer-beer-selection place before there was a Blind Pig. \u00a0and yes, the manager Todd is fantastic and the service is fast and friendly (don't sit at the bar unless you're up for a chat). \u00a0but mostly, just go to Farren's for the salads!!!", 
      "Thank you, Carolyn F., for setting the record straight -- I stand corrected. \u00a0My friend is coming back to town in a couple of weeks and I promise we will stop in again for another try of your fries. \u00a0Just don't get me addicted to them like I have Jarling's Custard....whoo boy ;)", 
      "I think it goes without saying that this is my opinion but a burger from Farren's is the best burger available in CU, no contest. \u00a0Fries are nothing special \u00a0but if yr looking for tasty fries you prolly know where to go (Courier, Esquire, Wonderdogs). \u00a0I stick with the chips that come with the burger.Friendly staff - sorry to hear the other young lady found it to be too friendly, but I would suggest it's better than the alternative. \u00a0I guarantee that it's meant to make sure you are happy with your meal - more like \"when yr here, yr family\" than olive garden could ever be.The best burger around, period. \u00a0Nice selection of good salads too.", 
      "Best burger in town!!! \u00a0It is very casual and they have a nice menu selection, though I almost always get a burger. If you are looking for a place to chill out with a good brew and burger, this is a nice option. Prices are not too expensive, though a bit higher than Campus Town. Recommended!"

      "Hands down, the best burger in the area. Large, hand-pattied, and well-seasoned! Tastes like a homemade grilled burger without all of the fuss. The accompaniments are fresh, and while some may find it odd that you need to request tomatoes or pickles I like that they don't get wasted if you are a plain jane burger eater like myself. Definitely pay the extra cash to switch from tortilla chips as your side to french fries. These are the skin on fries that you can douse with malt vinegar if the mood strikes. The feel of the restaurant is cozy, the beer prices are good. The service is very friendly and everyone seems happy to be there. This is definitely a regular in my restaurant rotation!", 
      "Two words: Bison burger.", 
      "The burger was really good. The service wasn't good.", 
      "Before I even ordered my food, I knew I would love it when The Cooking Channel was on one of the TV's at the bar. The green chile burger was quite delicious and went down nicely with a really tastey bottled rootbeer. My husband ordered The Russell, which I liked even more. I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner, but don't expect a table at peak hours right away ...it's quite popular! The service was excellent, no fuss or finesse, and fast. There were no weird basement smells, nor did I feel like I was in a basement. It feels like a pub and burger place.", 
      "I don't let myself go to Farren's often.Here's an example of my average inner monologue during a Farren's visit. It might help shed some illumination as to why:\"Farren's! Yay! Oooh, beer list. Oooh, beer I've never had! Order beer.\"*beer consumed*\"Ooh, menu! WHAT? HOUSEMADE CHIPS? WITH TRUFFLE SALT? Hey! Fried portabello - Battered, deep-fried and served with ranch??! YAY APPETIZERS! I should have another beer...\"*beer consumed*\"BURGERS! With BACON! And BLEU CHEESE! And MUSHROOMS! YAAAY!\"Basically, I'm internally like a candy-fueled ten-year old on Christmas morning, only instead of toys I'm really 25, slightly drunk, and ordering menu items with no abandon. Farren's is awesome. The prices are high-ish, and for a reason - the food is damn good. It's a burger place, but they make an effort to dress the food up a bit. The service has always been friendly and prompt. The problem I have with Farren's is not with their establishment, but for the shame and self-loathing I encounter after ordering two appetizers, a huge burger, and two or three beers, and consuming all of it, like a black hole for food and drinks. And the immense discomfort of feeling like I could possibly literally explode. And then the resonant shame I feel when I get my Discover bill and I think, \"Hey, did I take a whole group of people to dinner? How did I spend $40 at Farren's? I thought we split checks that night... oh... we did.\"tl;dr version: Farren's is amazing, there are wonderful things with truffle salt, also maybe fried, but it is a little pricey and not diet food. I recommend only going once every few months, unless you like the feel of a nice elastic waistband in your pants.", 
      "Wow, never thought I'd think a burger is BLAND but there you have it. Zero seasoning and they overcooked both me and my wife's burger.", 
      "Hands down the best burgers in Champaign-Urbana. They also have an excellent beer selection that varies from visit to visit. I no longer live in C-U, but when I lived there I was a regular at Farren's, and when back in town visiting recently, I made sure to stop in and eat at Farren's again. The burgers were just as good as I remembered.I'm somewhat of a \"Burger Snob\" (if such a thing really exists) and have tried most of the popular burger places in Chicago, and I'd say Farren's ranks right up there with all of them.", 
      "Let me start by saying that if you have not been here, and are going for the first time, get past the basment feel. \u00a0The food is SOOO good. \u00a0They have some typical bar-ish stuff, like the best burgers in town, and fried cauliflower, which I need to stop ordering.But it is more then a pub. \u00a0Kobe Burgers! \u00a0Chicken and veal sausage specials! \u00a0Diver scallops some times! \u00a0Interesting and changing wine selections. \u00a0I hate beer, but I hear they have a great selection. \u00a0I also really like the service. \u00a0They are accommodating, and you will wait for nothing. \u00a0That said, this is the snarkiest group of people I have ever seen, but in a VERY good way. \u00a0The leaving with a laugh way. \u00a0I have never been one to not go out and eat alone if I feel like eating out alone. \u00a0This is my favorite. \u00a0If you bring a book, you wont end up reading a lot because you will end up laughing with your server / bar tender which will lead you in to a conversation with the people next to you, and you will enjoy it.Go there now and have a good burger. \u00a0NOW!!!", 
      "I lived here for two years before I noticed this place - it really is hard to find from the street, even though it's in downtown Champaign. Never had a bad meal since then, though. Great juicy burgers, and their strawberry and walnut salad is one of my favorite summertime meals. I always feel bad for the cooks in their little tiny kitchen tucked into a corner of the dining room, but they send simple, honest, tasty food out of it.", 
      "I really don't get what the big deal is with this place. \u00a0I have had friends tell me thats they have some of the best burgers out there, but when i went there they were nothing special. \u00a0The place as a whole is just average: the setting, the service and the food. \u00a0This place is over rated.", 
      "Farren's took a couple of times for me to warm up to. \u00a0Hidden by a parking garage, it's a bit lacking in curb appeal, but their burgers are GREAT. \u00a0If I'm not grilling, this is where I will have a burger. \u00a0And their tuna tacos -- yum . . . . the special is totally worth your money, it's a huge meal! The beers are usually around $5 for drafts, not cheap but in line with other Downtown restaurants. Don't bother with the tortilla chips, they're almost always stale. Get the fries. You know \u00a0you want them anyway. The tables are crappy, the ambiance not so chic. \u00a0But they make a fiiiine \u00a0burger.", 
      "To be honest, I was a little disappointed. I just got a basic burger (the first one on their menu with a fancy name). The food was average, neither great nor bad, but I guess I just had a higher expectation from a yelp-4-star place. The ambient was a little better for a place that's very hidden by the alley. I would rather go to Desthil next time where they have better drinks and the same quality food in the same price range.", 
      "Wildly overrated. \u00a0Everybody says that it has the best burgers in town, and the place suffers a little from excessively high expectations. I've only had the burgers, so I can't speak to anything else. \u00a0In brief, the burgers are bland, just plain patted beef patties on a griddle. There is nothing exceptional in the seasoning, preparation, quality of beef, toppings, etc. It's nothing special, neither good nor bad. \u00a0The dingy atmosphere (a staid lunch counter in a basement that had leaking ceilings both times I went) might be considered cool in a kitschy or hipster way, but I found it unappealing. \u00a0If you want the crappy ambience to be a selling point, then the food has to be good. \u00a0I tried it twice, it underwhelmed on both occasions. \u00a0Maybe I'm missing something...", 
      "Farren's Pub & Eatery is has a casual type of atmosphere. It's a great place to go with your friends to enjoy good American style food and drinks. Their burgers here are so delicious and juicy! I'm almost getting hungry right now just thinking about it.", 
      "Great burgers!!! I went there was some friends and was very surprised at how good the food was. I love the atmosphere because it is definitely a place that has a pub setting. Definitely a place to try and go again and again!", 
      "Pretty darn good. Make sure that you are willing to pay more for better food when you stop by, b/c this is definitely a step above pub grub. They use interesting local ingredients (lemon chive potato salad was awesome). Their beer menu is not as vast as some nearby joints, but they have a few shining stars. Right now they have a special on Krusovice, a great Czech pilsner. Service is fast and friendly at the bar. On the not-so-good side, when I visited a while ago, their selection for vegetarians was notably lacking. This has improved somewhat.",

      "Kobe burgers, truffle french fries, glasses of soda (or pop, whatever) the size of your head. \u00a0I love Farren's so much, but I often forget about it due to it's out of the way location. \u00a0However, anytime I feel even remotely like celebrating something, it's always Farren's I go to. \u00a0Also, sometimes I crave their house dressing in an unhealthy way. \u00a0 Only downsides is that the place is small and can get really busy on weeknights or game days. \u00a0When it gets busy, service can sometimes slow down.", 
      "All i have to say is, the most amazing burgers ive had in my life. After reading all the yelp reviews i just had to see what the hype is all about! Great beer selection also; esp being a girly girl and not liking beer..they had a variety of light and fruity ones. It's in a basement but you cant even tell; doesnt have a dungy smell or look to it. Def a hole in the wall worth going to!!!", 
      "very chill place to grab a burger and drinks with friends.The burgers are probably the best in the CU area and it's cheap. they have specials but they ran out of the fish and chipsI got the Fire burger and my friend got the Russell which were recommended by the waitor. the fire burger was very spicy which is good! the fries were amazing! the kind that's almost brown with a bit of skin on it. also got a beer there (O'fallen) it's a bottle but it was really sweet which is what I asked for.", 
      "We love Farren's for it's off-the-beaten-path location and unexpectedly good food. You could say we're regulars. Enjoyed the chipotle shrimp taco special recently, but usually have one of their terrific burgers. My wife always gets the strawberry and walnut salad. It's delicious. Fortunately for me, she can never finish it. They have a good selection of beers and the service is always speedy and friendly.", 
      "Though a bit off the beaten path, I was thoroughly impressed with Farren's:1) The food was absolutely delicious.2) The service was excellent, I never had to wonder where they were and the food arrived promptly.3) Kobe beef burger? YES!", 
      "The burgers and salads are wonderful. Definitely the best fries in town, and you can even order sweet potato fries. Great service, and cozy atmosphere.", 
      "I absolutely love Farren's! I always order the steak salad...every time! I have had many steak salad's at various different restaurants not only in Champaign, but all over the U.S. and nothing even comes close in comparison! This is one great steak salad! I could eat one every day if I could afford it. The service is always fast as well...even during their busy lunch rush! It's a bit on the pricey side, but well worth it! \u00a0The salad is loaded down with steak. \u00a0Sirloin, I think. \u00a0Grilled onions and mushroom, drizzled with a heafty ranch dressing. \u00a0Not watered down like some places. \u00a0Finally, it's topped with big chunks of blue cheese! \u00a0AWESOME!", 
      "These burgers are ridiculous. One of my boys hit me up and was like we need to go to Farren's. One of the best burgers I've ever had in my life and easily the best burger in the Champaign area. No one else comes close.", 
      "\"Farren's has the best burgers in town.\"", 
      "This is my favorite restaurant in Champaign! \u00a0I always get a bacon burger and it is amazing. \u00a0I have never had a burger under or over cooked. \u00a0The fries are always good. \u00a0I also love their beer menu. \u00a0I swear, nothing goes better with a bacon burger than a Scotty Karate Scotch Ale! \u00a0I have brought friends, family and girlfriend, with no complaints! \u00a0Parking is not an problem with the parking deck right next door.", 
      "Very good beef and salmon burgers. \u00a0Fresh food, good service. \u00a0Not loaded with smelly college kids either! \u00a0A great find. \u00a0My daughter loved her caesar salad too so we were 4 for 4 across the table in truly liking our meals. \u00a0Fresh brewed iced tea always nice.", 
      "I love going to Farren's for lunch. \u00a0I had somehow managed to forget about the place for a while, and when I went back it was better than I remembered. \u00a0I usually get the Steak Salad, which is excellent.I'm writing this review specifically to point something else out, though: Farren's is an absolutely wonderful place to bring my 17-month-old daughter. \u00a0The waitress with the curly red hair (whose name I don't know, unfortunately) offered us fruit and oyster crackers for her as soon as we sat down. \u00a0Later, since there isn't a traditional \"kid's menu,\" she offered to make a cheese quesadilla, which I took her up on. \u00a0It might seem funny to take a kid to a bar, but it works out great for us. \u00a0We can have high-quality adult food and she is accommodated as well as (or, in my opinion better than) in any \"kid-friendly\" chain restaurant.", 
      "I liked this place. \u00a0Yes it is hidden awa...but that just adds to the charm of the place. \u00a0It's nothing fancy, just a nice burger joint. \u00a0The burger was good...was it the best I have ever eaten...not really...but they are good. \u00a0I loved the fries. \u00a0My daughter had the black bean burger (she's vegetarian) she said it was very good. All in all a very tasty meal.", 
      "Ate here early sep-12. Hadn't been in over a year. Why did I wait so long? Got the russell burger and it was delish. Got chips and salsa instead of fries. Very grateful to be able to do something other than fries. Our waitress was great and we were served by who I'm guessing is the owner (Mr Faren?). You can tell they are committed to having the best burgers in town.", 
      "Best burgers I have ever had, probably. \u00a0Or at least the burgers that all other places are judged by. \u00a0The Russell is amazing...", 
      "Hidden gem of C-U. Free parking in parking garage next door.Burgers, Beer, Fries. Top 5 burgers.", 
      "Great place for burgers, salads, casual dining. \u00a0Service has always been friendly and efficient. \u00a0Long beer list, though no Heineken. \u00a0Parking in massive city garage right next door. \u00a0Usually busy, though I've never waited long.", 
      "This is the epitome of a hole in the wall restaurant with great food. My mom and I would come to this place at least once a week and every time, I was never disappointed. My go-to is the kobe burger with a side of blue cheese dressing for the fries. My mom doesn't eat red meat, so there were plenty of excellent options for her. Occasionally we would try items off of their specials and they, too, were amazing. The service is great, always friendly and very efficient. Farrens, to say the least, has become a home-away-from-home. Oh, and their beer options!-so good :) Anytime someone is looking for a great burger, I direct them here. Anytime someone is looking for a good beer, I direct them here. Anytime someone is looking for good food in general, you guessed right....I direct them here. This is the perfect place if you're with a group that have an eclectic taste. HOWEVER, expect to wait if you come with a big group on a friday or saturday night but you shouldn't wait too long. This is definitely a Champaign must!", 
      "I came here for my birthday in November. We came around dinner time but more towards the end, so they were able to seat my group of 7 people as soon as we got in. The waiter was super nice. Since it was my birthday, he ended up not charging me for my meal, which was kind of him. \u00a0I ordered the Russell burger, which has mushrooms, bacon, jalape\u00f1o cheese and blue cheese sauce--amazing! It was juicy and huge, and extremely tasty. We also had dessert. I enjoyed both desserts, but I enjoyed the chocolate dessert even more. Just a little forewarning, the chocolate dessert is really really sweet. High risk for getting chocolate wasted! :-)", 
      "Looking for great ambience? \u00a0Look elsewhere. \u00a0This might well fit into the category of \"dives\" on the Food Networks \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives,\" and I say that with the utmost affection. \u00a0Nor can I vouch for much of the food on the menu, as I pretty much stick to the burgers. \u00a0Give me a Russell or a Motherlode with fries. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0There is often the option of Texas Kobe beef or bison for the burger. \u00a0Both great. \u00a0Onion rings quite good, too. \u00a0(You can see the kind of diet I'm on when I come here.) \u00a0Decent beer selection. \u00a0In all my visits, I have never had any problems with service or the quality of food. \u00a0The staff has been friendly. \u00a0I did promise one of the waitresses that I'd make her a Bourbon Pecan Pie but haven't fulfilled that promise yet. \u00a0Perhaps next visit. \u00a0Anyway, in my often not so humble opinion (after all, I'm The Godfather), this is the best place for burgers in C-U.", 
      "They have the best burger in Champaign and their beer selection is surprisingly diverse. Order a bit rarer than you normally would as they seem to be a bit conservative in their definition of medium. Also their specialty fries are really good with a bit of malt vinegar so spring for them over the included tortilla chips. Be ready to wait for a table cause this place was crowded when I went on a Friday night."

      "A friend introduced me to Seven Saints and I've come back a few times. It has a nice selection of beer, but not the best in town. \u00a0What draws me back are the sliders, the 7 Saints Salad and the waffle fries. My first time here I had the 7 Sinners Crowd Pleaser and it was just as sinfully good as described. Especially the beer battered cheese curds that you've read many reviews praising. However, I cannot incorporate it in every meal as it is rather lot of food.So my usual go to is the 7 saints salad which has a lemony-peanut dressing that I just cannot forget. It is especially good during lunch when they serve it half size. \u00a0I feel really good about myself after eating it, because I get my veggies and protein (yummy sirloin). \u00a0I would generally split this with someone and add a few sliders. You can always substitute the beef patty with chicken or turkey (or boca). The California is one that I enjoy. Personally don't like the Chicago Dog, which should remain a dog. Lastly I finish with the waffle fries! Oh just delicious. Well seasoned!", 
      "Cheese Curd Heaven at \"Gourmet White Castle!\"Slide on over to Seven Saints, a trendy, burger bar specializing in sliders in Champaign, IL. It offers house-made, hand-pattied beef sliders with a variety of gemlicious topping combos and complimentary lettuce, tomatoes, pickles & onions upon request. If beef isn't your baby, don't fret, there are plenty of other protein options or try em all: hand-made, seasoned turkey patty, salmon, bratwurst, hotdog, blt, grilled chicken, fried chicken patty, and boca burgers are also available as slider options.\u00a0Also, Seven Saints has a gemload of yummy salads, sides and apps. You can order things a la carte, or they offer mix & match combo platters (e.g.\u00a0choose a slider, 1/2 salad & a side, the \"Triple S Combo\" for $9.79 or choose a slider & a 1/2 salad for $7.99, etc.). I got the original turkey slider with lettuce, tomato & pickle & a 1/2 order of the Greek salad. As an app, I ordered the cheese curds, and on a subsequent visit I got a side order of sweet potato fries.\u00a0For starters, the cheese curds here are the best ones I've ever had! They are made in-house, lightly beer-battered & are like giant marshmallows stuffed with gooey, white cheddar cheese. They will cost you $8.49 out of pocket & set you back about 2 weeks worth of calories & cholesterol, but they alone are worth the road trip to Champaign!My turkey burger slider was a little larger than a silver dollar. It was nothing extraordinary but was fresh, not greasy & pretty tasty, a solid 4 stars. The mini bun was nice & soft too.\u00a0I also got the half order of the Greek salad which is field greens tossed in a traditional Greek vinaigrette with cucumbers, kalmata olives, red onions, pepperoncinis, fire-roasted artichokes & is topped with feta cheese. It was really flavorful, fresh & tasty, and I would re-order it!\u00a0I don't order sweet potato fries that often but ordered them here because they were crinkle-cut which I rarely see. I'm glad I did because they were some of the best SPF I've ever had. At some places, the customary straight ones are either limp/soggy with no crispiness or overly sweet with some unwelcome/unwanted surprise, sugary-coating basted all over them. These guys were soft on the inside with a perfect, crispiness on the outside (kind of like White Castle's regular fries), and they weren't doused in any surprise, sugary-coating. They had a nice, natural sweet potato taste, 5 gems for taste & texture!\u00a0Last thing, this bar is well-stocked for the most part. It has a gemload of liquor & craft beers. I tried Rain Organic Vodka on the rocks with regular olives for the first time. I didn't really care for it because it's a lil harsh with a sweet after taste. If I ever come back, I will just stick to Chopin Vodka, since they didn't\u00a0have Ciroc Vodka, my fave (boo).\u00a0All in all, my experience at Seven Saints was pretty heavenly. The service here is decent but needs a slight tune up. The bartenders were friendly but service was a lil slow & scattered for my taste (however not Denny's-Champaign, IL slow, thank heavens!), almost a 4 though. The cheese curds & sweet potato fries were the saints of the show, and I do like all of the various slider & salad options on the menu. (Think gourmet White Castle with salads & booze too!)It's dark & nice inside, and they are striving for a Wicker Park-like, Chicago bar feel. So if you ever find yourself in Champaign, IL, I recommend dining & drinking at this gemlicious, slider-burger bar as it was one of my fave places I visited in Champaign, a solid, high 4 gems!", 
      "I came here for dinner with a friend who is currently in grad school at U of I and with another friend just passing through Chambana for few hours. \u00a0In short, we just needed a place to catch up and Seven Saints provided that and more! On a Sunday evening, we were seated outside immediately and our waiter was accommodating and attentive without hovering. \u00a0We each ended up going with the slider and salad combo with sweet potato fries on the side. \u00a0I chose the salmon slider (complete with cucumber and dill sauce) and the salmon salad (a more Mexican take with a southwest ranch dressing) & I was extremely content with my choices; even having some leftovers for lunch the next day! In my opinion, the portions were definitely very reasonable. \u00a0The sliders were about the size of the diameter of a standard water or beer glass or at least that is what our waiter told us! Seven Saints ended up being the perfect spot to catch up with old friends over some delicious food; I'd definitely recommend this joint to anyone with a rumbling tummy in downtown Chambana!", 
      "Meh. Looking for fried food? \u00a0Go here. Get the pretzel, its good. \u00a0The drinks are okay. The salmon dill slider? \u00a0I ate the salmon and left the rest. Classic is on point though. \u00a0Staff was attentive which is refreshing. What can I say I like when people treat me well.", 
      "I remember the first time I was introduced to Tri Tip sirloin... \u00a0It had been a long day surfing when we stumbled upon a beach party in San Diego where some fellow beach bums were grilling some meat low and slow, it was perfectly peppery and delicious. \u00a0Next time I had it was in the Signature Salad at Seven Saints. \u00a0I had thought for some time that this was the best salad I had ever tasted, until I tried the Summer Salmon salad also from Seven Saints and now I stand at ends forever confused about which I like better.", 
      "Love the sliders 7 saints salad is to die for. Nice atmosphere and outside sidewalk seating when weather is warmer. Best food in a bar in town.", 
      "While traveling I often eat at pubs and Seven Saints is on the high end of the list for good pub grub. I was told they were famous for their sliders, so I chose the Chicago Dog slider, mainly because I love Chicago Dogs and also because it was out of the ordinary. The slider was very good, but a little overpriced. Not wanting to fill up on just sliders, I also got the Chipotle salad which was very well done and was tasty and surprisingly filling for a salad. I enjoyed the atmosphere- relaxed with good music playing. The waiter was friendly, but not very attentive, especially considering it was not that busy. I had to ask several times just to get a refill on my water. I often judge a place by asking myself if I would go back again. \u00a0For Seven Saints, the answer would be yes, if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go way out of my way to get there.", 
      "Out of towners,.went downtown,found this place word of mouth..nice place,old,i had 2 sliders and potato soup fries,,awesome soup out of this world,my lady had steak sandwich also good,her bloddy mary awesome she said,my draft beer ice cold,waiter on the ball,we will go here again.", 
      "The sweet potato chips with goat cheese cream sauce are a-MAZ-ing. This appetizer is certainly big enough to share with 1-3 other people, depending on how much other food you order. Or you could eat half yourself and take the other half home for lunch the next day. Not that I know anyone who has ever done that...", 
      "When I first tried this place out I was like, \"yea it's ok\" but then I went back three different times with 3 different friends who all love it. One. Cheese Curds, don't tell your weight watcher leader, but order them and thank me later. The black and blue salad was OUT OF THIS WORLD good! Yum! The speciality drinks of the night have never failed me. Good! I even like mine a little sweeter, so I told my waitress and she just had them add a little simple syrup to my liking. :) There's that excellent service for you! I'm now officially a big fan!", 
      "We always, always stop here when we are in town. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal at Seven Saints.Firstly, there's an expansive beer and whiskey list. In terms of appetizers--we are hardly ever people who order starters, but we usually do here. Fried mushrooms, cheese curds, onion rings--they're all good and don't make you feel gross afterwards like some other places do.The salads are big and hearty. Sliders offer lots of options. And their menu allows you to mix and match things to meet your taste. Personally I like the red pepper gouda soup when they have it and the southwest chipotle chicken salad. The wait staff is friendly, but not what I'd call amazing. The vibe inside feels warm and plush. Overall, if this place was in my neighborhood, I'd be a regular.", 
      "Came here last night about 8pm. The ambience is nice almost like a downtown Chicago feel and the food is good too. Notice I said good, cuz the $4 sliders I had were decent but not worth it. I tried a local Triptych Brewing beer called Blueberry Blonde that they had on tap & it was fairly warm but gud. All in all I had a mediocre experience but I will giv em another shot.", 
      "The sweet potato chips with goat cheese dip are phenomenal - perfect combo of sweet and salty. Sliders are decent - left a little to be desired but overall good. Salads are fresh, tasty - really a lot of great options, nice atmosphere and extensive drink list.", 
      "I really like coming to Seven Saints for the food. I also enjoy a beer or cocktail on occasion. I love the cheese curds. The tomato bisque is my favorite soup of theirs and every now and then I'll have different sliders with my soup. I've also had some of the regular sized sandwiches and those were all good as well. They have an extensive libations menu.", 
      "I came here for Whiskey Wednesday, which is 50% off select whiskey flavors. If you don't know what that is, then you have to make sure you check out ALL of the discount alcohol nights at Seven Saints because they are all deals you should take advantage of!The whiskey I got was Snake River Stampede. Mainly because I thought it was funny that it was considered a \"rodeo whiskey\" and also that the description for it said \"this whisky can still kick like a bucking bronco when served neat.\" haha.Another nice thing is that they alcohol menu has two featured House drinks and a description for both. This makes it a bit easier while choosing a drink and you don't have to ask the waitress/waiter about every single drink. Even though my server was nice enough to do it if asked.I got the Triple \"S\" Platter (Slider, 1/2 Salad, and a Side). I got the cheese slider, 1/2 Caesar salad and waffle fries. I liked all the food. Their waffle fries were really good.Up until I tried Seven Saints, I only thought of sliders as the little burgers you get from White Castle, but Seven Saints is now my favorite place to get them. I'll definitely be back soon.", 
      "Good food. Good service. Good location. Friendly atmosphere. Sliders to die for. Great drink selection. Drunk pecan pie with ice cream to die for again.", 
      "This is sort of in response to a defamatory social media campaign against Seven Saints that includes a review here posted a few days ago, but I will keep my review to Seven Saints and not mention this again.I've attended Whiskey Wednesday every week for over six months, and I have sat at the bar next to people of all colors. I've never heard any complaints or noticed any discrimination or racism. People are overwhelmingly happy with their experiences here, as evidenced by how busy it is. Wednesdays do tend to get hectic, so if you are high-maintenance / demanding / have a chip on your shoulder, you may want to pick a different night to go. If you're a normal person like 99% of the other people around, you'll have a good time.With that out of the way, Seven Saints is THE PLACE to drink whiskey, especially on Wednesday, with a 1/2-price special on one of four rotating themes. Every whiskey they have is in one of the themes and will be 1/2-price on its respective day. They have an incredible selection with a whole menu page or two for each theme. The bartenders that work that night are passionate about whiskey and it shows. They know their stuff and can always make a good recommendation based on what you like, tell you why they recommend it for you, tell you what to look for, and answer any questions.", 
      "This place is nothing short of fantastic, especially for food, but drink as well.Food: So tasty. The sliders, the cheese kurds appetizer, the waffle fries. I particularly recommend the buffalo chicken slider- easily my favorite. Do yourself a favor and ask the waiter/waitress his/her opinion on the amount of food you order- it's very easy to order too much for your party to handle.Beer: Some great seasonal beers on tap for not too much $. You can expect to see draft, seasonal beers for $4, and other beers for cheaper. There are tons of draft and bottled choices. This place has a great bar to sit, watch games, and enjoy an ice cold brew.Service: I was only with one other person so we asked to sit (and eat) at the bar. We had 2,3 staff members (bar tenders) help each other out when it came to waiting on us. They have a team approach- which leads to faster service. The bartenders knew their Illini sports, cared about the downtown Champaign environment by knowing about that weekend's events, and were very down to earth.Overall: I had a fantastic meal, including appetizers, and a beer for $21. A similar place in Chicago would be double that- and the food wouldn't be better either. Downtown Champaign has fantastic bars and eats, and this place is one of them. Seven Saints covers all of the bases- i've eaten here with my family for special occasions, and i've come here in the wee hours of the morning to get my drink on.", 
      "I love Seven Saints!Everything, the food, the beers (good selection of bottle beers and there is always some special on the draft), the fantastic whisky selection (probably the best in town), the bartenders (always helpful and friendly, definitely worth a big fat tip!).Tuesday the draft beers are half-price and Wednesday one type of whisky is half-price (I mean or Bourbon, or Scotch, or American... ok, u get the point).You definitely need to try the sliders, they are what make the bar famous. Also, I really love the rib eye steak sandwich, its pricey ($10), but its amazing and it comes with a side (onion rings are killers in here).There is also the possibility of ordering combos with salad, soup, etc... I never had that, but I heard its pretty good.Bottom line: this place is a MUST in Champaign. During weekend it might get crowded and with a waiting line, usually I go by myself, so I never had that problem.", 
      "Sat over 20 mins waiting for a server. It was slow at 2:30p and they had 2 servers. Asked the manager what was up with the long wait and we were told we hadn't been waiting long. He was rude and we decided to leave based on his response.", 
      "Urbana has a lot of surprises for someone who enjoys nice drinks with great food. This was one of them. They have a great selection of spirits, wine, cocktails and great food. Will not be disappointed.", 
      "Tried out a slider and wasn't very impressed. However, I will say that the tomato bisque is simply delectable and should definitely be tried. What I found odd was that the waiters have numbers as name tags instead of their actual names... Are these waiters nothing but numbers to this establishment? Haha, I hope not.", 
      "Two words - whiskey Wednesday! 50 percent off whiskey will always make me a happy person.. And this place has a lot else to offer, including yummy sliders and a pretty good alcoholic beverage offering. Definitely one of my favorite spots in downtown Champaign!", 
      "The sliders here are good...just a bit on the pricey side. \u00a0I had the buffalo chicken and it was awesome! \u00a0Then i had 1/2 a goat cheese salad which was also very good. \u00a0 I ordered the cheese curds as an appetizer and that was a big mistake... The portion is huge.... They're the size of donut holes (like those ones you get at dunkin donuts) and you get like 12 of them in an order. \u00a0I was full after two.... I'm used to cheese curds being the size of popcorn....not golf balls. \u00a0And the breading on them is very heavy. \u00a0Other than that, i enjoyed the slider/salad combo.", 
      "Good food with a great environment. Came here for lunch, ordered a sandwich, and left with a satisfied belly. However, the food can be really oily, especially the sandwiches and fries.", 
      "This restaurant/bar is conveniently located in downtown Champaign. We sat down around 6PM on a Sunday Night for dinner.Appetizer: Get the half order of pretzels. I believe this is a new menu item which comes with 2 giant soft pretzels, mustard for dipping, and an amazing jalepeno cheese sauce. The pretzel was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt. I could have eaten a bowl of that jalepeno cheese sauce.Main course: I love it when restaurants allow you to combine menu items, like any variety of a soup/ salad/ sandwich combo. At SS, you can definitely create a combo to your liking. I ordered the soup with half sandwich. The price and quality just blew my mind. You think a tomato bisque soup is boring? Seven Saints will change that opinion of yours! I got that tomato bisque soup with half a tuna melt sandwich and i was in food heaven.Dessert: It's very rare that I have room in my stomach for an appetizer, main course, and dessert. Well, I didn't have room, but that didn't stop me from ordering a sweet sensation. The blueberry cheesecake with ginger crust was absolutely incredible, and I don't regret that decision one bit.Service: Impeccable. I ordered an arnold palmer to drink, and I never saw the bottom of my glass. The food was prompt and our server was helpful. Even with the packers vikings game on TV, we had an extremely pleasant time.I know Illinois is known for good food, but man, I was not expecting this amazingness :) A++++++", 
      "I'm just so-so about the food, but I just saw someone else had fried cheese curds there. \u00a0I'll have to try those yet.Hard liquor selection is just f-ing amazing!!!! \u00a0 Sooooo worth the visit. \u00a0The liquor they carry alone is worth the 5 stars.", 
      "The BLT salad is wonderful and the salmon sliders rock. The tomato bisque is really wonderful.", 
      "First off.... they have a real deal drink selection. The beers are just like all the other taps around, (good quality independent brews) I have had a \"steak salad\" ( I forgot the official name of it) and the meat was a bit tough for me, I politely stacked it into a napkin and at the greens. I have rocked some sliders.. those are pretty great. There was a time when I was so very much in the mood for a Tuna Melt. I mean... a good tuna melt is so damn good. I got a tuna salad sandwich with cheese melted onto one of the pieces of bread. Not much tuna melt action. Eye of the beholder though, I get that. I appreciate that they are downtown, and quite busy often. That's good energy, not a bunch of drunko ass frats being all loud and pukey. The staff is absolutely awesome. bar, servers, everyone. My lack of a couple stars is due to the couple of times I didn't really dig the food.", 
      "I love coming here for Whiskey Wednesdays. Every week they pick a category of whiskey to be half-off. They have a great selection and usually some off-menu specials. They really know their whiskey so this is a great place to try something new of you have discriminating taste. This is possibly my favorite feature of any bar in the area.They always have a nice selection of beer on tap too (at a nice range of prices) and have recently started \"Brewsdays\" with some nice beer specials.Seven Saints has some quality food too. Sliders, salads, sides, desserts... It's all delicious. Definitely try the sweet potato fries or beet chips. My only complaint about the menu is that, since I tend to order vegetarian, the options can get a little stale (though you can sub in a veggie burger on any of their sliders).My favorite meal? California Turkey Slider (sub a veggie burger, hold the bacon), waffle fries, and the Southwest Chipotle Salad.And last, but not least, the atmosphere: Seven Saints feels classy, but not so classy that you'll feel underdressed if you show up in a t0shirt and jeans. It's a darker feel and the furniture and decorations are detailed and thought-out. Even when it's busy, they bar doesn't get too terribly loud so it's great for a date or a night out with friends if you'd like to be able to have a conversation at the table.", 
      "If you're too lazy to read my novel (no judgment) here is a summary:Seven Saints = awesome.I'm sure you've seen a lot of 5 star reviews on Yelp! and thought to yourself, \"this person's 5 star is probably a 3 in my book\" so I think you need a little back-story to understand just how hard it is to score the coveted 5 red stars in my book.I'm high maintenance. I'm also spoiled. I'm from California where there are actually more than six places to choose from for cocktails and late-night dining. It's not that I don't love quaint little Champaign-Urbana, but if a place doesn't \u00a0live up to your expectations, there are not many other options to choose from. \u00a0Ask any of my friends: they heard me complain about this for months when I first moved here over three years ago.... Then I found Seven Saints. This place excels in everything I look for: customer service, quality product, and environment. As you can see from the pictures, the ambiance is warm, intimate and inviting. The seating and decor create an environment that is perfect for enjoying time with a date, group of friends, coworkers, and even people you don't really like but are forced to hang out with once in a while. Their menu has what I like to think of as fancy versions of classic Midwestern treats. They are famous for their sliders--try the Black Jack Slider, come back here, and thank me. Or go for the hat trick and add on the Salmon Slider and California Turkey Slider and thank me three times. The lovely waitresses & waiters are always friendly and attentive. It's amazing how they stay on top of tables & orders when it gets busy. As for drinks, I'm just starting to learn about beer and they have a wide selection to choose from. Tuesdays they have beer specials, which is a great time to sample things I wouldn't normally order. And now for my favorite part: Whiskey Wednesday. I've waited over two years to write this review because I treated Whiskey Wednesday like Fight Club... it's so awesome, you aren't supposed to talk about it. The guilt has pushed me and I feel it is now time to let those of you who don't know in on this marvelous secret: every Wednesday they feature 50% off their whiskey menu. That's right. This isn't a fake-out Miko's 50% off either. This is an unbelievable selection of quality whiskeys from around the world... for half the price. They rotate weeks from North American, Irish, Bourbon and Scotch in addition to weekly featured bottles. I'm not cool enough to call myself a whiskey connoisseur, but I am very stuck up about my whiskey. The two Whiskey Wednesday bartenders are amazing and are always able to find new and exciting things for me behind the bar. They REALLY know their stuff. Try it. Go in and pick any whiskey off the menu. They can tell you about the grain, barrels, aging process, blend--everything. I can't even remember what I had for lunch yesterday. They are extremely helpful and know the full range of whiskey flavors. I've been in many times with friends who don't drink whiskey often, or are just starting out and want to go easy. It doesn't matter how experienced you are, the Whiskey Wednesday boys will take care of you. Andy is the general manager and I can never say too many good things about him. At most other restaurants, you'll see the manager walking around to check things out, but that's about it. Andy introduces himself and actually talks to the customers. He is always around to make sure people have a good experience. It's a pleasure to listen to him tell you about the history behind a specific bottle or cocktail. If you've seen him on the CBS morning show, you can tell how passionate he is about what he does. So yes, I just gushed about Seven Saints--but I mean every word of it. The quality products & excellent customer service are enough to satisfy this high-maintenance Californian. I'm also narcissistic enough to believe you'll actually come back on here to thank me. Seriously. Go check them out. I'll see you again soon.", 
      "I absolutely love Seven Saints. The ambiance is a sort of cool Southern French with its rustic and ornate decor, and dim lighting. The service was good. We ordered the sweet potato fries and a variety of the signature sliders. The fries were really good and the sliders were packed with flavor. My personal favorites among the sliders include the Black Jack (loved the spicy kick), California Turkey (I ordered it with chicken instead), and Salmon (simply delish).Overall: great food, reasonable prices, and good ambiance.", 
      "I am torn over what to do with Seven Saints. \u00a0When I first went there I thought the food was great and the drinks were wonderful. \u00a0Over time, it has lost its luster. \u00a0What follows is my progression.My first visit was mostly about the drinks. \u00a0I found the beer menu to be decent (which is what I felt like drinking that night). \u00a0I know I ordered food and I was not displeased with it. \u00a0Overall, my first experience was good and I came back for more. \u00a0My next visit included food and drinks. \u00a0I went with some sort of mixed drink that tasted fine but was not memorable. \u00a0I had the salmon slider to eat. \u00a0I did not notice if the menu listed what came with the slider or not, and the waitress did not bother to mention that the slider come with just the sandwich. \u00a0When I got my slider I realized that one mini sized salmon sandwich was not going to be enough for dinner. \u00a0Sadly, I started eating the slider before I ordered more food. \u00a0I can only describe it as a salty salmon puck. \u00a0After that, I was no longer hungry, and we went elsewhere.I returned for lunch, and had the BLT salad with the tomato soup. \u00a0I recommend both options. \u00a0The soup was so good that I came back for lunch again and paired it with the tomato pesto grilled cheese. \u00a0This was also wonderful. \u00a0In fact it was so good that I found myself craving the soup and grilled cheese one day so I went for lunch. \u00a0Now, I am not a fan of swiss cheese which is one of the cheeses in the sandwich. \u00a0I requested that the swiss cheese be replaced with provolone instead. \u00a0When I got my sandwich there was no swiss cheese, but there was no other cheese on the sandwich. \u00a0There should have been American cheese as well. \u00a0I guess the server misunderstood my request, and I figured it was an honest mistake so I didn't think it was a big deal.The last straw was yesterday. \u00a0I went for lunch again and ordered the tomato pesto grilled cheese with the tomato soup. \u00a0Again I requested that the swiss be replaced with provolone. \u00a0When I got my sandwich it was more like toast than a grilled cheese. \u00a0There was one slice of American cheese and one slice of provolone cheese on each piece of bread, but the cheese was not melty and gooey. \u00a0It was toasted and crispy. \u00a0Then the pesto was glopped on in one cold dollop. \u00a0I found the sandwich to be dry. From now on I will probably only go to this place for the drinks. \u00a0Too bad I can find drinks at just about any bar in town. \u00a0I feel let down because I really wanted to like this place. \u00a0I love the look and feel of the bar, and it has all the potential to be great. \u00a0However, if they can't even accomplish a grilled cheese sandwich why would you want to eat their food?", 
      "Went there last Wednesday. Service was friendly and prompt even though they were very busy. My boyfriend is really into Whiskey and had heard that they had a great selection. According to him they have one of the best Whiskey selection he has ever seen. The staff also seemed to be very informed about the liquor they were serving.I order an assortment of sliders and my BF had the crab cakes and the chicken floutas. All the food was very good but the crab cakes were the star of the evening.Great date night, very reasonably priced, very warm atmosphere.", 
      "The Boy and I came here because we saw a Capital Brewery sign floating in the window like a neon beacon of hope and happiness. \u00a0We sat at the bar and perused the beer list. \u00a0Sadly, the only Capital beer they had came in the form of cans of the Island Wheat. \u00a0Ew, and oh no. \u00a0Fortunately, the rest of the beer list was fairly extensive and diverse.But what's this? \u00a0Cheese curds?! \u00a0Oh, Seven Saints. \u00a0You have cut to the core of this simple Wisconsin girl. So, we ordered the cheese curds, a Rogue Dead Guy Ale and an Anchor Steam (solid beer choices, if you're in the market). The cheese curds were not cheese curds.....they were palm-sized balls of mozzarella with a light, gooey breading on them. \u00a0And they came with a delicious marinara sauce. \u00a0Let me tell you something: These 'curds' are not f'n around. \u00a0They are formidable. \u00a0We couldn't finish them, they were so heavy. \u00a0How is it that Illinois managed to out-fat bastard Wisconsin? \u00a0Go figure. \u00a0Seven Saints is a very pretty bar, at least at night. \u00a0All espresso-dark wood and nice lighting. \u00a0And the jukebox was interesting. \u00a0When we first got in there, the crowd all seemed slightly older....so it was very odd that some new hip hop/hump dancey song was bumping over the stereo. \u00a0Swiftly and even more randomly, the jukebox changed over to super hits of my early adolescence: Blind Melon, Spin Doctors, and even some Van Halen. \u00a0I was okay with this, if not a little more than amused.When it comes right down to it, we all know I'm coming back.", 
      "I am from Champaign, raised there until the age of 20, when I escaped to Austin. I still go back every year for Christmas to visit family and friends, and when I do, Seven Saints is a must-hit place for food. And I get the same thing every single time.The Triple S Combo Platter. One salmon slider. BLT salad (although I have also tried the Country Fried Chicken Salad... sounds weird but was really tasty). And the tomato basil soup. This is a trifecta of yumminess in my tumminess. There has only been once when the food all tasted kind of off, possibly a bad day. But every year, it always pleases me. And the bill isn't so bad. I don't really drink here, but have had a mojito that was alright, nothing special. I will continue frequenting this establishment for my yearly Christmas visiting. Please stay in business Seven Saints, otherwise I will be forced to make this food on my own and it won't be pretty.", 
      "I wasn't expecting much from Seven Saints, yet somehow I still left disappointed.There doesn't appear to be a beer menu, perhaps because they're really proud of their Jameson and Red Bull cocktails (ick) and would rather advertise those on your table. \u00a0This would be okay if they hadn't hidden the drafts behind columns such that it's impossible to discover what types of beer they have.The food menu was more promising. \u00a0It's split into two parts: \u00a0half the items were ripped off from Crane Alley (beet chips with goat cheese, sweet potato fries, cajun crab cake) and the other half are \"sliders\". \u00a0Upscale White Castle.Frankly, the food wasn't particularly bad. \u00a0My friend enjoyed his salad. \u00a0But it wasn't particularly good either: \u00a0his slider was only so-so and my sandwich was like a salt lick. \u00a0But I probably would have gone back just to break up the monotony of eating downtown if the service hadn't sucked.When our waitress finally got around to us, I ordered a sandwich. \u00a0She came back five minutes later to tell me that there had been a \"permanent substitution\" with that item. \u00a0By substitution, she meant that it was nothing at all like the description - perhaps it still had the same kind of bread.When I told her I didn't want this new sandwich, she made a big deal out of me being \"too picky,\" and telling me that the kitchen was now going to be mad at her.\"Permanent substitution\"? \u00a0Seriously, print new menus and lose the attitude.", 
      "Every time I come here, it's on a whim and it becomes some accidental hetero man-date with my friend Nathan.That said, the sliders are pretty good, the appetizers are good, but avoid the whole fried food platter. \u00a0You'll pray that your greasy oily body explode after a few too many fried cheese curds or mushrooms. \u00a0Damn.Beer selection is pretty large, but look out for a slightly odd and random crowd on Friday nights. \u00a0One night: an entire party of cougars hitting on a waiter, a drunk guy wandering from table to table in an attempt to watch the game, a bunch of townie girls trying to be \"classy\" and failing miserably (drunk plus booty shorts plus heels = No).That said, drinks are strong, beer selection is nice, and food is pretty decent. \u00a0Not a bad choice for eats.", 
      "Cheese curds taste so good here. Many choices for sliders and they taste good too. Nice environment and the server was very nice and friendly. Great place!", 
      "This place has so much potential, so it's kind of sad that they don't have better service.... My fiance and I waited at the bar for a drink for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us what we wanted. That may not sound too long, but the place wasn't even busy. And what's funny is the bartender was like purposely ignoring us. There's no way she didn't see us politely flagging her down. She had a soft drink that she was drinking, and she stopped right in front of us, took a nice looooong drink... kind of relaxing, then she looked past us out the window, and proceeded to ignore us a bit longer. And its not like we were just standing there, you can try and flag them down, but they just ignore you like alien possessed humans staring into space or something. The bartender finally asked what we wanted, but by then we were being seated so we said nevermind. Then we proceeded to have terrible service at our table, to the point that it was just kind of amusing. Oh and my cobb salad had these huge mushroom tentacle things that made me gag and we just sorta wiggled them at our friends like \"look at this huge sick thing that's in my salad!\" And the sliders are way over priced. The cheese curds were good, but a little heavy. I say the place has potential because it's a really nice location and the inside has a nice ambiance. There is also an extensive beer list, but none of that really matters if your service is that bad..."

      "I took the Amtrak down to U of I for a football game this past weekend vs. Michigan (Illinois won - SWEET). The train got in over an hour late (which seems to be a common occurrence on this route), but I was still a few hours early for the game, so I grabbed some lunch at this place, which is right across the street from the Amtrak station. I was happy to see that it was not jam packed on game day morning. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was impressed with the large selection of beers available, both on tap and by the bottle. I'm used to Chicago prices, so being able to get a good draft beer for under 5 bucks was great. They also have Miller High Life on tap for $2 if you're looking to go \"cheap.\"Food wise, I went with a couple turkey sliders, since the menu claims that is what they are \"famous\" for. I also had some of the sweet potato fries. The sliders were just okay, I wasn't blown away by them or anything. Same thing with the fries. The portion was large, but I wasn't crazy about them (I went ahead and doused them in ketchup after I realized they weren't that good). It was a meal that was adequate, and not expensive (each slider was $2.50 and the fries were $1.99 if I am remembering correctly), so I'm not complaining. My total for 2 draft beers, the food, and tip was just over $20.The bartender introduced himself as \"Billy Mays\" and had on an Oxyclean shirt, which was his Halloween costume. He was nice enough and occasionally engaged in small talk, even as the place started to get more crowded. I didn't have any problems with him keeping my water and beer full, and my food was correct, so no issues there.When all is said and done, I can't give this place 5 stars simply because I wasn't blown away by anything. But this is definitely a sold 4 star establishment.", 
      "Ate here on Saturday, March 15th, 2014.Yow. \u00a0We ordered our drinks, and they came out quick. \u00a0We followed that with an order of cheese curds which were pretty good overall. \u00a0From there, it was sliders and salad or sides.I ordered the Jack slider, and it was pretty darn good. \u00a0The food came out fairly fast, and the prices didn't break the bank.One weird thing - employees wore numbers instead of names. \u00a0I had visions of \"The Prisoner\" flash through my head \"I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed or numbered - my life is my own.\" \u00a0The restrooms were clean. \u00a0All in all, a good visit.", 
      "I'd probably give this joint 3.5 stars, but I'll make do with 4 since it was a great weekend. \u00a0Pros:1. \u00a0Good beer list. \u00a0Left Hand Milk Stout for $4.50? \u00a0This Chicago girl says yes, please. \u00a02. \u00a0Tasty food. \u00a0I had the slider/salad/sweet potato fries combo, and everything was really good. \u00a0They're known for their sliders, apparently.3. \u00a0Great vibe. \u00a0We didn't feel rushed here. \u00a0Didn't feel pressured to drink more, and they didn't blink when our party size doubled and we moved to a different table. \u00a0Cons:1. \u00a0Small-ish portions: \u00a0At $10 for the above-mentioned meal, I felt a little.....unsatisfied. \u00a0The sliders seem pricey at \u00a0$3+ a pop, too. \u00a02. \u00a0Service: \u00a0A bit slow. \u00a0It picked up when we started strictly drinking, but there was nary a condiment to be found during our meal. \u00a0All in all, I'd head back. \u00a0It's a nice joint in downtown Champaign.", 
      "I have a couple friends that work here and they say they like it. I came into visit shortly after it opened and it's never been overly packed (except the outdoor seating is always full), which is nice. I'd say it's more for an older crowd or at least a more relaxed one. The variety of beer and wine is awesome. I thought the sliders there were delicious, same with the soups and salads. Of all of the bars downtown, this one definitely has the best food.The actual atmosphere on the other hand is really nice. There are old pews, vintage chandeliers, and a beautiful wooden piece in the back of the main room all from old Churches, and it was the 7th bar opened by the owner, hence the name Seven Saints. It's all pretty cute and makes a nice place to have an outside dinner. I'd recommend it for sure!", 
      "Been years since I have been here..Finally headed back and wasn't impressed with the fact their entire menu is fried. \u00a0Well with the exception of the hummus and sliders. \u00a0They got rid of their cheese curds. \u00a0:(Their Manhattans are good though... --------------------------------------------------\u00ad--------------------------------------------It seems like a Guido's wannabe meaning.. the decor is nice and could be posh. \u00a0Not so many people frequent there unfortunately. \u00a0So it's not a trendy place as of now.It's an okay place.. I don't really like any of their specialty drinks. \u00a0I tried the Jamiebull (not enough Redbull or Jameson) and the Lemon Shakeup (too sweet). \u00a0I have tried their sliders (which is like a mini burger).. they are decent but they aren't terribly big and kind of pricey if you get three of them (which is equivalent to one burger). \u00a0I haven't had any outstanding salads here either unfortunately.I would try it if you want a change in scenery from Guido's and Boltini's.", 
      "Went here for lunch today and it was just so-so. \u00a0I ordered half portobella mushroom sandwich and half black and blue salad. \u00a0I love salads but this one just wasn't right. \u00a0The steak in it was so chewy. \u00a0I took it off the salad but then the salad was still warm. \u00a0It had grilled onions and mushrooms on it which I find odd. \u00a0I think it's weird to have grilled onions in a salad. \u00a0Maybe it's me but it's just not right.The mushroom sandwich was soggy and not very good. \u00a0Actually the mushrooms were just fine but putting it together in a sandwich with cheese and red peppers just didn't do it for me. \u00a0They do not go together in my opinion. Basically, I found both items odd.The server was great and the food came out fast I will give them credit for that. \u00a0I have been here a few times and this is not a place that I would volunteer up if someone was asking for suggestions where to eat.Some people love it and some people don't.", 
      "My first few trips to Seven Saints were excellent. The place had just opened. The service was excellent. This would have been a four star review had that not changed. Perhaps the owners need to start dropping back in or have people mystery shop the place.The menu - while not wildly innovative - was well thought out. The appetizers are well done and set up to share, though the fried portabella mushroom strips on the Seven Sinners plate had that 'I've sat in cold storage' flavor to them. That said, the cheese curds and also the beet chips were excellent. I liked the sliders - favoring the blackjack and the buffalo chicken slider. The triple-S plate used to be more of a deal when they would allow you to get two sliders and either a soup or salad. I was sorry to see that go. I've not tried the specials, and each time I've been everyone has done sliders, sandwiches, soup, or salads - so I cant speak to them. The desserts are nothing special, but were decently presented.Out first few trips, the staff was excellent. \u00a0We were seated relatively quickly despite being packed. Someone came to take our drink orders in the first few minutes. The waitress was willing to explain things to my party and make substitutions to satisfy vegetarian friends. The beer selection was decent and the mixed drinks were decently strong. While prices were a bit on the steep side, we were fairly happy. On a later trip, the service was slow, the raspberry iced tea was short on the raspberry syrup, and to be frank - I felt rushed out the door once we were done with our entree. That was too bad as the people I was with are the sort prone to ordering dessert and a couple rounds of drinks. If the place was crowded, I could have understood, but it seemed sort of empty.Other reviews have mentioned a chain-like feel. It's true the same group owns a few other local bars - so I'm assuming they use the same architects, designers, and back-office staff. That said, I kind of like the decor and think with a little work on the service Seven Saints could warrant four stars.", 
      "My teammates and I tried doing as many different places for lunch while on assignment in town, and of all the places we did, we found ourselves here the most. I can honestly say that we did not have a single bad meal here. The tomato pesto grilled cheese is amazing. Their lunch combos are just the perfect amount of food. All of the soups were tasty - my favorite was probably the Italian Wedding. Nice atmosphere and consistently good service; would return if ever in the area again.", 
      "Most people come here for the sliders, but I'm going to tell you about a little known gem on their menu: the ribeye steak sandwich.This. Sandwich.Agh. It's just.. it's so good. I've always been a ribeye steak fan, and in my teens when I first learned they make sandwiches out of them, I think I cried tears of joy. Ever since my first bite, I've been on the hunt for the next best ribeye sandwich.. and my friends, I search no more.I order mine blackened, medium-rare, with their delicious waffle fries. The first time I decided on this sandwich, I didn't have high expectations. I had ordered sliders here in the past and found them just okay. However, when they brought out my huge, melty, tender, delicious sandwich, I could hear the angels singing. It was GLORIOUS. I ate every single bite, and within 2 days I found myself back at Seven Saints, ordering another. This is my all time favorite steak sandwich, and I order it often.Aside from this amazing sandwich, the service is always good and the atmosphere is friendly and inviting. They even have ginger ale on tap, YES! Anytime I've been less than 100% satisfied, the staff has been completely accommodating and has removed any problem item from the bill, AFTER replacing it for me. I couldn't have better things to say about this establishment!", 
      "I give it a three stars because the food tasted just okay and the service was slow. What we ordered was a tonic water and a IPA beer, one appetizer, and four sliders and a salad. We had two different servers and we stated we were hungry. And, what we got came in the following order: (1) a fast tonic water, and then, (2) a slow and not so generous portion of sweet potato fries; and then, (3) an even slower set of four different sliders, and (4) salad and then (5) my IPA beer. \u00a0Regarding the food, the salmon slider had a significant kick to it - I recommend it. But, there was no kick to the bratwurst with sauerkraut; the sauerkraut was bland and Dijon? \u00a0Also, the turkey slider had flavorless red peppers and would have benefited from larger slice of avocado or mashed avocado given the portion size. The others were not so worth mentioning. Waiting for my beer and food seemed silly given that it seemed like a slow Tuesday night. This place earned its three because the salmon slider and fries were good and the beer list looked great. Maybe we just ordered wrong and had the wrong servers?", 
      "This place couldn't be any better!! My boyfriend and I went today for lunch, I got the turkey slider and the Cajun bean and rice soup, while he also got the turkey slider and the 7 saints salad. We sat outside and it was a gorgeous day, our waitress was really helpful and it was so hard to choose what to order!We both agreed that we could eat here everyday for a month and be happy. His salad was unbelievable- the sesame dressing was mouth watering. I'm from Chicago just visiting here but I would come back just for the turkey sliders. If you eat you have to go here!", 
      "At Seven Saints, the extremely dim lighting was quite flattering to my features but horrible for doing homework,the oldies tunes streaming from the speakers were super fantastic and chill,the server was very attentive, yetmy Rogue Dead Guy Ale tasted watered down. :/All of my other brews were quite good, though.", 
      "My favorite place for: Whiskey Wednesday, \u00a0giant cheese curds, and tomato bisque soup.", 
      "I've been a couple times, and on my most recent trip was pretty darn satisfied. Yes, there are finer restaurants in CU, yes there are cheaper bars, and yes there are better crowds, however I sure enjoyed the hell out of my last trip. Here's why: they have an excellent liquor selection with a focus on Irish, Scotch, and Bourbon Whiskies. Their food menu has a nice balance of innovation and old standards and was well-executed for everything our group of 6 ordered. Service is quick (turn and burn, baby!) even when they're full. If you are careful, the food and drink is actually quite reasonably priced: soup/sandwich combo, 2x beers, huge club with excellent sweet potato fries all for $30 (whiskey tab was a different story- but worth it). You certainly could spend more on you food here, but if you get the cheap stuff you will still be happy. Also, on Wednesdays, they have HALF price on all their whisky/ey!The bartender also runs classes on the appreciation of this complex but enthralling (some would even say intoxicating) beverage.", 
      "This is one of my favorite places to grab dinner and drinks with friends, but only when I have a lot of time on my hands.The food is good and the prices are on the high side of fair. \u00a0The problem is the service. \u00a0Really slow and with an attitude, no matter when you go or who your server/bartender is. \u00a0They seem unable to handle a crowd of more than about 3 tables without the staff having a melt down.I go because I like the food, they have a good beer list, and the place is quiet enough that you can actually talk to the people you're with. \u00a0It's a really nice place to kill a few hours and catch up with old friends.", 
      "This is one of my favorite local restaurants in CU. First of all, the atmosphere is really amazing. A lot of care was taken to make the inside of this place something special. It has a slightly dark, gothic feel yet it still feels very cozy and inviting. I do wish the space was a bit bigger, however, as it can get busy very quickly and you'll run out of places to sit.Service-wise I've almost always had great service. The wait-staff is friendly and the bartenders are fast and responsive. They have a nice selection of spirits. The best part has to be the food, though. They have a nice selection of salads. My absolute favorite is the Seven Saints Salad. I've never tasted anything quite like it. It has a crisp bed of greens topped with tiny hot green peppers and a VERY generous portion of pieces of steak. The steak is flavorful and moist and the whole salad has a clear dressing that compliments the other components perfectly. The best part is that you can have the salad as part of a special served with a couple of their sliders for around $8. It's a great deal.Speaking of their sliders, they have a really wonderful selection of mini-hamburgers. They aren't as heavily greasy as you might expect from a traditional slider. My favorites are probably the Asian slider with it's wasabi spread, the Buffalo Chicken slider (with an amazing sauce on a crispy piece of chicken and served with ranch dip) and the Blacjack burger. There are a ton more and pretty much anything to suit your taste.Another standout aspect of Seven Saints are their appetizers. If I have one complaint it's that they seem incapable of keeping their Beet Chips ready to order. Out of the five times I've tried to order them, I've only ever been able to get them twice. I don't know if I've just had bad timing or what but I do wish they were a bit more diligent with those. If you do manage to order them they are delicious and are served with a yummy goat cheese dip. If they are out of them, there are still a lot of great options. You can't go wrong with either of their mushroom appetizers.", 
      "This place is \"known\" for their sliders and I was impressed with the fact that they offered a vegetarian boca burger patty as a substitute for all their burgers. I really liked the atmosphere of the bar. It was a great place to watch the game I think next time but will just go for drinks since I didn't think the food was so great. I ordered the salmon slider and the salmon was so salty it was inedible. The other slider I ordered was okay nothing to rave about but the worst was the California turkey burger my friend ordered. The menu said it had avocado on it which it did but it was such a minuscule amount we literally cracked up about it.Its a clean bar and quiet enough to watch a game AND still hear the commentary but you might want to eat before you get there though.", 
      "This is a nice little place. Nice staff, cool decor.I ordered the goat cheese salad (spring greens, grapes, strawberries, goat cheese, sweet roasted walnuts, and fruity vinaigrette) and a salmon slider. The food was decent... Loved the salad, but might not get the salmon again as the flavors just didn't work for me. However, they do substitute boca patties on any of the other sliders for $0.50 extra so I might try that next time.What I really like about this place is the strong drinks! Two drinks and I had a nice buzz, and I'm normally not a two-drink lady. The signature cocktails listed on their menu are pricey, but I ordered a Tom Collins (not on the menu) and it was $3.50, which is pretty good in my book.", 
      "Pretzels were ok. Tomato bisque soup was delicious. Server was nice. Kept our sodas filled. Nice environment.", 
      "I had excellent service here. I ordered the \"asian slaw\" slider (with boca burger... not my favorite veggie burger thing but it went well with the wasabi aioli they put on it. I also had the southwest chipotle salad which was excellent, and a Fever Tree ginger ale, which was pretty cool to find in somewhere other than a beverage store. My wife's lunch came with sweet potato fries and they were awesome! I've always liked these and have been disappointed by ones that I've found recently. These were top notch. Overall, I was really pleased. For lunch for two, a Rogue Amber beer and the ginger ale, the bill was about $22. Very reasonable.", 
      "I just cannot get into this place. Food is ok. I've had the buffalo sliders which are spicy, the cheeseburger one, which is ok, and the brat which is good. Not impressed with beer list. I guess I feel like I always go there and want it to be a bar, but it's more like I get trapped in a booth.Some of their other food is not good (hummus, BLT, club sandwich). Drinks are ok.", 
      "I've been wanting to go here since I moved to Illinois since I have heard a lot of good things about it. \u00a0Finally my co-workers decided to make this the weekly spot to go out to eat, so I was more than happy to tag along. \u00a0We went around 12 noon, on a weekday. \u00a0The inside is pretty cozy and nicely decorated. \u00a0It's almost imperial looking with the large hanging drapes as curtains. \u00a0We had a large group of 10, and fortunately we were able to get a table. \u00a0The place itself seems very large, as there were from what I could tell, 3 distinct areas to sit in, and an outside dining area as well.All and all though, the place came across as very average to me once everything was said and done. \u00a0 Granted the restaurant was pretty busy, it took our server literally 15 minutes to come get our order, and another 15 to just get our drinks (and most of us just had water).The food did not take too long to come out, but once again I wasn't impressed at all. \u00a0I got the club sandwich with waffle fries, and I can't say it was bad at all, but there was just not a thing special about it. \u00a0It's your typical greasy fare typee of place too... Fries oozing grease, bread and buns slathered with butter, etc. \u00a0I also tried some of the cheese curds (sounds disgusting, but quickly found out it's just like a round mozerella stick), waffle fries, sweet potato fries, and a classic slider (which apparently is what they are known for... sliders that is) \u00a0All of it was just very average, and even the acclaimed slider was nothing special. \u00a0I would probably not go here again if I had the choice, but other than I long wait to get waited on and an even longer one to get some drinks, there is really nothing too major I can dock the restaurant for other than it just did not appeal to me much personally. \u00a0I should note our server was very friendly, but I just can't really get into the food. \u00a0Just a very average joint.", 
      "I called in a carry-out order since I need to eat at my desk for lunch. \u00a0I have had drinks there before, and had their sweet potato fries for a side. \u00a0They were good, so thought I'd give it another try.I was really disappointed. \u00a0I got a BBQ slider and soup for the side. \u00a0When I got to work and opened up the container, I felt jipped. \u00a0What I had was a slider---yes, a teeny tiny burger. \u00a0The soup was in a container not much bigger than one you'd get salad dressing in. \u00a0I will say they both tasted good. \u00a0Not great. \u00a0Not special. \u00a0I could have gone to Merryann's and gotten twice as much at half the price.....and they can do greasy burgers, too. \u00a0You can also get sweet potato fries lots of places. \u00a0I just wasn't impressed. \u00a0Won't be going there again.", 
      "My wife an I ate there 1-9-12, for lunch. Ordered the cheese curds as an appetizer. For lunch I ordered 2 cheeseburger sliders, my wife had soup and one slider. The food was delicious, the service was great. Food came out fast, but wasn't rushed. Nice decor inside, felt warm and inviting. When we visit our son again at Illinois we will bring him with us.", 
      "Sliders are what this place is all about. Each one is between 3 to 4 dollars and tastes great for the price. It takes only about 3 to 4 sliders to fill you up, meaning this place has got some bang for its buck. The atmosphere here is great but the place is very noisy on a busy day. It's a place worth giving a shot, and even if you don't find yourself to be a fan at least it wouldn't be an expensive lesson.", 
      "This is another bar/restaurant in downtown Champaign. They are going for a more upscale look than say the Blind Pig or Mike 'n Molly's. Everything is very clean, and spotless. There is a wood bar and lots of tables and booths abound. Again, very nice and clean. Not a lot of character, but enjoyable.The quality is fine. Nothing wrong with the taps or bottles. The service is decent as far as taking orders and knowing what they have. Though I had to argue with several bartenders to get a half pint of a Barleywine. I don't know why that should be an argument?The food is decent. Though I am not really a fan of everything being a \"slider.\" That makes a lot of the menu a la cart. My first visit, I ended up with a steak salad, but there was not much steak to be seen. What was there was tough and chewy. \u00a0The salad was a bit slimy as well. \u00a0The sliders are nothing bad, they just never seem to live up to what I would expect from the description.Besides a few decent offerings, the tap list is pretty generic. Eight taps that consist of Blue Moon, Fat Tire Guinness, Magic Hat, some BMC, Southern Tier Seasonal, and a managers choice (Arcadia Barleywine when I first visited). \u00a0That rotates a bit, so the selection does change. \u00a0The bottle list somewhat makes up for the sub par tap list. Mostly the usual suspects like Rogue, Bells, Goose Island, Founders, etc. Overall decent, but not ground breaking (considering the handful of really good beer bars in walking distance).Overall, just an average place to grab a beer and a meal. A slightly above average beer selection, and slightly above average food. There is really nothing that distinguishes this place above the many other restaurant in the area, and there are much better beer bars in the area without a doubt.", 
      "I stopped here for lunch a couple weeks ago and the food was eh. \u00a0 The decor is cool and the service is friendly, so I would recommend going here to drink and not necessarily to eat.For my appetizer I ordered the pretzels. \u00a0The cheese dip they come with was a hit and the pretzels were good. \u00a0For my meal, I ordered the chicken tenders. \u00a0These were pretty disappointing. \u00a0Chicken tenders are normally a safe bet anywhere, but these were over cooked, tough and dry. \u00a0I would not recommend them at all. \u00a0Good thing I filled up on pretzels!", 
      "I've been here a few times, and all the earlier ones were pretty good, but this last time was just horrible. I went here on a Saturday with a group of 12. We got there around 8pm. I knew this place was usually busy but when we put our name in, they said it would take 30 minutes. So we figured we would wait since we had not been there in a long time. After an hour of waiting, they were able to seat 6 people. The other 6 had to wait for an adjacent table to open up. It did not open up for another 30 minutes. So I was just really confused on how they would tell us it would take 30 minutes when really it took 1 hour and 30 minutes. The first half of our group had already ordered for us in an attempt to save some time since everyone was starving. After we were seated, it took about 10 minutes for our server to come ask us what we wanted to drink, and then another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks. The food was alright. I usually get different sliders, but decided to try the steak sandwich. It was pretty good, a little messy though since there was a ton of oil that came with it. After we finished, the guy took all of our plates, and then it took 10 minutes for him to ask us if we were ready for the check. then it took him another 10 minutes to get us the check. And then another 10 minutes to charge all the cards. That was one of the worst dining experiences I've had. Over 2 hours of just waiting for things. You would think that with a larger group, he would have paid more attention to us but guess it doesn't work that way.Like I said earlier, I've been here before and they were ok experiences, which accounts for the 2nd star. But we'll see if I ever go back in the near future. Just pissed that we waited so long when the server kept saying it would be 5-10 more minutes every time we asked.", 
      "I love Seven Saints. Easily my favorite bar in Champaign, and the food's pretty good too.Let's start with the food. The sliders are fantastic. I'm boring and stick to the bacon ones, but on occasion I branch out; the tropical ones are also really good. What really sets this place apart are the chicken tenders, which are the best I've ever tried. They're reasonably priced and listed on the appetizer menu, but totally worth getting as a main course. The tomato bisque is apparently very good as well (but screw tomatoes, I'm sticking with the food).As good as the food is, the bar is even better. While the drinks are a bit expensive, if you come on Wednesday, various whiskeys are half off. They also have specials on Monday and Tuesday for wine and beer, respectively. I love the bar selection, though. Wednesdays are my favorite day, because I come to Seven Saints and try various whiskeys to sort out my likes and dislikes. If you (or someone you know) is trying to get into whiskey, this is a great place to do it. My personal favorites are the Elmer T. Lee and the various shades of Pappy they have (especially the Old Rip Van Winkle which is fantastic). My only quibble is that the whiskey passports are a bit of a ripoff. It's $5 for the little book, but normally that'd also come with some sort of swag (like a t-shirt or glass) when finished. It'd make a nice little memento for finishing the entire (64 entry) passport. Still, a great place and such a minor nitpick it barely merits mentioning. Seven Saints is fantastic.", 
      "Having only consumed their alcohol at an outdoor table, I can't really comment on the interior or the food. \u00a0However, a girl we were with kept praising the waffle fries. \u00a0I thought our drinks were served quickly & were reasonably priced, and I liked the fact that no one was trying to move us inside even though it was midnight and 8 of us were still sitting there. \u00a0I was surprised, and actually though our waitress was joking if, when we asked for the check, she asked if we wanted on check or separate checks. \u00a0I almost expect to get attitude from a server if a two-top asks for separate checks. \u00a0It took her awhile to sort everything out, but hey, she asked for it. \u00a0Kudos to her for making my life a little easier.", 
      "I honestly got all my friends to go here. I went here for a friends birthday and FELL IN LOVE with their food. I ALWAYS get the grilled chicken slider with their honey mustard for dipping and their asian salad, it is seriously to die for yummy!We always get a plate of cheese curds for the table since we can't resist.For the many times I've made a decision to go back to Champaign for a visit, I'll admit, dining at Seven Saints has always heavily swayed my decision towards making the trip!", 
      "I have had drinks and food here twice. \u00a0I was pleased both times, even if their prices make ordering food an occasional thing rather than a regular one. \u00a0The staff were friendly and knowledgeable both times, and they were eager to help suggest drinks to try. \u00a0The cocktails were tasty, although a little on the strong side for my tastes. \u00a0When we had a party too large for the tables in front, they gladly opened the back room for us to all sit at the same table.The sliders were good, the soup was hot and tasty, and I really enjoyed the casual atmosphere of the place. \u00a0I'm glad I'll be going back for my bf's after work outings.", 
      "My wife and in went here about six months ago. The fact that we have not been back since then probably implies something.We had some pretty darn good onion rings for an appetizer. My wife had a Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese sandwich that we thought was pretty good, along with a nice Tomato Bisque. I had a trio of Sliders: Asian, Tropical Stack, and Salmon, served with Sweet Potatoe Fries.I grew up in an area that had White Castle restaurants. Now, I never went there unless pressed, but I do know what a slider is.The problem with these was not the taste, which was fine. Nor the size, which was small. The problem is that sliders are moist / greasy. Now, I'm not saying that having a non-greasy slider is a bad thing from a healthful eating perspective. But if you're going to call something a slider, there has to be something non-dry about it. sigh.Service was friendly.I would like to get back there and try some other items, but we always seem to think of someplace else we'd rather eat.", 
      "This place was recommended to me, and I enjoyed myself. \u00a0When we first walked in, I wasn't sure if I was underdressed, was it a dinner only place, the dark lighting, the fancy decorations, I couldn't tell. \u00a0But the maitre d' was totally welcoming, and when I asked \"Are you food only or can we get drinks?\" he laughed and said it was no problem, and asked where we wanted to sit. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and got us our drinks fast. \u00a0After we sat down, we realized we should have sat outside because of the beautiful weather, but didn't feel like moving. \u00a0I didn't look at the food menu, but a few people I was with ordered food. \u00a0Unfortunately, 2 of the 3 orders were wrong. \u00a0One friend doesn't red meat, and ordered chicken in her salad, only to bite into a piece of steak. \u00a0Another friend said her food was just okay.They had some nice beer choices, and after several years in CA, the prices seemed reasonable. \u00a0And actually, I ordered a beer on tap that I didn't end up liking. \u00a0The bartender saw that I wasn't drinking it, and asked if I wanted something else. \u00a0No problems, no extra charges- it was very considerate. \u00a0Granted, I should have asked for a taste before I bought it, but I would have eventually drank it. \u00a0It was just an extra bonus that I was able to get something else that I really enjoyed. \u00a0Overall, a pleasant experience, and I would recommend it.", 
      "Seven Saints has actually become one of the places that I like to hang out most in downtown Champaign. The manager is incredibly knowledgeable about different hard liquors and cocktails, especially. I've been to a couple tastings there where he has gone through how things are made and why they taste the way they do. He's super cool.The whiskey selection is top notch, the beer selection is respectable, and the ambiance is great.I've also had some of their other food, some of the sliders are really delicious as well as the salads. There are still some items that don't belong on the menu but the majority of their food is great.I would definitely recommend this place to others. Yum.", 
      "Nice selection of Bourbon. \u00a0Need more of a draft selection. \u00a0Tasty sliders, great atmosphere and solid service...makes for a great visit.", 
      "I've eaten here several times and it has been a good experience. The sliders are great and keeps people coming back. I really enjoy the chili and any salad with the marinated sirloin. The have an endless list of drinks. If you're looking for fun place to go out check it out!", 
      "Arguably one of my favorite bars near campus. What a beautiful bar, complete with bartenders who know their whiskey. Go on Whiskey Wednesday for half off all bourbon and whiskey. Their fried cheese curds are also surprisingly delicious. I can't wait to create some more memories in this friendly, inviting bar.", 
      "When at U of I, we invariably end up at Seven Saints. \u00a0We might have wanted to go somewhere else, but some weekends are so hard to get a table at the local restaurants. \u00a0Seven Saints always seems to be able to accommodate, and although I never think the service is spectacular, I can overlook that for the great burgers, pub atmosphere and drink selection. \u00a0I'll be back......",

      "Man, every time I've gone to this place, the food looks a lot better than it tastes. I've found all the food to be incredibly bland. Disappointing because the atmosphere is pretty cool.", 
      "Enjoyed the pretzel appetizer, bisque also good. I usually get the grilled cheese and the beer selection pretty decent, wish i would have asked what else they had on tap before i ordered off the menu.", 
      "This place is amazing. I have yet to find something I don't like here. The atmosphere is really nice. The staff is very attentive and nice. I recommend this place to everyone stopping by town.", 
      "I really hate being up-charged for things that aren't explicitly stated when ordered. \u00a0For instance, I ordered a side of sweet potato fries. \u00a0Fries come out. \u00a0We get asked if we want some goat cheese cream to go with it. \u00a0The bf says, \"sure.\" \u00a0It comes out when we have two fries left for an extra $1.50. \u00a0I don't even like goat cheese! \u00a0Same goes for their pretzel. \u00a0They give a tiny portion of jalape\u00f1o cheese and some mustard. \u00a0We didn't like the mustard, so we asked for a little more cheese...that was an extra $0.50. \u00a0The money isn't a big deal, but it is annoying to find these little charges on the final bill when we were gonna just tip more anyways. \u00a0After several dinners here, it just seems like a customer service isn't a huge priority.", 
      "Seven Saints has plenty of options of all kinds if you're looking for a place to get a drink, but you prefer something outside the normal bar fare. I also had the 7 Sinners apperizer plate, which contained fried mushroom, onion rings, and cheese curds. All of it was very good and fairly priced. I would recommend.", 
      "I really do not like tomatoes in salads but every time I go to seven saints I can't leave without having the BLT salad. It's that good. \u00a0 This is my go to place to take out of town company. It showcases all of the great things Champaign has to offer without the undergrad chaos. I only say four stars instead of five because service is at times slow, but the food is always worth it! There's no need to pass it up unless you're in a hurry.", 
      "While traveling on business to the area, my boss and I went to Seven Saints on the recommendation of some of the local employees. \u00a0It was billed as a good place to get decent food and a good beer. \u00a0Being a fan of any and all microbrews I can get my hands on back home on the east coast I was hopeful that they would have at least some local flavor from which I could sample and some food that was palatable after a long day on a plane and in airports.We got there around 9pm and the place was very quiet (not a bad thing in my mind). \u00a0We grabbed a seat at the bar and I was immediately pleased to see Southern Tier on tap. \u00a0As a large fan of this line of beer back east but only seeing it in bottle my hope grew. \u00a0Along with that some other wonderful names graced the bar taps; Dead guy (again only bottle option for me most times), Fat Tire (a beer that was raved about by my friends after a trip west but I am unable to acquire in my local establishments), and the usual Guiness etc. \u00a0 Add to my excitement was the very well stocked liquor rail with such rarities as Hanger One Vodka (one of the best flavored vodka line) and Lafroaig 30yr (one of my all time favorite scotch brands). \u00a0The bartender was friendly and polite and took our initial beer order. \u00a0After scanning the menu i decided on what was recommended to me, the sliders. \u00a0Since I could not decide and was famished anyways i ordered 6 of the approximately 12 different varieties they offered. \u00a0While waiting for our food I struck up a conversation with our bartender asking for suggestions for good local beers. \u00a0He recommended a wonderful beer made by a small time brewery run by two brothers (the name eludes me at this point) and his recommendation was spot on. \u00a0By this time our food arrived and i dug into the various sliders. \u00a0They were a bit larger then I anticipated but not overly so. \u00a0Most came as described \u00a0and tasted good. No disappointment on the food front. \u00a0After downing my meal and finishing my second beer I asked for one more suggestion. \u00a0At this point the GM of the establishment joined us in the discussion over local breweries and suggested we try Foundry. \u00a0I choose a bourbon barrel aged brew called Backwoods Bastard. \u00a0Alliteration aside it was a wonderful way to end the meal. \u00a0We continued to talk and I was very impressed at the effort both the bartender and the GM himself put in for two random customers on a Monday night when they could have very easily just gone about closing up shop and leaving us to our devices.I have no bad things to say about this place and being a former server/bartender/cook I am not shy about voicing my expectations concerning a locale. \u00a0I would definitely recommend to anyone either passing through the area or local to the area to stop by sometime and try for yourself. \u00a0If the beer list and quality food is not enough of a draw they do offer specials on liquors and beer knocking the price down significantly for that day. \u00a0To fully appreciate this locale I highly recommend going on an off day as I am unsure how a busy saturday night would translate into appreciation for a simple yet enjoyable experience.", 
      "Summer in Champaign is ALL about outdoor seating. This great new restaurant has got it right. With plenty of space out and inside, and self-seating, the atmosphere is always semi-casual and always welcoming. After looking at the menu, we expected an average dining experience, based on the fact that the menu accentuates burgers (they call their mini-burgers SLIDERS) and salads...not our usual dining-out fare.However...the wings are the BEST WINGS we have ever had in our lives. They are not your usual buffalo-drowned bits of suspiciously massive chook, these are fine specimens of realistically-sized, expertly-cooked bird, served crispy with your choice of two sauces, (there are lots to choose...from BBQ to Thai Peanut and beyond).In ordering, we found that each ordering the Slider/Salad combo worked really well, although sharing sliders and tasting different flavors also works well. There is an extensive beer/wine selection, including some fashionable Spanish options, however we seriously question a wine list without a single New Zealand option, especially in the Sauvignon Blanc section. Our favorite sliders so far have included the Buffalo Chicken, the BlackJack, the California Turkey and the Salmon, although we highly recommend asking for NO BUTTER on the buns if you are interested in 'eating lightly'. Our two salads (Goat Cheese and Spinach/Fried Chicken Salad) were both surprisingly delicious, after so many below-average iceberg salads in the mid-west.All in all, we think they have found a niche targeting people who appreciate casual dining prepared exceptionally well. This is the PERFECT OPTION for those diners who want a home-town up-scale alternative to Ruby Tuesday, Steak n Shake, Fridays, or perhaps even Guido's at the same price and not at the mall!Expect to spend $30 on food for 2 courses for 2 people.", 
      "I absolutely love Seven Saints! \u00a0Andy is fantastic and always around to give advice on drinks and ensure the experience is as great as possible. \u00a0The waitstaff is EXTREMELY knowledgable on different liquors and beer. \u00a0They are particularly helpful on whiskey and beer, but more than adequate on just about anything else as well. \u00a0The only negative thing I can say is they have changed my thoughts on what to expect out of waitstaff, and I have found many other bars/restaurants lacking.The drink list is huge, and new things are constantly being added. \u00a0Its very common for there to be a few \"off the list\" specials, particularly on Wednesday nights. \u00a0Wednesdays are a great night to go since 1/4 of the whiskey is half off that night in rotation. \u00a0I have tasted a ton of different whiskeys I never would have tried if it wasn't for this night. \u00a0The waitstaff is always glad to recommend something new based off your criteria, and I have ended up purchasing several bottles from my home bar after trying them at Seven Saints.The food is good, and always comes out quick. \u00a0I am particularly fond of the cheese curds, waffle fries, and sweet potato fries. \u00a0Most sandwiches are sliders, so don't expect a large sandwich. \u00a0They have a deal where you can split soup, salad, and a slider for a good price, that's normally what I choose. \u00a0Their caesar salad is great!", 
      "This place is just wonderful. \u00a0Even though the bar is usually packed, the service and the wait staff are always friendly. \u00a0Andy, the GM, is always around and making sure everyone is happy and enjoying themselves. \u00a0If there ever was a problem, he'd do whatever it takes to make it right. \u00a0The food is excellent and the bartenders really know their stuff about drinks and they make wonderful recommendations. \u00a0I highly suggest visiting on Wednesday nights for their Whiskey Wednesdays. \u00a0I really recommended this bar because of its atmosphere, service, and quality drinks/food.", 
      "I went here for my birthday dinner upon recommendation from a friend. I agree with a previous reviewer, the ambiance of this place has a restaurant chain feel. The crowd was what looked like a mix of graduate students and older couples.Seven Saints is known for their sliders, these mini burgers, kinda like what White Castle serves. The sliders are about $3 to $4 bucks each so it's perfect for ordering a slew of them. I ordered fried cheese curds \u00a0for appetizers which were delicious though a little soggy (then again, anything fried pretty much tastes good). There are plenty of vegetarian options. Any slider can be replaced with a boca burger (50 cents extra), but in my opinion a boca burger patty overwhelms any other taste. So what you end up with is pretty same tasting burgers - my boca blackjack cheese slider tasted like my Asian one. The waffle fries were especially good though (better than The Office's ones in Urbana IMO). The beer selection is limited so this place is decent to take group for dinner - there are better bar options for drinks elsewhere. The service was adequate and attentive, but not overly so. What's with the Third Eye Blind love? There were like 3 TEB songs that played that night :S There's also some outdoor seating. I could definitely image coming back here for lunch.I also like the fact that Seven Saints is directly across from the bus/train station (who needs to spend 10 bucks on a cab when there's convenient public transportation nearby? My friends rode their bikes here and took a bus back home (they have racks on the front of the bus to load bikes).All in all, Seven Saints is a decent option for lunch and dinner, but you can find better spirits elsewhere (i.e. Blind Pig, others)", 
      "Gone down hill. I used to love their sliders and salads, but the service here is atrocious. The latest time I tried to go, we sat down and proceeded to be ignored for 30 minutes even as the servers saw us. Finally someone said they would get to us, but 10 minutes later, we just left. Oh, and this was a Monday night. It's worse on weekends.", 
      "My first visit to Seven Saints got off to a slow start. We asked to be seated outdoors,the weather was nice and their curbside tables are nice. Well we sat for 20 min and no waitress. There were three outside but no one stopped at our table. I finally stopped the young man at the front door and he quickly found us someone to take our order. Hey everybody has an off night! My husband and I enjoy not the run of the mill beers and we were surprised to find extensive selection at seven saints. Goose island 312 for me and fat tire for my spouse.We started our dinner off with fried cheese curds. The cheese curds were golden brown and not greasy,they come highly recommended!We each ordered 2 sliders and a side of waffle fries. I had Asian and smoked BBQ slider and Doug ordered BBQ and California turkey slider. All were cooked to perfection and delicious . They have several options when it comes to the menu so I feel there is something for everyone. All in all we had a wonderful dining experience and our waitress( once we got one) was on the ball and friendly. We will be returning and I would recommend Seven Saints to our friends.", 
      "Used to frequent this place, but the last few times I have been here, the food has been awful. \u00a0The bar is decent... but with all of those bottles, one would think the drink menu would be more expansive. \u00a0Best time to go is when you can sit outside. \u00a0However, that is less than a 3 month window... and outside of it, the ambiance is as cold as the weather. Great location. \u00a0Make better use of it.", 
      "Very nice option for nicer 'bar food' in the C-U area. Great place to go for lunch or a casual dinner. The food is solid and the service was great.", 
      "This bar is a specialized whisky joint. I don't drink whisky but their selection for cheap to high end whisky is substantial. I typically came here on a date with the wife when she visited me during graduate school. We had to live separately for two years but enjoyed our evenings here before her flight home out of CMI. Although it's a whisky bar, they had an interesting selection of wine and beer. I always got the Mojo IPA and she got her Riesling. Aside from the relationship, this is also where I came to prefunk with the roommate before our Thursday night pubcrawls with the School of LER. Initially, my first roommate introduced me to this place when I first arrived to Champaign. We were paired by Burnham's roommate matching system. He was this smart computer science whiz. We drank here on weekends. He moved on to work for Skype. My second roommate was a Korean born Mexican. He was fluent in Spanish which culturally, he loved whisky. I think I was appointed as his wingman because he was this strange kimchee taco hybrid that was soaked in whisky that came off as a creeper. The Chinese Beijing girls loved him though and our strategies to get him laid all started here at Seven Saints. The irony is that, there was nothing Saint like going on at this establishment when we were there.", 
      "I enjoy going to Seven Saints when other bars can be so crowded, especially on the weekends. The service is usually (but not always) friendly, with a good wine and beer selection. The food can be pretty \"meh.\" I've tried their appetizers, salads, sliders, and desserts and nothing has blown me away. What really wins me over is how chill it usually is in there, and the layout, furniture, atmosphere of the interior. I recommend it, especially if you're not interested in a crazy night on the town.", 
      "I definitely love this place. The food is amazing, no matter if you get a salad or a slider, or both! The service is always friendly and food never takes to long. I plan on coming here a lot more often now that I'm 21 and can actually drink with my meal.", 
      "Probably my favorite place to go to get some well-priced and delicious food on a night out. It's also the place I recommend when people from out of town ask where they should go for dinner. The service there is very friendly and prompt, and the food is good. I've never had the salmon burgers, but I wouldn't expect the fish dishes to be the best in the heart of Central Illinois anyway. The Buffalo Chicken Slider and Classic Slider with Cheese are my favorites, along with a side of waffle fries (although if you're a fan of sweet potato fries, they have the best in town). The chipotle ranch sauce that comes with the onion rings is amazing, the tomato bisque is absolutely out of this world and they have a great selection of whiskey and beer at the bar. I really think of this place as more of a restaurant than a bar though. They tend to get busy on Friday and Saturday nights, and if the wait is long, make sure you're back earlier than you think if you decide to walk around the area. Definitely one of the gems in Champaign-Urbana and a place that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good meal at a decent price.", 
      "the service has always been good when i've been there. \u00a0i even once walked there with my husband and our young son in a stroller. \u00a0they were awesome enough to accommodate our larger than life stroller in another room while we dined with our progeny. \u00a0no dirty looks about the baby stroller. \u00a0just awesomeness as they stowed it away in another room. \u00a0that gets a star all by itself.the beer selection is top notch, so if you're into that.... you're covered. \u00a0if you like cheese products deep fried and dipped in crazy fattening ranch dressing... you're also in luck. \u00a0apparently it's great. \u00a0i've never eaten it, but i've heard tell. \u00a0the sliders are okay. \u00a0not great. \u00a0not bad. \u00a0just okay. \u00a0i get the vegetarian burger. \u00a0it's... meh. \u00a0i can heat up a griller patty in the microwave at home and put it on a tiny bun for all of about $1.25. \u00a0i understand that businesses have to make money, but at least make me feel like i'm getting something new and exciting for the price.this place would get a solid two stars from me if not for the amazing.... decadent... brown sugar oatmeal cake. \u00a0i don't eat sugar often... but when i do... it's this place for THAT cake. \u00a0holy hell. \u00a0it's terrible for you, and it's worth every penny.", 
      "The food here was ok. \u00a0The cheese curds were awesome. \u00a0The batter on them are light and the cheese itself is a big hunk. \u00a0I ordered the black and blue salad which was ok. \u00a0I was expecting a variety of greens but it was just lettuce. \u00a0The sweet potato fries were excellent. Service was good, fast and friendly. \u00a0I'd go back for the fries and cheese curds.", 
      "Seven Saints is, hands down, my favorite place to go in Champaign. It has the perfect atmosphere to enjoy a night, with great food (esp. the buffalo chicken sliders and cheese curds!), an amazing spirits list with tons of awesome and very very affordably priced, whiskies, and a relaxed, comfortable feel. Andy is an exceptional general manager who takes clear interest in creating a positive personal experience for the customers, and the service is exceptional. That's not even to mention the AMAZING 50% off whiskeys every Wednesday night :) I can't say enough about how great this place is!", 
      "I have eaten here a few times and never been overly impressed with this place. Last night, I ate here and ordered the Tomato and Pesto grilled cheese. \u00a0Huge mistake. \u00a0My grilled cheese came out with one slice of hard, dried to the bread, cheese on two huge pieces of Texas toast. \u00a0It was so dry I had to ask for marinara sauce to dip it in just to choke it down. \u00a0So not worth it- flavorless and disgusting. \u00a0Kinda like how I feel about everything else I have ordered there. \u00a0OK for drinks, but avoid the food. Oh, and don't bother complaining to the GM, Andy. \u00a0He could care less. Way to keep customers.", 
      "The sliders are good, and they have decent selection of draft beers (including Rogue Dead Guy!). \u00a0The asian slider is average, because the wasabi mayo could have used a little more of the wasabi. \u00a0The smokey bacon cheese slider was awesome for a person who likes to be kicked in the teeth with flavor: \u00a0crispy bacon, smokey BBQ sauce, smoked cheddar.My wife ordered the coup de grace: the tropical slider with grilled pineapple and thai peanut sauce. \u00a0Since you might order 2 or 3 sliders anyway, this one is well worth trying!", 
      "I had a great time here last night. Good food, fun atmosphere. It was Guy Fawkes night. I had no idea what that was, so it was fun to learn about it and see people wearing masks.", 
      "The note I left to myself after the first time I went here was: Sliders and weird salads- melted cheese. \u00a0To you all, that should mean \"They are known for sliders. \u00a0My salad was slathered in melted cheese, which I found odd.\" \u00a0I'm not a midwesterner, so pardon my ignorance, but is this a thing? \u00a0The good thing is that a slider and a salad is a reasonable lunch. \u00a0This is also a good place to take vegetarians because they will substitute a MorningStar veggie burger on any of their sliders. \u00a0It may not be a good place for a vegan. \u00a0People I would take here: \u00a0my BFs parents, who like simple, safe food that looks familiar and is served in an establishment that seems clean. \u00a0Road weary visitors who want to walk, eat, sleep, return to road. \u00a0Westward, ho!", 
      "Good cheese curds!", 
      "I really enjoy going to Seven Saints when I'm in town. They've got a crazy selection of alcohol and at quite reasonable prices (at least the gin). The sliders are quite tasty. I had the salmon one which was definitely good and I also got the BBQ, which was as good as I had it on my previous visit. I believe on my first visit I also got the one with the pineapple and that was kinda wacky but still really tasty!", 
      "The food was good: I ordered a slider, half a salad, and a raspberry iced tea. First off, their servings are TINY compared to the price. Was tempted to get two sliders, but stuck with one, and now am very hungry. Good slider, though. Not greasy, lightly toasted bun, crunchy bacon, and tender burger. The salad I got - country fried chicken - was AMAZING. Their honey mustard dressing is light and tangy. I loved the many julienned red onion and cucumber and half cherry tomaotes! By far my favorite part of the meal. Now. The iced tea. Nuh-uh. Is NOT raspberry flavored. Very small cup for the price.I stole my sister's sweet potato fries and eh... Guido's has better. Seven Saint's fries are overly crunchy and weirdly shaped.My friend said the beer selection, though large, didn't have what he really wanted. Also, he said the Seven Saint's salad is a little...offputting. The lime and nut and fruit combo did not a salad make.The actual restaurant was pretty nice. Clean tables. The barstools weren't uncomfortably high. The service was nice, but slow. The server forgot my friend's beer, and was late with the drinks, but was very cheerful and helpful. My sister said the bathrooms were passable.Probably will come back, but will remember to get at least two sliders and a dinner-sized salad.", 
      "I give it 3 stars, not because of its products or service, but because of its prices. I live in the east coast and have been to plenty of nice places that are much better and charge about the same for drinks and food - but this is not NYC or Philly, so come on! I have also been to many places in the Savoy/Champaign/Urbana area and there are other installments, as nice as this one, that charge a more reasonable fee for drinks. Other than that, I like the staff and the food, specially the sliders and a steak salad they have. It would be nice if they had a live band once a week.", 
      "As close to a nice night out as you can find in CU.The food's always been solid, the drinks good and the service ok.However, it does get VERY noisy during the dinner hour. \u00a0While it may not be a true 5 star, for CU it deserves it.By the way, why does a city with such a strong mixed population have such a terrible restaurant scene?? \u00a0Will there ever be any NICE restaurants?", 
      "I went here with a couple of friends on a friday evening. The atmosphere was pretty casual; it had a pretty urban feel in the downtown Champaign area. As a college student, it was nice because it is also right off the bus station stop. Their specialty is supposedly their 'sliders' and we all got the \"Triple S combo platter.\"All in all, the sliders were pretty good with a pretty good price range. By the second slider though (I got the Smokey BBQ Slider and California Turkey Slider), my taste buds got pretty bored. Even though the sliders have different 'flavors,' the meat and bacon were pretty uniformly made (they did not ask us how we would like our meat cooked). However, my friend strongly recommended the tomato bisque. I also like the medium cut sweet potato fries (if you're into that)!", 
      "Everyone knows this place is known for their sliders, and they are certainly worth a try. \u00a0I liked them enough to go back a few times while living in the area, and always had a good service and good food. \u00a0Never tried anything outside of the sliders.", 
      "My husband and I ate dinner here tonight. \u00a0The sliders were great.....the onion rings were greasy and tasteless. \u00a0 Service was excellent (but we arrived at the off-time of 4:30). \u00a0We would definitely stop here again for a quick bite to eat after work!", 
      "The food is good, but not great. However, the tomato bisque soup is available daily, and it is absolutely fabulous.", 
      "Ate here Saturday evening, 12/10/11 for dinner with my girlfriend. \u00a0Ordered the Cheese Curds as an appetizer, my gf ordered the Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese and I had the Ribeye Steak sandwich. \u00a0We both had two drinks with our dinner...Cheese curds came before the meal and they turned out to be pretty good. \u00a0Nothing to rave about, but average. \u00a0At last, our meal was delivered. \u00a0The bun for my Ribeye sandwich turned out to be what looked like Texas toast. \u00a0As I peeled back the bread to look at my sandwich, I was in for a huge let down! \u00a0This was the absolute worst excuse for a ribeye steak sandwich. \u00a0My biggest complaint, it was paper thin! \u00a0PAPER THIN!!! \u00a0Literately speaking, my steak was no thicker than a cardboard coaster. \u00a0The price tag on this steak sandwich was $10. \u00a0This is my biggest pet peeves when it comes to steak sandwiches...I don't mind paying upwards of $15 for a steak sandwich, but I expect good quality! \u00a0 This was such a poor excuse for ribeye, I had to eat it with the top piece of toast off, just to taste the meat. \u00a0How dare they insult their customers with such a poor excuse for a steak sandwich! \u00a0My gf equally hated her grilled cheese for reasons she will explain in her own review.Once the check arrived, ($52) we asked to speak with the manager. \u00a0We both expressed our concerns with Andy, the manager. \u00a0We felt like after spending $50, we should leave the restaurant full and satisfied. \u00a0Instead, we were leaving hungry, miserable, and downright insulted! \u00a0Andy rattled off various reason as to why my steak might have been a little on the thin side. \u00a0He apologized for the size of the steak, and offered us 2 free drinks to make up for our poor experience. \u00a0REALLY??? \u00a0We spent over $50 and all he was going to do was give us two free drinks? \u00a0No thanks! \u00a0We refused the free drinks, and made sure he knew he just lost two customers for good.I'm not looking for a handout! \u00a0I'm not looking for my money back...but the way he handled our situation was horrible! \u00a0If a customer spends $50 in your restaurant and absolutely hated the food, two drinks is not enough to make up for this! \u00a0I expected a credit or a gift card to come back and give Seven Saints another chance. \u00a0Now, I will never be back! \u00a0I can find steak sandwiches comparable to the one I had at Seven Saints at Taffies or Steak n Shake! \u00a0Keep your two free drinks! \u00a0Just know we will spread the word to anyone who will listen! \u00a0I hope you handle future situations better.", 
      "Sliders are served VERY well done (bordering on burnt) -- despite the fact that I ordered them medium rare. \u00a0This is the second time I've tried their sliders and they've come out this way. \u00a0With that said, they have a great beer selection, \u00a0but I won't be going back for the food.", 
      "We prolly should have come in a lot earlier. \u00a0First available table was right by the door. \u00a0It was pretty cold the whole time we ate. \u00a0Food was great but since it was so busy our wait service wasn't that great. I'd definitely still come here again but this time was so-so.", 
      "Worth eating here but not exceptional. I am a poor person so restaurants that are *slightly* more expensive have to be worth the extra cash for the marginal improvement of food quality. I can't say spending more money was worth it to me. Ok bar to drink at.", 
      "Love it. The food is good, the service is GREAT. I just love this place!!!! SLIDERS ALL THE WAY!!"

      "If thin crust is your thing, this place is hard to beat. You have a huge selection of sauces and toppings, so go ham if you like. I think I tried tomato, kalamata olives, feta, pesto and chicken when I went. wise choice, it was perfection. However, I think it's pretty hard to go wrong at Jupiter's.The locale seems driven towards sports fans and the nocturnal crowd, filled with pool tables, an extensive bar and flat screen TVs everywhere. We see families there quite often though, and I'm sure you can order out. If not, possibly pick up?If you're judging in terms of flavor and thin crust crisp, Jupiter's is the way to go in Champaign.", 
      "Came here after a wedding reception, in need of some grub.We ordered the Pizza Margherita - red sauce, mozzarella & provolone, sliced roma tomatoes, oregano & basil. \u00a0It was fairly tasty. \u00a0Not destination dining at all, but if you're looking for grub to enjoy with a beer, this will hit the spot.Despite the chalkboard announcing that large pizzas were $10 after 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, the waitress tried to stick us with the regular price. \u00a0She seemed annoyed I brought this up. \u00a0Check that bill, people.It's pretty loud, people are playing pool and I saw a man so drunk in the men's room, he was stumbling and slamming into the walls face-first. \u00a0So that's your atmosphere.I'd go back if I were looking for a late night bite, but there are probably better options out there.", 
      "A very consistant pool bar with great pizza. My family loved the atmosphere, design, food, and staff. You get exactly what you can expect, that's 5 stars in my book.", 
      "Be forewarned. It's cracker crust pizza. My thinking on this is, I'd rather go to the supermarket, buy a box of matzoh, and spread a little sauce and cheese on it than pay big bucks for cracker pizza. But of course, this also sounds like a pretty horrible idea. But if you like cracker crust pizza... No, actually, I'm not going to say this is passable for cracker crust pizza. I have no idea what's good about this. Oh, doesn't Lunchables do a a pizza lunch? There you go, it's kind of like that.So, really what I'm saying is, I guess a lot of people like crunchy pizza, but if you're not one of those people, don't bother.", 
      "Was downtown this past weekend, looking to go to Seven Saints, but they had like a 30 min wait so stumbled into this restaurant. I went to the other one back in my college days, but this one I didn't even know existed. Walked in and it's seat yourself tables to the left, a bunch of pool tables to the front, and a long bar in the middle. Very limited seating, but it wasn't packed at all so that wasn't a problem. There was a weird draft hitting our table though, so we moved to one deeper in the corner since we thought it was the door, but the draft was there too. We just had to wear our coats throughout dinner.For 6 people, we ordered 2 large pizzas, one buffalo chicken, and one prosciutto. I didn't care much for the prosciutto, but the buffalo was pretty bomb. Ordered some small ranches (50 cents per though, what a rip) and it was delicious. It's deceptive that they cut their pizzas into smaller squares because you feel like you can eat so much more. We had 6 slices left over and it was about 42-ish dollars with tax and tip. So a large probably feeds 4 people comfortably, 3 uncomfortably.Weird thing though is when we asked for a box, the waitress asked if we wanted anything else. We said no and assumed she would bring us the check. But didn't and we sat there for like 10 more minutes. Had to grab her attention and then ask for the check. We weren't drinking or anything so I'm not sure why she thought we would want to just hang out. Minor inconvenience though so it's whatever.", 
      "Yes. \u00a0You win, Jupiters. \u00a0Happy hour special providing me with cheap yet delicious beer? \u00a0Check.Super cheap pizza, making life amazing? \u00a0Double check.Okay, Jupiter's has happy hour specials that are WONDROUS. \u00a0I got a magnificent large pizza for only $8. \u00a0And it was huuuuge. \u00a0How huge? \u00a0It was so big I ate \u00a0leftovers for lunch, dinner and another lunch during the week. \u00a0For eight dollars!Jupiters, I will sing your praises on the harp, lyre, and xylophone. \u00a0Seriously.", 
      "I'd heard it was the best (thin crust) pizza in town, so I checked it out, and I'd say it lived up to my expectations.I went with a big group of friends, and we ordered the Special K pizza (sausage, mushrooms, cream sauce, some other stuff... no drugs or cereal though) and the Pizza Bianca (olive oil, artichokes, onions, other vegetables). Both were great, though the Bianca needed the parmesan cheese I added on top for saltiness. I'd like to go back and try the plain cheese (after all, that's what I usually get and judge pizza places by), and the smoked salmon pizza just sounds too interesting to pass up!", 
      "Jupiter's Pizza is awesome. A place where you can swap your favorite pizza toppings with friends, enjoy your go-to beer on the side, chat with friends, and watch the basketball game on their large TVs. They also have pool tables and arcade games. My favorite night to go is Tuesday because they have half off large pizzas and it's a popular night to go. Warning to Chicago-native-deep-dish lovers: these pizzas are thin-crust pizzas and I'm from St. Louis, so we love thin crust pizzas, but this place does not rip you off on toppings. Jupiter's specialty pizzas are great! \u00a0There's no need to stress about perfecting your pizzas toppings since they already have specialty pizzas with your already-favorite toppings. If you want to make your own crazy masterpiece, you can customize your pizza with four toppings maximum (meat toppings count as two). More importantly, the price is very reasonable. Also this place has a clean, friendly, fun atmosphere. It's definitely one of my favorite places to go in downtown champaign. I recommend every U of I student to check this place out with friends there before graduation .", 
      "When CU goes smoke free in January I fully expect myself to go to Jupiter's like 100 times a month. \u00a0Although I don't really like thin crust pizza, for some reason the Jupiter's topping combinations always hit me just right. \u00a0Especially the pizzas with meat on them. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0Meat Pizza.I wish there were more seating, so I could bring more massive groups with me. \u00a0Jupiter's is an extremely popular departmental happy hour site, and when even 20 of us show up we pretty much fill up all the seating in the entire bar.Pizza is good, beer is good, not too loud, lots of pool tables, very few skanks!", 
      "Nothing like coming back to my old alma matter and hitting up parts of town that I never went to. Jupiters is in that part of town.As I sat there, you would see the staff flying all around the place taking care of customers and never just hanging out. Our drinks were refreshed quickly, the pizza we ordered was hot, and I got to hang out with my old friend and not have to yell above bad music.", 
      "There is better pizza to be had, and there are places with better beer selections. There is no place in Champaign-Urbana with a better beer selection that also serves pizza, though, and the pizza is not half bad, if you like your crust cracker-thin and crisp. I like the smoked salmon. I was very sad on my recent visit home to find that Bell's no longer distributes in Illinois. That is tragic. You can still get Lindeman's on draft though; I'm not sure you can even get that at the Blind Pig. I can't wait to go home again now that C-U is smoke-free. I will be able to enjoy this place at times other than 2 PM when there are actually other humans there.", 
      "I like this place. I have gone multiple times for pizza around dinner and a couple times to play pool later in the evening. Go on tuesdays after 8pm-- half price pizza makes it totally worth it. The Pizza Preferito is one of the best mix of toppings I've ever had, and all the other varieties I've tried have been good too. My one complaint is that it wasn't very full when we went-- there was a creepy old guy watching us play pool and it was a bit weird.", 
      "Another institution in downtown Champaign that has been here forever. \u00a0The bar area is nice with a few tables and big booths. \u00a0There is not a lot of sitting area if you come at peak hours. \u00a0So be warned. \u00a0Great billiard tables that go the length of this great old building, and people are serious about their pool here. \u00a0There is even a patio out back. \u00a0The building itself is ancient, and tons of character.The servers work hard, and are very friendly. \u00a0Though can get swamped during peak hours. \u00a0Just a couple of decent beers on tap. \u00a0Usually an offering from Bells, or Summit, and just recently I noticed Lagunitas. \u00a0The pizzas are great. \u00a0Crispy, thin crust that is awesome. \u00a0The specialty pizzas like Pizza Pesto is great. \u00a0Can't go wrong making your own as well. \u00a0They come in personal, 14\", and 16.\" \u00a0Always a good stop downtown for pizza, beer, and fun.", 
      "Amazing thin crust pizza! \u00a0We moved to CA and cannot find anything even close! \u00a0Good salty meats and delicious sauce!", 
      "I used to go to Jupiter's more but now I frequent other bars. \u00a0I think it has pretty good thin crust pizza. Make your own or choose one of their signature pizzas. \u00a0They are good for pool and drinks. \u00a0Good service though... waitress comes around all the time.I think people empty out near midnight on the weekends.. so I don't like that so much.", 
      "Jupiters is great! Really great thin-crust pizza, (Italia would be proud) awesome sophisticated toppings (my fav is the Prosciutto and Artichoke...YUM!). The only downside for me (hence not 5 stars) is the small number of outside tables, BUT I have always been able to sit outside. I reckon it would be cooler if there was more of an outside 'vibe' there, especially being a block out of the way from the other downtown restaurants... I am still a fan.", 
      "Ever since Amandos Pizza on Philo road closed there has been a lack of decent places to go. Last night we thought we'd try Jupiter's. The big-screen TVs are prevalent and made watching the game easy. There are plenty of billiards tables in the summer when the students are gone. The pizza however was only okay. Thin crust, w a passable amount of toppings but no discernible signature taste or style. We also had a salad which was supposed to be Greek but didn't really measure up (no cucumbers, no onions). We'd go back but mostly due to the lack of quality pizza places in town.", 
      "2 things I love. Good pizza and billiards. And this place has both. Jupiter's is a great place if you want to unwind from a busy week or simply...you need something to get your mind off an exam. Overall, this place gets a 4/5 from me purely because it doesn't have what it takes to get that 5/5 rating but doesn't settle for anything less than a 4/5.", 
      "I love Jupiter's pizza. Lots of different excellent combinations available.Lots of good drinks to be had. (Bell's!)Lots of pool to be played.Why not 5 stars? Every time I go the service is horrendous. Absolutely terrible. Not because the server is inherently bad at what he/she does but the place is understaffed and our server was most likely a bit overwhelmed.", 
      "A really, really good sit-down pizza place, and so much better than Papa Dels (that's sacrilege in C-U, but it's the truth). The thin-crust pizza is fantastic, and reasonably priced. My girlfriend and I normally order either a pineapple pepperoni or a bacon pepperoni (sometimes half-and-half) and it's fantastic. I also love the atmosphere; I don't play pool, but the building is gorgeous (I'm a sucker for the tin roof) and the place is lively. The garlic bread isn't really worth it, and the beer selection is kind of lame (all the domestic Big Three bottles you can drink!), which keeps it from five stars, but I like Jupiter's a lot.", 
      "Pool tables galore!Good thin crust pizza's.Daily drink specials (and the beer is always cheap).Lots of seating.Moreso pool hall than sports bar, so not a lot of flat screens around.Nice waitstaff.Any questions?", 
      "Really like the pizza, really like the beer selection, don't love the sitting situation or the pool tables. It's too small to be able to really play. Go to Jupiter's II if you really want to be able to play pool. Come here for some pizza before and after a night of drinking.To this day it is the only bar my friends have ever been kicked out of for being too loud. It was a Saturday night and we were kicked out of a bar for being too loud.", 
      "It's a delicious place to begin or end a bar run in the downtown Champaign area. \u00a0They have fantastic pizzas and drinks, with great seating. \u00a0It's very spacious and the wait staff is usually very friendly.I never thought I'd say this, but I love BBQ chicken pizza, and I only have Jupiters to blame.", 
      "Had a fantastic late Saturday evening here. \u00a0After 10pm, a large two topping pizza is $10. \u00a0This allowed me to get a large smoked salmon pizza for $10. \u00a0While it might not sound like a great combination, this pizza was fantastic. \u00a0I expected skimpy or shredded salmon, but received fairly large pieces strewn across the pizza generously. \u00a0Drinks weren't expensive, and overall there was a good selection. \u00a0A $4.50 Lindeman's Framboise is about $1.50 cheaper than the equivalent size at the Blind Pig, if that gives you an idea of the pricing. \u00a0I can't wait to go again, fantastic pizza and reasonable drinks.", 
      "The Pranzo mustard-cream based thin-crust pizza is pretty unique and the reason I keep coming back. Awesome. There's always a few decent craft beers on tap, although this is a place where you learn from experience the printed menu tap list usually isn't accurate. :(The service is always a little hit and miss--it'd be nice if the wait staff knew the beers better and had a better sense of timing (waiting for the check seems normal). But staff are usually friendly. For a place to get a chill dinner downtown, I'm a fan regardless of its shortcomings.", 
      "I would have given Jupiter's 4 or 5 stars for the pizza. But they probably have the rudest waitress in Champaign. The other Jupiters location is much better as a restaurant. If you want a drink or play pool, then it would get 5/5.", 
      "I sort of feel like an outcast since the reviews for this place are generally flowering, but I really dislike the pizza. \u00a0To each their own I suppose, but quite frankly, it's probably my least favorite pizza around. \u00a0Pizza is way overpriced. A small personal 9\" pizza costs about $8, and I equate the taste to that of your microwaveable pizza bites. If you like pizza bites, well heck, then dig in. Their pizza to me is just like saltine crackers with mediocre sauce and stale cheese. Not only that, but food takes forever to come out.I get drug to this place with co-workers every now and then, and our small 9\" pizzas take 45 minutes to come out... That's ridiculous considering a pizza like this should cook in about 6 minutes.... On a plus note though, the servers are great and the atmosphere is nice, but ultimately I go out to eat for good food, and Jupiter's does not deliver.", 
      "This is the 2nd time I had to post a review of Jupiters. Yelp took it down, though I have no idea why. \u00a0I wish we had a Jupiters or equivalent in California. My favorite is their sausage, schroom, bell pepper and onion pizza. They manage to deliver a wonderful, thin crust pizza that's not too greasy, but oh-so-tasty. \u00a0I hope Yelp doesn't take this review down this time.", 
      "This place is great. First, I love their new location because it has an entire basement area with arcade games, mini bowling arenas, and pool tables. It makes it a great restaurant to bring anyone - friends, family, and all ages. I have come here different times with different groups of different sizes. Every single time, they were very accomodating, fast, and nice. I once came there having reserved a dinner spot about 2 hours in advance for 30+ people and when we got there they were super prepared!! It was nice having tons of games to play while we were waiting for the food also! Although it is pretty awesome, I give this place 4 stars because besides Tuesday nights (which are half price pizza nights!) the place is pretty pricey for thin crust pizza which is not that filling. Furthermore, it is pretty far from campustown, which makes it hard for a college girl to access!", 
      "Great bar. Pizza is great, thin crust. \u00a0Best Pizza in town IMHO (not a big Papa Dels fan). Beer selection is so-so.", 
      "one of my favorite places in downtown champaign. so much to do, so little time. if you wanna play pool, get there early...tables fill up faast. they have a waiting list at the bar, so make sure you get on it. we had to learn that the hard way. no worries, you have a dart board and a couple other arcade games while waiting.pizzas are solid. hawaiian is my go to. a normal person could easily down two of these bad boys, but i'm quite content with just one.", 
      "Thank goodness the Blind Pig had no room for us and we were able to make a stop at Jupiters. This is a great stop towards the end of the night. Still one of the best pizza places in town. Great place to play pool. And drinks are quickly refreshed since it doesn't get as crowded as some of the other places.", 
      "Good pizza. \u00a0It's thing crust with nice crunch. \u00a0Normally I'm not a thin crust fan but this was surprisingly good. \u00a0The place had a bunch of pool tables which were cool but it limits seating. \u00a0Luckily we got seats at the bar.", 
      "The pizza was pretty good. I thought it was a little expensive, but it was exotic enough to make up for the slightly inflated price.So why two stars? Jupiter's has the second-worst service I've ever had, mostly due to the surliest, most hostile waitresses I've ever interacted with. Just awful. I'll never go back.", 
      "This was always one of my favorite bars in downtown Champaign. \u00a0The pizza is quite good I think, and had a very unique light crackery crust. \u00a0Some of the best thin crust I think I have had. \u00a0Bar is nice and roomy, good place to play pool. \u00a0The bar could get very crowded on weekends though, nothing aproaching green street bars though. \u00a0Nice segueway bar on the transition from \"college\" bar patrion to normal bar patrion. \u00a0Sadly many don't make this transition.", 
      "I always make a stop here whenever I'm in town. A perfect place to grab a bite with an old friend. I'm particular to the smoked salmon and dill pizza, but back in college I used to show much love to the BBQ chicken as well. Tuesday nights - half price large pizzas! Everything here seems cheap compared to my current location of NYC, but I still love a good deal!", 
      "Food, service, and atmosphere of this place are all a huge draw for me here. Probably the best thin crust pizza in town, and a good drink selection, too. Ambiance is great, and sometimes it is just nice to get away from campus restaurants and bars! I would definitely make a trip to Jupiters the next time I'm in 'paign.", 
      "Amaaazing pizza! Some of the best in town, and probably my favorite thin-crust. I think it's better here than at Jupiter's 2 for some reason. Unlike some of the bars downtown, this one also usually has a drink special every night. I also love the pool-hall setup. Overall one of my fav bars in Champaign.", 
      "Great pizza and friendly service. \u00a0The place is plenty big, so it doesn't get too loud.", 
      "I've been here only once as of yet and I loved it! \u00a0I love their pizza menu. \u00a0The combinations are interesting (or you can make your own) and the crust is very good. \u00a0I had a mustard base sauce pizza that was awesome! \u00a0I loved it. \u00a0Nowhere else could I go for this pizza. \u00a0We had three pizzas at the table and I enjoyed all of them very much. \u00a0I think the environment is a lot of fun also. \u00a0The price is fair. \u00a0It's 6.99 for a personal pizza which a good size! \u00a0I'm looking forward to coming back!"

      "AMAZING LUNCH SPECIALS! I've heard both Bombays and Casablanca are both owned by the same people: but Bombay is the place to go for lunch! You and a buddy could get away splitting a dish for $8. Very cool! The food is pretty good. Not the best in town (Casablanca or that new one in Urbana is better), but good enough for a quick lunch.", 
      "I ordered my food online with my credit card at about 6:30 PM. At 8PM, I called Bombay Indian Grill, and asked about the status of my food. I was told that the delivery guy should be picking up soon.Around 9PM, I called again. This time I was told I had to call delivery.com. I tried calling, and no one picks up. Around 9:30PM, I get a call from the delivery person. When I go to take my food, he says, \"you're supposed to pay with cash.\" I explained that I already paid via yelp's link for online delivery with my credit card. He said, \"it says you are paying with cash.\" I proceed to stand there for fifteen minutes, while he calls various people to finally get to the number to call to confirm my method of payment. He says, \"do you have your credit card?\" I respond, \"no.\" He says, \"you'll need it because they're going to want to confirm the payment.\" Mind you, I am in the law building. My stuff is on the other side of the law building. I am not wandering around looking for my credit card, while he calls people to confirm my payment. I just stood there. At one point, I said, just void this I don't want it. Then my hunger snapped me back to my senses. After some time on the phone, he is told I paid with my credit card already. I told him I would not be using their services again, he said \"okay.\" He walked out unaffected. Around 10 PM, I called the number on delivery.com, and heard no apologies. Thanks Bombay Grill, for providing me with the distinct pleasure of paying $23 to have cold mutter paneer and wilted garlic naan delivered to me more than 2.5 hours after I ordered it. The lack of silverware and napkins was a nice touch.Thanks delivery.com, for demonstrating that incompetence and a lack of care is possible at all levels of an organization.", 
      "Restaurant reviewHmm Indian food selection is very limited in Champaign so I was excited to eat at Bombay again since my medical school days. I had only been here once with my wife for dinner and the food was pretty spicy. The lunch special seemed enticing for 7+ dollars depending on what you order. I wish I took a picture of the menu, maybe next time. The chicken curry I ordered took a bit of time to prepare but it came out piping hot. The curry was not spicy at all which was perfect. It was rich and creamy with ample amount of chicken. The naan was simply the largest naan I have ever seen. It was perfect with the curry. You also get a potato pakora. No salad though as mentioned previously. All and all great, but if you could pay a dollar or two more for buffet at someplace else I probably would go with that for variety. The only downside of this place is that they use plastic ware and plates, but I guess this is a college town after all and I have to lower my standards. Pro: large menu with lunch specials, large naan, not too spicy curryCons: plasticware, slow serviceHidden gem: 7+ dollar lunch specials with large naan or rice and potato pakora", 
      "generally okay place, a little overpriced for the settings:( \u00a0noisy and place is too small, not looking very neat... food portion is below average. maybe not again.", 
      "Food was pretty average. \u00a0Waitress was pleasant. \u00a0I ordered the mixed grill. \u00a0It was all chicken. \u00a0Where was the mix that was on the menu?!? \u00a0$15.99 for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain. \u00a0No rice. Burnt naan. \u00a0I will return to Puran in Bloomington:)", 
      "This is the best Indian food you'll find in Urbana-Champaign. \u00a0Growing up in India and spending more than a decade in New Jersey, I have had luxury of trying out Indian food at many places (incl. home!!). \u00a0The taste of the food is authentic, not too spicy, but not at all bland. \u00a0True art of Indian food is to use variety of herbs and spices in a way that it enhances the taste of food, but doesn't dominate the overall taste. Many Indian restaurants either are afraid of using spices or carelessly overdo it. \u00a0 Bombay Grill nails that aspect, so it gets five stars from me. Besides the taste, the food isn't that expensive for an Indian restaurant standard. \u00a0We tried weekday buffet last week. \u00a0For $11 + tip + tax, it had enough varieties. \u00a0Some really good, some right on mediocrity, which is very common with buffet. Their butter chicken and tandoori roast chicken are worth trying. \u00a0Saag paneer is phenomenal for those interested in vegetarian options. \u00a0Lunch buffet had probably the best naan I've tried in many years. \u00a0They are freshly baked and new ones keep coming worm and fluffy from the kitchen. Judging from the buffet food, I can confidently say that a la carte items would be a bang for your buck too!!Next time will try dinner and see if it's equally satisfying as the lunch buffet.", 
      "So good! \u00a0Solid Indian food! \u00a0Lunchtime special cannot be beat! \u00a0Note - it gets busy so be prepared to have to wait if busy meal time.If you are concerned about spice tell them and they will show you the options for non-spicy dishes.", 
      "Best Indian food in Champaign ....From chats to curries, I love it all. My favorites were papdi chat, samosa chat ... but I have tried all appetizers. Chicken saag is just out of world, I love the creamy texture, freshness it has, I have had it in many places, but this place does the best. I miss this place truly.", 
      "Service was fast. \u00a0Prices are very reasonable. \u00a0The food is good by Champaign standards and OK by larger market standards. \u00a0I had the Chicken Vindaloo which had a nice flavor but was lacking in heat. \u00a0The naan was nice but just slightly burnt. \u00a0I would go back if I was in champaign and jonesin for some indian food, but i wouldnt seek it out as a fantastic restaurant", 
      "I LOVE THIS PLACE! Prior to trying out Bombay Indian Grill, I had only tried Indian food once and I absolutely despised it. But when I came down to Champaign I knew I had to give it a second shot and Bombay Indian Grill was the place that stole my heart. Their samosas are crispy and cooked to perfection, their buttery naan is amazing, and their Chicken Makhani was so so good. I wish it was a more spicier dish but it was still delicious with tons of flavor. The waiters are always attentive and friendly - if not too friendly. This place gets busy quickly so go earlier or later than a usual meal time but beware of the 3-5 closing time because I had gone between those times not knowing they closed and I was really disappointed. Learn from my mistake!", 
      "Ordered online and the food came delivered and some spilled out but it was really good!! I just wish it didn't spill out. My only complaint. So driver, easy on them turns!!", 
      "We were on the campus for an event on Saturday and decided to try out this place. The food was awesome, prepared hot. I tried Chicken garlic masala and my wife tried Chicken curry and both were great tasting.Will certainly visit this place next time on the campus.", 
      "This place used to be much better, it really has gone downhill in the past year. Perhaps the best comment I can muster is that it's definitely better than Ambar, which \u00a0is really not saying a whole lot. But if you must have Indian food, and have no possible way of getting to Race St. in Urbana for good Indian food, then I recommend Bombay Grill.", 
      "For my grad program I have to spend a few weeks in Champaign every year. When I'm there, I go to this place all the time. The food is great, and it's really cheap at lunch - for $6.99 you can get an enormous amount of your entree, plus either the biggest piece of naan in history OR a giant pile of rice OR some of both, plus a couple pakoras and a salad. What? Fabulous. And it is more than enough food to last for two meals, which is another huge plus.In case that weren't enough, they frequently give me free stuff. I don't totally understand why. I'm not really a regular, and I'm not a supermodel. If this place were on the east coast, I'd guess it was because I'm polite, but this is Champaign, where everyone says \"please\" and \"thank you\" and smiles. So...I don't really understand it, but every time I go there, I get some of another entree, or an extra piece of naan, or a dessert, or a soda. Maybe everybody gets free stuff. Whatever. I'm not one to look a gift daal in the mouth.", 
      "Totally solid, no-frills Indian food. \u00a0The lunch specials are affordable and come with rice/naan (THE LARGEST PIECE OF NAAN YOU'VE EVER SEEN), salad, and a veggie pakora - for under $10. \u00a0Yes, please!I've only been to the 1st Street location once, but from what I've tasted, the food is basically the same here. \u00a0Creamy chicken tikka masala (my fave, I'm a gringo, I know) with crispy, buttery naan, mmm. \u00a0I tried my boyfriend's Lamb Saag dish and loved it also.Why is the lunch so affordable? \u00a0Because it's a really small place (the tables are tightly-packed in), there's no waiter service, and your meal is served on Styrofoam. \u00a0This is Indian food for poor college students. \u00a0If you want a more relaxed, \"restaurant-y\" atmosphere (and don't mind paying a few extra dollars), head over to the Bombay Grill on 1st. \u00a0But if, like me, you are in grad school and up to your ass in student loan debt, this is the place for you.", 
      "I was a little reluctant to try this place out but after getting a thumbs up from my Indian friend, I finally gave in. It is quite a small place with 20 or less small tables. I was there with 5 other friends and found that it is particularly hard to find a table that was big enough to accommodate all of us, especially during lunch time.I was surprised when I tasted their food because I thought it was gonna be really bad. It turned out to be okay although it wasn't excellent. I love their paneer makhani because the sauce was wonderfully creamy but oddly, the paneer tasted like tofu to me. I also had their lentil curry and briyani rice but that weren't as good. You have a choice of a huge naan or rice for lunch specials I think. I'd go for the NAAN if I were you.Expect to spend at least $7 or $8 for vegetarian dishes and more for meats. For the amount of food that they give, the prices are a little steep in my opinion. It's usually the naan that fills me up, not the curry.Updated 5/10/08:I was there for dinner and I realized that it was a completely different experience in the evening. For lunch, you order your food and pay at the cash register. When the food is ready, they will serve it to you in styrofoam plates and plastic cutleries. For dinner, it becomes a sit-down restaurant with table service, cute waitresses, and food served on china and silverware. A stark difference, eh?", 
      "I absolutely think that Bombay Grill has the best chicken mahkani. \u00a0No restaurants in Chicago (even on Devon) can compare! \u00a0Or maybe I just haven't found that one perfect place in the city yet...So anyways, when I was an undergrad, I luckily lived across the street from Bombay so I would come here all the time. \u00a0The manager knew me by my first name, hahahahha that was embarassing. \u00a0Yes their prices can be a little expensive but I think it's worth it. \u00a0I love their garlic naan too. \u00a0What I hate about all indian restaurants is that everything is always separate--- naan, rice, etc. \u00a0Blah.Anyways, A+ for Bombay!", 
      "This restaurant is a great deal for dinner! For two entrees and an appetizer, the check was about $26, which is pretty good for two people -- and we were stuffed. The food is delicious, the portions are decent, our glasses were always filled with water, and service was prompt.Only two negatives, no liquor license and the atmosphere is a bit lacking. It was a little too loud and a little too crowded, but it's a good place for casual dining.", 
      "I love Bombay Indian Grill. I frequented the Green St. location all throughout my four years of college, and the 1st St. location twice. So far, this is my favorite place for Indian food. Everything is so good, especially the Naan, and the service is really nice. The prices are fantastic and I love the dim-lighting/ambiance during dinner times. I have moved back to the Chicago area since having graduated, and miss the robust and fresh flavors of Bombay. I have not yet been able to find any place back home that meets the high standards of taste, service, and good service like at Bombay.", 
      "I would eat here for lunch every day if I could. \u00a0If only my idiot co-workers would get over their aversion to \"ethnic\" foods. \u00a0Rubes.Don't make the same mistake. \u00a0Even if the closest you normally come to adventurous food is Panda Express, you would like this food.If you eat here, make sure to order the naan. \u00a0It is perfect and HUGE!", 
      "Rock solid Indian food. Lunch menu is cheaper. Mango Lassi has about three different flavors based on what night you go and a lot of the chicken seems to be prepared beforehand. That being said its great. I love the food, not the lamb for some reason, but its hard to think of anything better for the price.", 
      "I think this place is pretty good and affordable. \u00a0It beats the other Indian joint in town. \u00a0The only drawback is that it's not very clean (flies may be buzzing around as you eat) and it's very hot in the summer (their air conditioning sucks). \u00a0So I would not recommend going there on a hot humid day. \u00a0I would also not recommend going there with a large group.. as other reviews have suggested, the place is not big. \u00a0Waiter service ONLY at night.Anyhoo... there are many choices you can make but not all are good. \u00a0I like the chicken mekhani (aka butter chicken) or lamb biryani (aka lamb and fried rice.. but it's delish). \u00a0If you are accustomed to Indian food or want to be more adventurous then I would suggest the saag paneer (spinach and cheese), spinach and chicken dish, eggplant dish (I believe it's called bengan bartha), or gobi aloo (cauliflower and potatoes). \u00a0I'm not a fan of the tandoori chicken.Oh they also have this naan (which is like pita bread) with lamb in it. \u00a0I forgot what it's called but I've tasted it and it's pretty good.Well worth a visit if you want to try something different.", 
      "This Indian restaurant surprised me in how good it was! \u00a0We had several dishes - a Tikka, a Masala, and a Mekhani and all were very flavorful and tasty.The Naan was delicious and enormous! \u00a0We ordered 3 pieces for our party of 3 and only used two. \u00a0Whoops!Service was fine - amusing giving my order at an Indian restaurant to a white teenager, though!", 
      "There is a long standing debate between my friends and I over the best Indian restaurant on Green street. Unlike Chinese food here, there isn't much competition, so it's basically Bombay vs. East and West. East and West is completely vegetarian and leans towards Southern Indian style snacks, whereas Bombay Grill has heartier food \u00a0and has a more formal dinner.I think some of their dishes are a little overspiced, but the Tandoori chicken is absolutely divine with a crisp skin and the perfect amount of seasoning. I only wish it came with more chicken and less of the lentil side and gigantic naan. Don't get me wrong, the naan here is great, but more of that chicken would be better. The service is quite slow and it is pretty expensive, so I reserve going here for when I really need a treat.", 
      "I've been to Bombay Indaian Grill a couple of times now and everything I've had there was delicious. I've gotten the Bengan Bartha (spicy eggplant) and Aloo Gobi (cauliflower with potatoes), both of which were very tasty with a side of naan bread. The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4 is because the food is overpriced: $10 for a small cup of stewed vegetables and naan bread... Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.Overall, I like the food there but because I don't like feeling ripped off, I probably won't come back too often, unless I'm in the vicinity and have an extreme craving for Indian food.", 
      "Tasty food. My favorite was always chicken makhani. Sometimes the manager would give me additional nan (some kind of pita bread but much more tasty) for free. The price is low and you will always end up as full as it gets.Seating was sometimes a problem because the place is kind of small, and it is so good that it gets crowded.I moved away from Chambana to the south west. I have been in some other indian restaurants but no one compares to Bombay Grill regarding taste. I miss it.", 
      "I've eaten Indian all over the state, and this place remains my favorite. The portions are generous, the prices are low, and the food is vibrantly flavorful the way Indian should be. I actually worked here for a summer, and I can honestly say I've never eaten better in my life. All day and all night my stomach was a bubbling cauldron of curry. Try the vegetable vindaloo- I put it on the menu!", 
      "We shared Chicken Aloo Curry which came with rice ($9) and added a side of naan ($2) to go. The place was packed, dimly lit, and casual. The service was quick and the food was flavorful and fresh. It was not too spicy. Menu is standard Indian cuisine. A-OK.", 
      "We love Bombay on Green St! Really delicious Indian food, can't go wrong!", 
      "I have no pretensions to being an expert on Indian fare, but Bombay does what it's supposed to do: fill your belly in a reasonable fashion while remaining tasty. The naan is fluffy and delicious, and any of the chicken dishes (I've tried several), are excellent. \u00a0However, the lunch rush is pretty intense, and the staff make no bones about letting you know that they are not there to indulge in your lunch hour relaxation. \u00a0Expect to see your plates taken away and your table cleaned as a *hint* to mosey on along, partner. \u00a0Seriously, a bit awkward to have my table wiped down in mid-sentence. \u00a0Still, decent food for what it is, a tiny lunch factory in Campus Town.", 
      "Really great Indian food, just a few blocks from campus. For a quick lunch, it's a great amount of excellent food for a good price. Their naan is fresh and flavourful, and they were great at customizing spiciness levels for the various American/Indian palates in our party. A little bit of a small restaurant, their second location on 1st is bigger and features a lunch buffet for the less-adventurous. However, the Green St. location had a variety of great food options, and a Himalayan chicken special that was divine. Great place to meet and catch up, but can get crowded when students/classes are in session.", 
      "Mediocre Indian food. I eat Indian food in almost every town I go to and even had it catered at my wedding so I would consider myself somewhat of an Indian food connoisseur. Having said that, there's not much selection in this town.Samosas chat were flavorful. Our entrees were just okay. I ordered lamb korma which baaarely had a korma taste. To be honest, I forgot that that was the dish I was eating. The curry was very thin. I don't remember what my husband ordered but its flavor was very heavy on the tomato. Like a tomato soup almost. The lamb itself was delicious, but the overall dish was borderline disappointing. They didn't offer spice levels on the food. It wasn't bland per se, but it was more like amateur night than the real deal. The best part of the meal was the appetizer and the naan. It was reasonably priced though.It was also super noisy. Don't know if I'll go back, but I had to try it for myself to see if it was any good.", 
      "Well, the first week I went here somehow I ended up going three times. I really like the food here. I wouldn't say I'm a connoisseur of Indian food, but it tastes really good to me, and they really do give you a ton. I had the biryani the other day and I was able to eat it for three more meals. The only complaint I might have is that it's a little expensive. (I'd rather have less food and pay less money) Also, I love really spicy food. I've learned my lesson in the past--don't tell Indian or Thai restaurants that you want the food spicy or you might not be able to eat for a week. But I feel like the food here is just not that hot. One exception was this one appetizer...it had big old chunks of jalapeno. Pretty tasty! I'd love to come back.", 
      "This restaurant is dam costly and is not at all worth for the food they serve. I am Vegan and Paid $13.2 for just 3 types of sides and naan bread and custard. Food was ot worth more than $6 however we were shocked to see their heavy check. Food is not so tasty to admire. It doesnt have the true authentic Indian food taste. They make sides of potatoes and green peas which are cheap in market to keep their profit margin high. They are smart enough to rob people. Please try other Indian restaurant who give you many option to eat for less than $10.", 
      "This place makes no qualms about itself. It is a solid Punjabi joint, creamy curries, paneer and all. \u00a0That said, it's rather lacking in spicy inspiration - both locations didn't feature any sort of kick to their curries. \u00a0However, the lunch special is all bang for your buck...I recently went here on a lunch meeting and my professor and I were able to split one plate and leave completely stuffed! \u00a0I'm glad the only real traditional Punjabi Indian joint in C-U isn't a disaster, but it's nothing to write home about either!", 
      "If you are a female and like to be gawked at, I recommend this place for you. The staff stare like they have never seen a woman before. Also, if you like black hair as a garnish in your chicken makhani, you'll really enjoy it here. Disgusting. Threw out a $10 plate of food after finding hair. Not to mention when brought to the attention of the staff, there was no apology or anything to fix it.", 
      "I reviewed this in 2009 to let people know that I got food poisoning here. I ate here again and am rating it more highly cause I ate the veg food and it was fine, but mostly because I highly approve of the quantity and quality of their rice. \u00a0Working class Asian Americans like myself love their rice and this place is super generous and the quality is very very good. Better than the entree itself in fact.", 
      "This restaurant was good, fine, but I wasn't particularly impressed. \u00a0Ordered vegetable vindaloo. \u00a0The place lacks any ambiance, though it does have a nice view of Green Street. \u00a0The naan is very good.", 
      "Food is always fast and fresh here. And I've noticed the naan has gotten considerably larger since I last set foot in here in early 2007. But I'm not complaining!", 
      "This place has a great variety of food! Go here for lunch! The portion is bigger and it's cheaper. You get a salad and a small appetizer with your entree during lunch, but you have to pay for it during dinner. The naan here is absolutely to die for. the only complaint i have about this restaurant is that you will walk out of there smelling like the food. The odor is not the most pleasant so I wouldn't suggest wearing your sunday best."

      "Probably one of the better Chinese places at UIUC, but still not entirely great. We sat down to eat inside and began to peruse the menu which has over 1000 items to choose from.Within 2 minutes we were approached by a waitress and asked if we had any questions, which we did not.After that we were ignored for 15 minutes until we all closed our menus and the waitress immediately came over (maybe that's how it works?).I had the sliced pepper steak which was #644 I believe. For $6.99 it was a pretty decent sized portion. The quality however, was typical of cheap Chinese food, poor. The peppers and onions did not taste fresh at all, but I did still like them. The sauce used was pretty tasty as well as the rice it was served with. Overall, kind of salty, but hey it is Chinese food, right?My friends ordered a seafood Ho-fun and a bok choy and pork, which they said was good.I'd like to try some other menu items. I think Lai Lai is better than Cravings and Chopsticks, for sure.", 
      "Best Chinese food on campus. The family that owns it is really nice. I view Lai Lai Wok as more than a restaurant but a family performing a public service. The selflessness of the owners is legendary, even going so far as to stay open on Mondays after years of taking that day off. Thank you brave people for keeping your fine establishment open to the public so we feast.", 
      "My favorite Chinese restaurant on campus . Serving is quick. \u00a0Food is good, especially the chicken, sour fish soup, tofu . I like it", 
      "I tried this place hoping that I can find some good Chinese food away from where I'm from in Los Angeles. I was excited to see a Chinese place rated highly in Champaign. Yet, when I finally got to try it, it was nothing exciting. I ordered a fried rice, yet it seemed dark which may have been the high amount of soy sauce they put in it. It was definitely a bit too salty. If I had better options, I would definitely go elsewhere. But because of the limited choices in Chinese food in Champaign, this place will have to do. I'd still go here rather than Panda Express I have to say.", 
      "I don't know what I think of Lai Lai Wok. On one hand, they serve decent chinese food, on the other hand, the service can be very spotty. I'd consider this some of the best chinese food on campus, although the competition is weak. If you go, definitely check out items on the chinese language menu (ask your waiter to translate). Thats where they hid all the best dishes.", 
      "Eggplant in garlic sauce. My goodness we wanted to lick that plate clean because that sauce was amazing. It was honestly one of the better Chinese dishes I have had in a while!Good thing we stopped some random undergraduate student on the street and asked him where to eat. He told us this place hands down was the best Chinese, and for paying almost nothing since we got lunch special prices, this place is awesome! I wish they had this in Boston!We also got the tofu and vegetables soup which was flavorful and packed with tons of tofu which we loved. And the squid with black bean sauce was also a hit, although we felt the squid was cooked a little differently texture wise than what we had before, the black bean sauce with it was just so tasty, but the squid I dunno about. And they have unlimited hot tea here too! It is all serve yourself which we didn't quite get at first since none of the signs were written in English, but we figured it out eventually.One tip (literally): we put some tip money in the jar on our way out and they were so so so incredibly thankful! I guess people must not tip here usually? Please tip them people!", 
      "Very very good! Whenever I'm in the mood for Chinese, despite of a lot of options around Campustown, I always go straight to Lai Lai Wok.All the plates I've tried are awesome, well served and cheap (not as cheap as Cravings, but I prefer Lai Lai by far).The chicken plates are particularly good, but that's just my personal favorite.", 
      "Let's get straight to the point: The quality of the food is above average, but the quantity is definitely below average (this is me comparing it to other Chinese restaurants of its type). The waitress suggested the Mongolian beef and it was definitely amazing, but the platter had more onions than Mongolian beef. I also found it interesting that there's a sign that says for people to clean their tables after they are done eating. Sorry guys but this is MURRICA. And in MURRICA, we never clean after ourselves when we eat at a restaurant. We also solve our problems through massive bombings and guns........... MURRICA!", 
      "Best Mala sauce around! I always enjoy the Brisket with it and have never had a sub par experience", 
      "A little overrated, I think?They tend to be closed a fair amount and it's not announced or mentioned on their website, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a website. \u00a0During the summer and winter holidays from school, it seems like they are closed more often than not. \u00a0I only mention this because (due to all the glowing reviews) I have tried to eat there at least 7 times and only been successful twice due to them being closed.The entrees are good and the sauces are tasty. \u00a0Prices are a little on the high side to me - some of the meat dishes have so many vegetables it seems almost like filler. \u00a0I would like it if some of the dishes or sauces were a bit more heavily spiced, though. \u00a0For comparison, Empire and Woori Jib are a bit cheaper. \u00a0It's about the same price range as Golden Harbor and definitely faster, but I've never been blown away by a dish here like I have been at Golden Harbor.So that's pretty much it. \u00a0For campus, a little expensive. \u00a0It works if you really want an on-campus Chinese fix, and it is better than Cravings or Bo-bo China. \u00a0If you are meeting someone here, I'd call first to make sure they are actually open.", 
      "Service was awful. Sat down, was asked to order not even 60 secs later, and then was dutifully ignored the rest of the time. I'm Asian too, but apparently no love there. I had the three-cup chicken, and on a sudden craving an order of crab ragoon. The chicken came out pretty fast in a one of those sizzling bowls (yum!). I was pretty excited because it was drowned in delicious brown, basil sauce and had large bamboo shoots. I totally would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't obvious that the chicken was the normal breaded chicken breast bits used in every other chicken dish Chinese fast food restaurants have. Three-cup chicken should be made with chicken on the bone, with the meat nearly falling off because it has been simmered lovingly. Apparently, my expectations were too high--my bad. The crab ragoon came out nearly at the end of the meal, which caused me much confusion because I had forgotten about it. Nearly burnt to a crisp, but still fried wanton skins filled mayo..can't go wrong with it. I'll come back, and with lowered expectations I am sure I will enjoy myself more.", 
      "Lai Lai Wok has a lot of the standard fare you often encounter in Chinese restaurants, such as sweet and sour chicken. However, it has large enough selection that I prefer it to many other Chinese restaurants in the area (there are lots!). Don't order what you know- branch out here, it's worth it. I would note their menu has an unspoken distinction between the Westernized and more authentic items, which is easy to find- simply note there are two chicken sections and the Westernized contains the familiar items like Kung Pao and Sesame. Try the other section. What keeps me coming back is the Taiwanese Salt and Pepper chicken I randomly ordered off the \"authentic\" section of the menu. It's crispy pieces of peppery chicken fried in ginger. It's wonderful and unlike anything I've ever had. The atmosphere is nothing special and the tea isn't as good as Mandarin Wok's, but the menu makes it worth it.", 
      "My friends and I differentiate between our two favourite Chinese places in C-U: The \"really good one\" (Lai Lai) and \"the really fast one\" (Empire). \u00a0Lai Lai is a bit spartan in its set up, but if you want a great selection, central location, and a delicious menu, hit it up. \u00a0I think it's ideal for a lunch time meet up with people from the university, and the tea dispenser is rather convenient.Enjoy.", 
      "I give 5 stars in the context of the area, Champaign IL.There is no comparable food for the price. I would say that Mandarin Wok is right behind in terms of food selection and quality, but their service is severely lacking.I've known the owner of Lai Lai since I was a wee freshman, and have held many Chinese New Year's dinners at one of the traditional giant round tables for my friends.The food selection is superb and *mostly* authentic. My favorite dishes here are the \"3 Cup Chicken\" aka \"San Bei Ji\", the tofu dishes such as \"Ma Po Do Fu\", and the snowfish that comes out over a flame.The owner is always very accommodating, but keep in mind that I place my table reservations at least two weeks ahead of the dinner.On the days we have the dinner, the owner even let us bring some of our own celebratory big bottles of sake. Although at the expense of her restaurant (no liquor license :X), we really appreciated the gesture of accommodating guests!Even my super-white Illinois-raised friends and classmates all agree that Lai Lai has the most authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food in the area. Like the restaurant name implies (Lai Lai = Come Come), come for great food!P.S. I find it funny that lots of the reviewers are from California, yayyy", 
      "My favorite Chinese place in town. Every single time I go back to Champaign, I HAVE to eat here.I remember the other restaurants that used to be in this location...Fazoli's...Happy Wanderer...that Hawaiian place...but Lai Lai looks like it's here to stay!The food is superb and it comes out pretty fast. Decently priced too. I love the Gan Chao Niu He (dry-fried beef chow fun) because it's never too oily but it's still super tasty. They also have Oh Ah Jian (though it's not on the English menu) which is the Taiwanese oyster pancake that you can buy on the street in Taiwan.The owner is pretty good at treating regular customers well (those who aren't students, that is) with appetizers on the house. Chances are also pretty good you'll run into an ECE professor or two during dinnertime at Lai Lai.In short, Lai Lai is definitely my FAVORITE restaurant near the U of I campus...and maybe in all of the C-U area as well!", 
      "I'm always craving their Taiwanese Style Salt and Pepper Chicken. \u00a0I've pretty much stopped ordering anything else. \u00a0Perfectly seasoned, slightly crispy chicken with fried basil. \u00a0My dining partner got the shredded beef dish (can't remember the exact name) last time that made me rethink my go-to order. \u00a0Maybe I'll rotate. \u00a0I wish they delivered, but nothing worth having is easy.", 
      "Have been here several times and always satisfied with the quality and variety. Most recently had the shrimp and egg fried rice and it was fantastic. We also ordered the fried tofu which was very good, along with traditional chicken and vegetable dishes. If you really know your Chinese food, you can likely talk them into whipping up something the Chinese U of I students eat. Can be a little on the pricey side, but worth it based on the quality.", 
      "Ate here with my wife and Mom while visiting a few weeks ago.I live in Chicago and grew up in the suburbs with a Chinese friend, so I know what good Chinese food tastes like. We ordered: home style tofu, short ribs, and orange chicken.The home style tofu was perfect and had a very nice consistency while the tofu was not simply deep fried and then stir fried - it was cooked properly (something that many restaurants could learn from - leathery tofu is no fun.)The short ribs were awesome! Nice sauce, and the meat was falling off the bone. Good stuff!The orange chicken was crispy and spicy and included the elusive but much wanted \"candied orange peel\" - caramelized the way I like it :-)It was nice that we could hop up and get refills on water and hot tea - I've seen few places that will do this. I've been ignored plenty while eating at \u00a0Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants - I don't think it's rudeness - it's usually that the kitchen is busy and the restaurant is understaffed.We ate late, and were one of three tables. Our service was prompt and good. I think that sometimes you might have to get someone's attention to place an order - not the end of the world by any means for me based on my experiences eating in many restaurants in Chicago.We had leftovers for 2 meals to take home. It's nice that the take-out boxes are easy to find and are self-service. I hate waiting for boxes and hate even more when my food is taken back to the kitchen to be boxed (leaving food behind and anyway I like to see my food while it is boxed.)I'd give it a try if you are a student or are just in town for a few days.", 
      "It's never hard to find cheap Chinese food in Champaign. Just wok onto the Green St. and 4th St. intersection and turn your head one way to find Mandarin Wok or the other way to find Lai Lai Wok. Both are equally good and convenient. It just depends on which side of the street your own and whether or not you want to wok across the street.Okay, maybe there are slight differences. Lai Lai Wok is supposed to be more Taiwanese, where as Mandarin Wok is supposed to be more mainstream. I can't tell the difference since they have many of the same dishes. I do like Lai Lai Wok's soups and noodle varieties. The other dishes are also great and is useful for dining family-style. This place is a good bang for your buck.", 
      "First time trying Chinese food in champaign and was satisfied !!! Great orange chicken. Generous amount of food for a good price, definitely will be back.", 
      "This place is a tad better than Mandarin Wok across the street but they don't take CREDIT CARD. \u00a0I don't like that. \u00a0They also charge more than Mandarin Wok which is ridiculous. \u00a0I would rather go to The Wok in Mahomet.I do think they take some short cuts in their food.. they don't use authentic veggies all the time.. and the lady is not terribly friendly. \u00a0They do have a punch card though.. if you can buy 10 dishes in one month. you get one for free I think.", 
      "Surprisingly good Chinese food in the middle of Champaign.Yes, it is mostly Americanized, but it's not too greasy, and not too crazy with the sauces such that it doesn't overwhelm but instead massages the palate with simple flavors and limited numbers of different textures.The dish I recall the best was the ma pa tofu and hot and sour soups. Simple, convenient, and not too difficult to eat. The noodles were a bit disappointing (lo mein came out a bit.. hm, drier than I thought it would be, almost like the noodles didn't cook properly).", 
      "Went here for a dinner with a group of nine people whilst visiting campus for the weekend. \u00a0We managed to get the extremely large table by the window with a glass lazy susan on it, which helped us share our meals later on. \u00a0The service wasn't that great -- we sat at the table for fifteen minutes before someone realized we were there and gave us menus and waters. \u00a0When our food arrived, some of us had to wait twenty more minutes for theirs to arrive, by then, most of us were done with our portions! Our glasses of water were also sitting empty for awhile (water refilling is a vital part of my ratings).The food was superb, though. \u00a0We all sampled each other's food and not one dish was to my disliking. \u00a0YUM! \u00a0Definitely would come back here on a future visit.", 
      "Best Chinese Food on Campus. I wish they were open late and had delivery, but they already have enough loyal Lai Lai fans ordering takeout and sitting-in to keep them busy. I must comment about how fast their takeout time is. I call, put in my order, they tell me 5-10 min (usually 5 mins), I leave my house, and my hot, delicious is waiting for me on the counter. Great! :)My favorite Lai Lai Wok dishes that will never disappoint my hungry stomach: 1. Crispy Tofu 2. Empress Chicken3. Shrimp in Lobster Sauce4. Mongolian Beef", 
      "Seriously some of the best Chinese I've had. Just as good if not better than Chopstix in Gainesville, FL. This place seems pretty authentic. I got the Taiwanese style salt and pepper chicken. It was so tasty. I could hardly stop eating it. I had plenty of leftovers and ate it twice for dinner, but the portion could've easily served three. The only reason this gets four stars is that it upset my stomach the two days I ate it. But it was so good that I will definitely get food here next time I am wanting chinese.", 
      "Good food with decent service. I tried the spicy tofu and chicken with mushroom. Both were good.The small portion is perfect for 1 person. Order the large portion for 2-3ppl.", 
      "I was pleasantly surprised to find this place in Illinois. After having a miserable experience visiting the campus filled with men who act like they're never seen a lady before and keep making animal noises... this was the highlight of my stay in the state! I got a cup of hot and sour soup first... really flavorful! It also had a nice spicy kick to it, which was refreshing change from the Americanized chinese restaurants I had been eating at. Also their portions are REALLY nice! The cup actually filled me up quite a bit, but I was hungry and I managed to munch on to my entree.LOVED the sliced chicken with garlic sauce and vegetable lo mein noodles! I typically don't like thick noodles, but my mom does so I went with it and I have no regrets about it. I think there was maybe a little too much sauce in the sliced chicken entree and it was a really strong flavor, but I was starving so it didn't phase me. They don't provide chopsticks unless you ask for them... or if you're Asian. lame! Their hot tea was really good too. I wasn't a huge fan of the seating because it kind of seemed like a fast food restaurant in the front and with the tables and there was a weird sign saying: \"Please clean your table for the next customer.\" Super confusing... Great experience though! I'm never ever going back to Illinois... but if I had to, then I'd eat here!", 
      "eh, mediocre chinese food, been here multiple times and always ordered different things. A solid Chinese joint with average prices and above average portions. Nothing that impressive and nothing that bad. Go if you are looking for a less popular(less wait) chinese place and craving chinese", 
      "Today was the first time I went to Lai Lai Wok. I thought the food was definitely above average relative to the other restaurants in Champaign. However, I felt the portions are definitely slightly smaller in comparison to the other places. Overall, I had a pretty nice dining experience and wouldn't mind coming here again.", 
      "One of the worst restaurant experiences I've had. The restaurant looks and feels very dirty. The furniture is old and cheap. After sitting down and eating the food, I had confirmed my reservations about this place.I always drink water at a restaurant, and this is the first restaurant I've been to that doesn't even have cold water. I was given a dirty looking plastic glass filled with room temperature water from one of those sports water dispenser/coolers. Refills are self serve.My family ordered the beef tendon and the braised pork ribs. Rice is free.Beef tendon: came drenched in a bowl of sauce with various pieces of veggies. Not good at all.Pork ribs: tasted pretty much like lazy Chinese BBQ - meat was tough, sauce was thick, overly sweet, and covered with diced onions, and the dish wasn't very hot.Rice: How a Chinese restaurant has bad rice is beyond me but the rice was undercooked. Ugh.This place is also self clean-up. You are expected to bus your own table. You just take your plates and glasses to a plastic tub that they place next to the water cooler and trash cans. Obviously, no tip was left.Food is also pricey, about 12 dollars per dish, including vegetables. Not worth the money at all.I am so disappointed in this restaurant. Apparently others are quite fond of this place, as it tends to be packed when I pass by on my walk home from campus. However, my experience was awful. Would not eat here again.", 
      "Best Chinese place on campus. period.Get the 3 cup chicken (it's $11) and split it with a friend and you get yourself a cheap, filling, and delicious meal.", 
      "It's good for both groups as well as for a couple of friends, and fairly priced too.The food here I have found to be consistently good. \u00a0It's not overly greasy as most Americanized Chinese food joints are, and I love coming here on a cold day for a big bowl of beef-noodle-stew.Remember that whole curse about this location? \u00a0How a restaurant had never been able to last there for more than a year? \u00a0Well, Lai Lai definitely proved everyone wrong and is still going strong.They're pretty hands-off here. \u00a0If you would like more tea or water, get up and get it yourself! \u00a0If you're in a rush to pay the check, walk it up to the front and get it rung up. \u00a0Overall, I much prefer not being all fussed over during my meals, so this works for me =)As everyone else is recommending, their tofu (both mapo and home-style) are very yummy. \u00a0Actually, everything I've had here is very good.Going back again soon!", 
      "After several visits: Food has a consistency that's disappointing. \"Hot\" or \"spicy\" is well below what I can handle, and I'm using the \"Chinese\" menu (single white woman; I don't know if that influences the kitchen & I did not ask the difference between, for instance, the \"Tofu\" section and the \"Chinese Menu Tofu\" section or give special instructions). Put some of three diverse dishes on a plate, and while they look quite different, I don't experience totally different flavors. It's too salty and too oily for health or my palate.Fork provided, chopsticks are up with self service refills for water & tea. Please clean your table. But service has been prompt, questions answered, the check brought promptly when I asked for it right away, and to go containers provided. Portion sizes are generous, but with vegetable dishes costing over $10 they ought to be!IMHO, either this place or one across the street provides decent but not exciting Chinese. Pick based on time of day (dim sum across the street, but only through 3pm) and which is more crowded.", 
      "I was not impressed with the quality of the food and I am lost as to what the fuss is about. The presentation of the food is extremely sub par and the ingredients did not taste fresh. Do not order the ribs as they are covered in a horribly sweet sauce with no depth of flavor, and just had diced onions thrown on top. \u00a0We also ordered the beef tendon soup and it was just a thick, salty bowl of meat. \u00a0I would easily forgive the old cafeteria-style furniture and the buff-your-own-tables for rock your socks off food but when both are bad then you are just in a terrible situation. \u00a0I will go to Golden Harbor or Peking Garden any day.", 
      "A business traveler's perspective: The prices are alright, but the food was really really greasy. I got spring rolls that were dripping and crab rangoon that were somehow greasy and dry cardboardy at the same time. No homemade sweet and sour sauce. The wonton soup was decent, a little light on flavor and the wontons fell apart instantly. I also got mixed sauteed vegetables.. they were cooked nicely and you get a load of rice, but the sauce is pretty heavy and salty. Since I have to eat out when I travel obviously, I ordered the sauteed vegtables thinking I could get something healthy to save for lunch when I wouldn't have time to go out for lunch the next day. Nope. Not great for eat in if you travel and have to eat out a lot, since I have to go to a restaurant all the time, I want to sit somewhere nice if I am going to stay in the place while I eat. As a note I got takeout, but that is a tip I always wish I had ahead of time regardless.", 
      "I've heard lots of praise about this place, but frankly I didn't care too much for Lai Lai Wok at all... and I love Chinese food. \u00a0The place seems to get pretty packed and there is not much room inside, so I would expect a wait if you go during peak hours and want to eat in. \u00a0The service was OK, but the workers had a hard time speaking English, so I didn't know if my order was being taken correctly, and they had a really hard time explaining to me what certain dishes were. \u00a0The food was ok. \u00a0Nothing terribly wrong with it but I guess it did not just suit my fancy. \u00a0I disliked the taste of the sauce used in the entrees. \u00a0It had a very ketchup/hot sauce type of taste to it. \u00a0My parties entrees had similar sauces. \u00a0 Some people might like this type of sauce, but I dislike it strongly.The prices are good, and you get a good sized portion of food. \u00a0It's not a bad restaurant by any means, I just don't prefer their recipes. \u00a0I will be sticking with Golden Harbor.UPDATE: \u00a0Forgot to mention they DON'T take credit cards.... A bit disappointing since we live in 2011....", 
      "Good food. \u00a0Nothing fancy, get your own drink, silverware and you clean up after yourself. \u00a0The food is very good and the portions are a good size. \u00a0If you are looking for fancy linens and a snappy wait staff this is not your place. \u00a0Normally very fast.", 
      "Everything on Lai Lai's menu tastes amazing. \u00a0I've tried chicken with mushrooms, beef with mushrooms, orange chicken, sesame chicken, chicken with black bean sauce, and the spicy chicken with black bean sauce. \u00a0Out of all those, chicken in spicy black bean sauce is definitely the best (and it's not very spicy at all, actually). \u00a0Prices for the entrees are very reasonable, and the portions are so huge that I usually have enough for lunch the next day.", 
      "This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area. I've been coming here ever since I landed in this town about 5 years ago; and the keyword that sticks out in my mind when describing this place is: consistency. No matter how many times I come here the food is always delicious and never lets me down. With so many different, competing Chinese restaurants just in Campustown alone, this place must be something special for me to say it's my favorite in the area, thus proving that not all Chinese places are the same.The food I feel is the most authentic Chinese food I've had ever since moving down, and also provides the best quality food, comparing right on top with my other favorite Chinese restaurant back up north in the suburbs (China House, Schaumburg, IL). \u00a0The food is very fresh and stands out as being the only place I've been to on campus that doesn't come out greasy and flavor masked in an oily feeling in the mouth. The flavor pops with every dish and portion size is pretty generous. \u00a0My favorite dish is anything from the pan fried noodle section. The noodles come out perfect, and as the sauce sinks in, you get a nice balance of crispy and soft-flavor soaked noodles. \u00a0It also comes with a hefty amount of vegetables (bak choy is a plus) and lot of protein (depending on which you got). \u00a0I always surprise whoever I come with because they are always thrown off by the portion size (which is huge). \u00a0Some other dishes that stand out are the Orange chicken (as my friend, who I brought, said it was the best he had in the area). \u00a0Another note, the wait staff is pretty on or off. \u00a0Usually when I go, the only time I see the 'waiter' or owner is when they bring out the food. You have to get your own water/tea and ask for additional items (ie. more rice) at the counter. \u00a0It's not too bad, since it only takes an extra second to do all that. \u00a0Plus it's unlimited tea, and that makes up for it. \u00a0Overall, really good Chinese food and definitely recommend this place to everybody in the area. \u00a0Hopefully, you'll have the same experience I had."

      "I came here for lunch with some co-workers for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised! \u00a0This place has a reputation for being overpriced however, \u00a0I didn't see anything on the lunch menu over $15. I won't say it's world class food or anything (only slightly better than Courier Cafe) but very well prepared and is good for people looking for classic American dishes - no weird exotic ingredients here!", 
      "Silvercreek has been a great place to go to with my parents as a more upscale night out. That being said, I have had some hit or miss experiences with both the food and the service while I have been there. Most recently, I had dinner with my family there to celebrate my graduation for the University of Illinois. We had put in a reservation for our party well in advance and paid a substantial deposit. We showed up slightly early for the reservation and still had to wait almost an hour after the designated time. We were repeatedly told that it wouldn't be much longer, but by the time our party got to the table we were starving and pretty tired of being there. While I recognized that graduation is a very hectic time for people, I just did not understand what the point of making a reservation was when we had to wait as long as people who walked in the door. Once we were seated, the service was a little slow but was much more reasonable. Everyone enjoyed the food, which was flavorful and filling. Our favorite item was some sort of crab hushpuppies that were simply phenomenal. However, on other occasions, I have ordered fish dishes and found them to be somewhat bland. Overall, this place is a nice place to eat if you're looking for somewhere with a fancy vibe in Urbana. However, I would steer clear of it for important events (parents weekends, graduation, homecoming and other peak times) and check the menu before you go to ensure that the food suits your tastes.", 
      "Yelp steered us here for brunch, but your only option is a buffet. \u00a0And it's not good.My waffle was okay, but the syrup dish had a lot of \"skin\" that had developed in the tray. \u00a0Kinda chunky when pouring it out.The bacon and sausage weren't particularly flavorful. \u00a0The \"homemade\" biscuits were hard.Of all the places we ate in Champaign, this was the worst. \u00a0Definitely not worth $20+ for the same kind of Sterno-warmed slop you'd find at Old Country Buffet.Go get a cup of Jarling's Custard and make that your brunch.", 
      "Perhaps if I had eaten any food I could rate the food but this is a rating of service only. After a short wait to be seated I was given a table and a menu. When five minutes had passed and no one had come to the table not even to bring a water I was starting to wonder where a server was. After another five minutes had passed I was becoming rather annoyed. I decided to wait another two minutes for anyone to come to the table and when no one did I left.", 
      "The food is decent, so this one-star review is really about the way that Silvercreek treats its costumers. \u00a0We went there on graduation weekend and it was busy, but we were assured that the wait would be only 10 minutes, so we stayed. The wait was not 10 minutes, but more like an hour. Every time we asked for an update we were assured that we would be seated in a few minutes... After we sat down we waited more than an hour to get our food. Mostly what we ordered were salads, so there's no way it should have taken that long. \u00a0After about an hour they offered us some chips...The food was decent but expensive, as they upped the prices for their special graduation weekend menu. I probably would not have cared so much about the money, had we not had to wait for so long...for salads.Yes, I understand that it was graduation weekend, but the host should not have promised seating in 10 minutes, just to keep us from leaving. It was clear that they had more business than they could handle, but just wanted the opportunity to make as much money as possible. By the way, people who had reservations didn't seem to fare much better...and they had to put down a $50 deposit just to reserve a table.By the way, I went to several other restaurants that weekend with my boyfriend and his parents, including Bread Company, Biaggi's, and Big Grove, which were just as swamped as Silvercreek and received much better service in all of them. Also, they were honest about our wait time.", 
      "I always like this place. I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here.", 
      "This is a mixed review. 5 stars, 3 stars and 1 star in one based on my experiences in 2013.5 STARS: I highly recommend going to the Empty Bowls fundraiser held every spring at Silvercreek. You get soup and bread and get to pick a handmade pottery bowl created by local artists. Proceeds go to the Daily Bread Soup Kitchen. 3 STARS: The soup and bread was so phenomenal that my husband I decided to try Easter brunch at Silvercreek. Not the cheapest buffet, but we thought the food would be excellent based on our experience with soup and bread.The appetizers and the main course were all good, especially the prime rib. BUT \u00a0the desserts offered were way sub-par compared to the quality of the main course and appetizers. With the exception of the vanilla bread pudding, which was very good, and the berry cobbler, which I did not have because it was gone, the assorted desserts seemed like they were NOT made fresh from scratch. Honestly, these were desserts that would be seen at a church potluck with friends rather than at the type of restaurant Silvercreek projects.It was very disappointing because I look forward to desserts. I eat less \"real\" food because I want to eat more desserts.1 STAR: After our brunch experience, I emailed the restaurant telling them our experience and mainly asking if the desserts offered at Easter brunch were representative of the dessert menu at Silvercreek.I received NO response, so I don't know. Even at Courier Cafe (same owner), I can't bring myself to order dessert (other than milkshakes).", 
      "Sorry Silvercreek, but I just can't with you. I've been here probably 20 times over the course of many years. It's never my choice-- Champaign has a handful of restaurants where everyone goes when they're looking for a somewhat upscale experience and Silvercreek falls into this category. And so I find myself here for graduation celebrations, birthdays, meals for when relatives are visiting, and so on. Most of my experiences here have been for their Sunday buffet brunch. They offer your standard biscuits, gravy, bacon, potatoes, as well as some lunch-ier fare like pasta and prime rib. It is all less than mediocre. Last time I was there for brunch, my dad said, \"We should have gone to Ryan's.\" Ouch. They have a pretty big selection of desserts. It really grinds my gears that even though they have an omelet and waffle station, they can't make eggs to order because they only have a big bowl of premade egg mix on hand. So yeah, no fresh eggs on hand. They have scrambled eggs in the buffet line but... gross. Side note, try not to get seated by the omelet station. It gets boiling hot. Last time I was here, I actually dunked my cloth napkin in my water and dabbed my face and neck with it. I mentioned the heat to the hostess on the way out-- she asked how the meal was-- and her response was \"Oh, in the greenhouse? Yeah, hot day.\" No, not in the greenhouse. But that reminds me...My best friend had her bridal shower at Silvercreek about a year ago, in the greenhouse. In the middle of the meal, one of the chandeliers DROPPED FROM THE CEILING and shattered on the middle of a table. Unreal. The staff did not know how to handle the situation and the only compensation was free dessert. This place is such a mess.", 
      "Just hosted my daughters bridal shower at Silvercreek. I would highly recommend it. Most of the planning was done via telephone as I'm from out of town but I couldn't be happier with the end result! The food \u00a0and desserts were everything I expected and more! The waitstaff was super helpful and courteous...they were wonderful! Thanks Silvercreek for a wonderful bridal shower! I definitely recommend!", 
      "I don't hand out a lot of five-star reviews but this place definitely deserves one. From the food to the ambience to the helpful and wonderful staff this place has it all. You will definitely not be disappointed here.", 
      "The food was good, but it doesn't outweigh the management practices. The experience was bordering on a nightmare. Definitely a stressful and extremely unpleasant dream.Graduation day at U of I. Reservations were made far in advance. We had a 9pm reservation with a $50 required deposit. When we walked in a few minutes before 9, we found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with angry and annoyed patrons. We spoke to several people who had been waiting to be seated 1, 2, and even 2 and a half hours AFTER their reservation time. They know how to take a reservation, just not how to keep the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation.So, due to the $50 required credit card deposit, all those people were stuck waiting and waiting and waiting. After waiting an hour, we asked what would happen if we left, and they said they would charge us $50. I'm pretty sure this wouldn't hold up in a court of law, but the small claims filing fee is more than $50 so they have people hooked. When we were finally seated an hour and a half after our \"reservation\" time, the 5 of us were squished into a small booth with a chair at the end. There was no space for that chair. It was very uncomfortable. Were our drinks comped? Were we offered anything for our long wait? No. The server was very nice, but we were starved and exhausted and really annoyed. The food was great, but way overpriced. I had \"little parcels\" pasta filled with cheese. Really great. The taste was worth 5 stars. I find management's policy on the U of I graduation date coupled with their failure to keep reservations absolutely unacceptable. It is completely unnecessary, their restaurant would be packed skipped reservations or not. The management decided to take this opportunity to swindle people.", 
      "A friend and I went there for Sunday Brunch. \u00a0Now this is $20.95 so we had great expectations. \u00a0However, none of the chafing dishes had any flame under them so the food was cold....cold gravy over little biscuits the size of a poker chip and the consistency of a hockey puck were awful...cold jambalya, cold macaroni and cheese....everything was cold. \u00a0The shrimp for the shrimp cocktail was so over-cooked as to be mushy. \u00a0The waffles were cold...I should have waited in the long line to have one made fresh....For the price I would NOT recommend, nor would I go back.", 
      "Atmosphere, food, & service is wonderful. You can't go wrong here. Throw on a tie and head out for a great meal.", 
      "Dad's day needs a step up on the C-U restaurant ladder, don't you think?We made a reservation at Silvercreek and were so glad to have this beautiful, WARM and welcoming spot to retire to after another bitter loss on the field.The lunch menu is not quite as diverse as the dinner menu but we all loved our entrees. \u00a0We started with the corn chowder which was filling and nuanced. \u00a0My husband had the special pork tenderloin and my daughter and I had the vegetable ravioli - rich and delicious. \u00a0Plus the best bread basket in town.I was a tad diaspointed in the chocolate cake - beautiful but the taste was dull. \u00a0That cake looked so much better than it tasted. \u00a0Had the dessert been better, this would be a five. \u00a0I have been there multiple times and have long felt this is the weak link in an otherwise great restaurant.When the football team disappoints, the food will not! I L LI N I", 
      "I was very impressed with the quality of service and the food at Silvercreek! \u00a0Headed there for the first time for a friend's birthday with a large group of people. \u00a0Since I try to eat vegan and I know it can be a pain to sort that out in a large party, I called ahead to ask if there were any vegan items on the menu. \u00a0The hostess was incredibly helpful, pointing me toward a couple of salads and a vegetarian entree that could easily be made vegan, and reassuring me that if nothing on the menu caught my eye, the chef would be more than happy to create something for me with the veggies and pasta they have available.Service at the restaurant was equally good. \u00a0I went with the autumn salad (Garden greens, apricots, pears, grapes, pecans, hazelnut vinaigrette) which was refreshing and delicious, and the stuffed poblano peppers (Black bean, corn & rice stuffing, red onion, cilantro, chihuahua cheese, paquillo pepper sauce) without the cheese. \u00a0The peppers were TO DIE for. \u00a0The pepper sauce was insane, creamy and delicious, yet somehow dairy free. \u00a0I still wish I had gotten that recipe!I'd definitely recommend Silvercreek for any vegans or non-vegans looking to get a high-quality meal!", 
      "On Friday's Sivercreek has 'appyhour that is great! Half price appetizers in the bar area and live music. I love the atmosphere here and the regular Firday night bartendar is great (Brooke). She always knows what to recommend to drink and I hear she makes an amazing Bloody Mary. She prepares them prior to the Sunday brunch, which I still have yet to taste.The fries are really good with truffle oil and the Steak & blue cheese Quesadillas are excellent. The 'appyhour menu changes regularly, which is nice if you visit often.They have a large selection of bottled beers and change the tap regularly. They also have a good selection of wine. I just recently relocated to Urbana from Chicago and am happy to have found a place that I can frequent and always leave smiling!", 
      "Two key points: 1. Lunch: cheaper, laid-back2. French fries with garlic aioli: fatty deliciousness (You must ask for the aioli.)They have a decent lunch, though I really just go for the french fries. Other lunch food worthwhile: tomato bisque, chicken salad wrap, and grilled cheese. I was never in a burger mood when there, but I see a lot of people ordering it.Service here often becomes great fodder for conversation afterward. I mean, there was a waitress who was super perky and nodded vigorously whenever I asked for something--to then come back happily each time, completely forgetting that I asked for anything at all. I forced a friend to steal sugar from tables because of her. And another waiter who ran around in a rush as if someone was holding a gun to him and ordering him to drop those checks off, stat.", 
      "You could do better a chain restaurant. Food and service are below average and they are not even that busy. Man where is an Outback restaurant in Urbana? I guess it's been here long enough so people send us strangers and visitors here but find somewhere else and do better than here. My second time and won't need to try again.", 
      "Amazing lunch for a decent price! I don't know why everybody is bitching so hardcore about this place. I almost didn't try this place because of all the one star reviews but my grandma loves the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e here so we went.I had the lunch combo: half the gourmet grilled cheese (awesome), tomato basil soup (amazing), and sweet potato french fries (nothing to rave about but nothing bad with them).For dessert we had the vanilla creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e topped with fresh blueberries and strawberries. AMAZING! We both had lunch, a dessert, and each an herbal tea (great selection of herbal teas!) and the total was only $34.50.They also have a nice outdoor area to sit.", 
      "This is a review of the Sunday brunch which is AWWWWESOME! I usually try to get a group to go to brunch every couple of months and we always come here. \u00a0There is so much on the buffet ranging from a waffle station, omelette station, salads, veggies, pasta, salmon, shrimp, potatoes, a carving station, and an absolutely wonderful array of desserts to choose from! \u00a0I walk out of here feeling stuffed for days! \u00a0While the cost is not cheap- I think it's around $19 including a beverage, it is well, well worth it! I have tried the other top Sunday brunch place in Urbana, and Silvercreek blows them away! \u00a0:)", 
      "We haven't been to Silvercreek in years - we were disappointed with the food. Rumor spread that they got a new manager. \u00a0We decided to give them another try. The Chef's Line Burger is best burger in town - no exageration. Even my wife thinks so and she does not like to eat burgers. Tonight we enjoyed the appetizer buffet with oysters, chicken, shrimp, salads, artichoke dip, fresh fruit and chef cooked steak on the grill - delicious. You must try the Peach Kuchen to finish your meal. Silvercreek is now our local favorite. If you haven't been lately you must give them a try.", 
      "Atmosphere is warm and comfortable. Waitstaff is attentive but mostly young and inexperienced. Food was... Ok. Ordered the mixed grill special. Gremolata ( overpowering and chemical flavor) on over-cooked scallops, undercooked fingerling potatoes and a passable steak with uninspired brown sauce poured over. Overall, quite \"ok\" but no better. Highlight was the dessert, a chocolate cake with ganache and mousse. Best part of the meal was feeling welcome to linger and chat, which we certainly did.", 
      "This is one of the finer restaurants in Urbana, owned by the same people as at Courier Cafe, just up the road. \u00a0It loses a couple stars because it wants to be a fine dining establishment with an accompanying pricetag, but the servers are generally not as experienced as you'd like (although they are trying, so it's not right to totally pan them). \u00a0And the food quality and inventiveness leaves something to be desired. \u00a0They have a good location, dining rooms, including a nice garden room, and it's quite comfortable overall. \u00a0It just needs an infusion of talent.For brunch, four stars.", 
      "This place is one of the nicer places to go for a fancy meal. \u00a0The decor is quite nice.. the service can be a hit or miss. \u00a0I would NOT go for their Sunday brunch. \u00a0I think it's kind of expensive and they pretty serve the leftovers from Saturday night.I really like their steaks. \u00a0Those are pretty good. \u00a0Nothing else really stood out in my mind. \u00a0I think I would rather go to Timpone's (see my review) and pay the same price. \u00a0The only thing you just don't get is the as-nice-decor.", 
      "We came here for lunch and had a good experience. The landscaping and the atmosphere are great. Very friendly service. I enjoyed my Italian turkey club, which came with good sweet potato fries. Would return if in the area again.", 
      "I've heard good things about Silvercreek's brunch, but woke up too late Sunday to go, so my friend and I settled on trying their dinner instead.Despite the weather starting to cool off, we decided to sit outside and enjoy the last traces of summer. \u00a0Sunday = 1/2 price wine night (per glass) which was surprising as their wine isn't unreasonably priced to begin with (~ $5-$9), and they have a nice selection to choose from.We split their goat cheese salad, I ordered their stuffed chicken breast, and my friend got their 5-spiced alaskan halibut (which I tried a bite of). \u00a0We both agreed that the chicken was really yummy and juicy, anwhile their halibut was well cooked and moist, I found it a bit tasteless (plus a on the more expensive for what you got).The ambiance is quite romantic (both inside and out), but you don't need to dress up unless you want (I was just in shorts, a tee, and a fleece), and it's just a nice place for a quiet dinner.I'm going between 3 and 4 stars here, but I until I try their brunch, I'll have to say 3.", 
      "I have to say, this has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in Chambana. \u00a0I've only visited for lunch and although their dinner menu looks good, I haven't made a trip to try. \u00a0I have always had great service and the food has always been wonderful. \u00a0The only time I haven't been completely pleased was with the Farro salad which came with veggies, but there were only two quarter pieces of zucchini and two 1-inch slices of asparagus. \u00a0This place is now my go-to restaurant for lunch because of the extensive burger and sandwich menu. \u00a0They have great sides and the prices are great for the quality of food and creativity.", 
      "I went to Silvercreek for lunch today with my dad-- and I feel like it's undervalued for lunch! \u00a0I had pesto rock shrimp pasta ($8.25 and the most expensive lunch item,) and though I wish the menu had mentioned it was a light pesto cream sauce, it was delicious, and the garlic bread was awesome. \u00a0My dad had their burger of the day, and he loved it too. \u00a0Our waitress was a little spacey, but that'll happen.Our entire meal including drinks and tip was still under $25; you can get a bill higher than that for lunch at places \u00a0with far inferior quality of food.", 
      "My bf and I went with another couple to this place as we'd heard great reviews. The ambiance is wonderful and we had a very friendly and attentive server. The food was absolutely delicious. The only downside was they were out of the one dessert we wanted to order but I would definitely go back to dine again (especially to try for the chocolate cake again).One of the nicer places in Champaign and Urbana - loved it!", 
      "When I was about to leave Champaign for Chicago, my boss and I went on a culinary tour around Chambana and Silvercreek was on the top of our list. She was raving about the Sunday brunch and they were right, it was so so good. There's an egg station if you want your eggs custom made. Then there's other fancy meats, fish like whole smoked salmon, pastries, and of course, desserts. \u00a0The price tag is expensive for the Chambana area but the food selection will all be worth it. This is a must do for anyone in town.", 
      "This was an unexpected fuel stop for a small group of us last weekend after discovering the long wait at the Courier Cafe just up the street. \u00a0The restaurant has a warm & cozy feel to it - equipped with a full fireplace and lodge-esque interior. \u00a0The bread variety was quite delicious - esp. the olive and rye breads. \u00a0I ordered the jumbo shrimp appetizer (the name escapes me), which was incredibly spicy. \u00a0It was ok. \u00a0I also ordered the spinach salad, which was quite good. \u00a0My fiancee ordered the pot roast entree, which I sampled, and it was actually very good. \u00a0My friend ordered the brie appetizer, which was also quite tasty. \u00a0The only downside was the service, which was slightly lacking. \u00a0The price is moderate but nothing completely unreasonable. \u00a0They also have a nice selection of domestic and import beverages, which always makes me warm and fuzzy inside.", 
      "I was really expecting much better things from this restaurant. Based on the good reviews and seemingly more upscale menu, I thought this would be a nicer restaurant with good decor and great food. Well, not so much. My friend and I showed up around 7:30 on a Friday night and the place was only about half full. That should have been our first hint. The restaurant has a rather strange look what with the exposed brick and ceiling beams combined with the country-style tables, carpet, and booths. Overall, it just looked a little dated and old, especially the booths that were in a bit of disrepair. The dinner menu isn't huge and has a handful of selections for seafood, steaks, and pasta. I opted for the potato-crusted whitefish. It came with a cream sauce, asparagus, mushrooms, and carrots. It came out nicely presented, but when I lifted up the outer potato crust and got a glimpse of the actual fish I was so annoyed. I'm not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that piece of fish was 2x2 inches. Maybe you're not supposed to notice that with all the potato lumped on top of it, but at $18 that was absolutely ridiculous. My friend said her lobster mac and cheese was good, but so rich she could only eat half. And, BTW, it was corkscrew pasta, not macaroni.Sadly, I didn't order a salad because those actually looked pretty good. And there was also a good looking maple banana cake, but I refused to spend any more money there so I can't attest to the desserts. Overall, this place is way, way overpriced and I would never go back.", 
      "This place wants to be better than it actually is. The ambiance is really quite nice. They did a great job restoring the building and the grounds. It is beautiful, and it was also \u00a0the first smoke-free restaurant in town. I very much appreciated that at the time. The food wants to be outstanding, but it is only very good. For as much as this place costs, I want it to be better. More innovative, more spectacular. The wait staff is mostly very young and not quite experienced enough to pull off the fine dining experience. One time, one of them addressed my dining companion as \"dude.\" He took offense, and rightly so. We are not your surfin' buddies, we are your customers. That said, this is a great place for a big celebratory dinner with your whole family. It's a beautiful setting, the wine and beer lists are good, and your grandmother will be able to find something she wants to eat. So will your vegetarian cousin and her picky five-year-old, and so will you.", 
      "Silvercreek is one of my favorite places to go when I'm in the mood to be pampered with great service and excellent food. \u00a0The restaurant's ambience is just about perfect, with romantic lighting and a beautiful garden room that's just breathtaking (more on that in a minute).There are some complaints on here about the food, but I think it's delicious. \u00a0I haven't had anything here I didn't like. \u00a0One of my favorites is a salad, whose name escapes me at the moment, made with field greens, goat cheese, toasted walnuts, dried cherries, and a champagne vinaigrette dressing. \u00a0It's simply divine; I could be happy with just that. \u00a0However, it just keeps getting better. \u00a0I think the chefs are pretty creative, although the menu hasn't changed much in the three years I've lived here. \u00a0The desserts are excellent, as is the wine selection.I've heard that brunch is fabulous, but we've only been for lunch once and dinner a handful of times. \u00a0They put on quite a show for New Year's Eve, with a special menu and a generally festive atmosphere. \u00a0It was New Year's Eve 2004 that my sweetie and I were sitting in that gorgeous garden room, enjoying a night out on the town, when all of a sudden, a diamond ring was staring me in the face, and my sweetie was down on one knee asking me to marry him. \u00a0Now, Silvercreek isn't directly responsible for one of the happiest nights of my life, but they certainly helped make it as perfect as it was, and for that, I thank them.", 
      "I ate here last night and I was very impressed. I loved the atmosphere, and the food was very good. Everyone who took care of me was very attentive and knowledgeable.The bread that came with the meal was very tasty. I started off with the Roasted Squash Panzaella which is a crouton salad, and it was very good. There were too many croutons in it for me, but I just picked out some of them and ate the rest. For the entree, I got the Crispy Potato Crusted Michigan Whitefish. It was so good. I loved every bite. By the time I got to the end, \u00a0I was glad that I had not eaten all of the croutons in the appetizer.For dessert, I got the Apple Dumpling A La Mode and again it was amazing. It was on the small side, but I thought it was the perfect size for me. Someone else may be disappointed that it wasn't bigger but any bigger and I would not have been able to eat it all.All in all, I was very happy with my experience and if I am ever in town again, I will definitely go back.", 
      "Fourth time there, first time for Sunday brunch. \u00a0Not too much, not too little food, but what was there was great. \u00a0Really dug the peppered fried chicken. \u00a0Desert selection was wide and I became a fan of the Bailey's Chocolate Cake. \u00a0Was seated in the converted greenhouse which added (positively) to the experience. \u00a0Look forward to trying the brunch again. \u00a0Only negative (also positive) was the huge crowd.", 
      "Happy hour always fun", 
      "Amazing place for the sunday brunch. The waffles and maple syrup are amongst the best you will get in town! Don't miss out on the enticing array of deserts, it is easy to, since there is such a wide variety of food before it!", 
      "Delicious! \u00a0I was in town to visit my brother and we went there for dinner. \u00a0! \u00a0They serve warm bread with the meal, which is always a good start.I had the filet and it was soo good, and we shared a couple desserts for dessert and I would recommend each on - creme brule, bread budding, and a torte.It was so good we went for their Sunday brunch. \u00a0It's $20.95 and worth every penny! \u00a0When can you get salmon, prime rib, fresh waffles, red velvet cake for $20! \u00a0It also comes with drinks included (I had juice and coffee).They also have an awesome beer and wine selection - much better than your typical restaurant.I would seriously recommend this place!", 
      "I never choose this place but end up here a couple times a year because this is where people want to go (for whatever reason). It's always disappointing. After reading some of the reviews I can see it's not just me. Two repeat offenses. (1) reservations that are meaningless because they either overseat or over-reserve, and (2) mediocre food & service. Not worth it. Too bad Kennedy's closed."

      "The variety of options for lunch, dinner, and/or dim sum may seem a tad overwhelming, but any choice made is delicious and well-priced. There is a menu with the usual dishes: beef, chicken, tofu, vegetable, eggplant, etc. However, there's another menu that I would consider more authentic, and has gems like water spinach with fresh garlic, as well as non-vegetarian friendly items such as beef tendon.During my most recent visit my group ordered golden tofu with chili sauce, coconut milk cakes (dim sum), water spinach, cashew tofu, and chicken lo mein. All agreed that both tofu dishes were excellent, the water spinach is a new and delicious discovery, and we could eat coconut milk cakes all day if they'd hold still between our chop sticks. Even with lots of variety on the menus, quality at Mandarin Wok isn't compromised.", 
      "I came here for their dim sum. they were NOT GOOD. end of the story.tips:if you like dim sum, i suggest you go to a Asian grocery store, such as: Far East, Green onion, Amko, or that little shop on Neil street called Chang's. They have packaged frozen dim sun: sesame balls, custard bun, BBQ buns, shrimp dumplings, you tiao and stuff like that! its so much cheaper and more! all you gotta do is steam or microwave them, then you are good to go!", 
      "Beware of dirty tricks!I used to eat here frequently. However, my last two visits were terrible. The restaurant substituted a $14 fish dish for a $26 fish, without informing us. They simply served it. The first time I was not sure. The second time I asked and pointed out that it is a different kind of fish. They said they ran out of the fish I ordered, and reimbursed the price difference. But apparently they would just keep the overcharge if I had acquiesced. And of course I am expected to be happy with a fish I haven't even ordered.Make sure you're eating THE fish you ordered (not some cheap substitute) if you go to Mandarin Wok.", 
      "Alright, i'm back to not liking the dim sum here.... I went in the other day, ordered my usual (hargow, siu mai, , eggplant, etc) and sat at my table. \u00a0The tea was hot as usual...the floors were sticky, greasy and slippery. \u00a0The food came out fairly quickly....the shiumai was an odd color... Rather than the mustard yellow color of the wonton wrapper, it was a weird dead brown hue.... Everything tasted as if it was frozen or maybe made last week and pulled out of the fridge. YUCK. \u00a0 I looked around and noticed that everyone had order noodle soup bowls....pho, etc.... I'll do that next time. \u00a0I question the health code standards here....", 
      "Small portions compared to the rest of the asian places on green st, especially when the price is almost the same. The food is good though.", 
      "The food is all right. Just like the other chinese restaurant on green street, the positioning of what kinda food it shall serve is very bad. How could a restaurant try to cook all styles of chinese food. Chinese cuisine ain't American fried shit. Trying to make everything always end up failing at everything.", 
      "Not bad Chinese food at all - we came here for Sunday dimsum which was pretty decent. \u00a0Service was decent, dim sum was good but there were some dishes that I was a bit disappointed by, but the ones that were pretty satisfactory included the spareribs in black bean sauce, beef tripe, bean curd, and the shrimp shui mi.Just a tip - be careful of which tea that you end up pouring - for some reason, I ended up with a cup full of hot sugar water. \u00a0And oh, yeah - they don't take card so make sure that you have cash with you.", 
      "After coming back here for the pho (Vietnamese noodles), I have to upgrade the rating to 4.5 stars, or basically rounded up to 5.Hungover after a night a the bars, the gf recommended grabbing pho at Mandarin Wok. I never even knew that this super-Chinese restaurant would offer Vietnamese noodles, let alone if it was authentic or not.Surprise. Surprise.The pho was EXCELLENT. Far exceeding the likes of legitimate Vietnamese establishments in the Champaign-Urbana area. I would venture to say that it rivals the pho I get back home in the San Francisco Bay Area, but that's probably because my pho-addicted brain craves any substitute.. although the Yelper in me looks for quality and authenticity :]Soup base was flavorful, noodles chewy, meat offering varied and delicious. And they even bring the bean sprouts, herbs, and jalapeno slices.You will not be disappointed coming here for a hot steaming bowl of pho. If you've never had pho in your life, consider trying it at Mandarin Wok a first step to something incredible.*Caveat*: only order the beef pho, as according to another Yelper the seafood pho is whack.", 
      "I used to walk past this place all the time for the last 3 years and finally had the opportunity to come here with my boyfriend. We were craving pho, and normally we go to Cravings for that but he had come here with his boss and swore it was better here. Noting the couple in front of us eating the beef version of pho I got excited. We ordered the seafood pho.When it came I noticed there was something immediately wrong: the noodles looked suspiciously like Top Ramen egg noodles instead of rice noodles but I dug in cos I was so hungry. My boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different. It also had no garnish (bean sprouts, basil), no lime, and there was no oil that normally comes in the soup. When we inquired the lack of garnish or lime, we were informed by a very nervous waitress that our pho was \"special\". We then asked for srirarcha (sp?) and got a tiny dollop of it. All in all we paid $16 for beef Top Ramen with seafood floating in it. It was very salty and unpleasant. I felt disgusted that I actually ate half since I was so hungry.Multiple theories as to why we were treated this way. The couple in front of us had the beef pho and it had the garnish and the lime/oil and rice noodles.1) We didn't look Asian enough: I'm Filipino Italian (look at my profile picture) and my boy is Filipino but could pass for Latino sometimes. They were too cheap to serve us the real thing or thought they could get away with serving us the ramen since we \"didn't know any better anyway\".2) They were out of ingredients and were too lazy to bother telling us \u00a0and offer alternatives or a refund.3) A combination of number 1 and 2.I guess it serves us right for going into a Chinese restaurant for pho but Cravings serves multiple Asian dishes as well and they got it right. What made us the most angry is the fact that the Asian couple in front of us got exactly what they wanted and we left unsatisfied. My boy swears he got good soup there but his boss is more Asian looking and could be the reason why they got it right. NEVER AGAIN STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!", 
      "I got American-style Chinese food, the Empress Chicken with steamed rice, which was \"meh.\" \u00a0However, some of the more authentic dishes looked pretty good... and their tofu looked awesome.In general they were okay. I'll break it down list style:Pluses:Cheap. $5 something for decent lunch portions with steamed or fried rice.The tea, Jasmine or Chrysanthemum, is free.With giant round table w/ lazy susans, this place is PERFECT for groups.The tofu, soups, and more traditional dishes looked good.Minuses:The fried American-style dishes were food-court quality.My companion found a bug in her food.The atmosphere is as good as the service--somewhat non-existent. I will probably return, especially if I have a group, and will order something else.", 
      "Mandarin Wok was one of the few affordable and authentic Chinese restaurants on the U of I campus. The regular dinner menu is huge and the food is good. Dishes come out with pretty decent portions. My friends and I have often claimed Mandarin Wok as our official birthday dinner place. There are several tables meant for big groups and for college kids, we were never disappointed. In addition, the clutch thing about this place is definitely the fact they they served dim sum. To me, that's always a win.", 
      "Ever since they changed owners.. it just hasn't been the same. \u00a0Sure.. they amped up the decor and furniture.. and the nicest part is that they take credit card (not like Lai Lai across the street) but the food really doesn't cut it. \u00a0What I mean is.. they have started taking short cuts in order to boost their profits. \u00a0I ordered fried tofu which used to be good.. but they used old expired tofu. \u00a0That's gross. \u00a0If you must eat here.. I would get the Singaporean rice noodles ($7 for a huge plate) or the dimsum. \u00a0The dimsum dishes are okay... they are really just frozen that they heat up for you. \u00a0If you want the old Mandarin Wok quality.. I would HIGHLY recommend going to the Wok in Mahomet (it's like a five minute drive on 74 W).", 
      "As far as the authenticity of the food by far the best anywhere in Champaign/Urbana, \u00a0wife and I ordered baby squid in basil sauce and the peking pork, the squid was cooked perfectly and spiced perfectly. \u00a0The peking pork was fried to perfection and the sauce was very tasty. \u00a0They have updated their menus so that the good stuff can be read in English now. \u00a0Their dim sum is pretty standard items, but the only real place to go in Champaign, myself I would probably wait till I get back to Chicago for that.The down side of this place is their are two waitress that also work in the kitchen, everything is self serve the tea, drinks, even your utensils. \u00a0So do not come here expecting great service, but all in all the most authentic chinese restaurant in Champaign!!", 
      "I must have spent thousands at this place when I was attending UIUC from 2002-2006 since it was directly across from my apartment and because I was too damn lazy to cook. If you are not Chinese, I would definitely suggest to bring one with you to help dissect their massive Chinese-written menu since it has all the goodies on there such as the oh-so-tender beef tendon.", 
      "Mandarin Wok has been hit or miss for me, mostly depending on whether I go with a person who can read and order from the real menu or whether I have to order myself from the English menu. \u00a0It's in campustown, so I usually never go there unless it's for a departmental luncheon, and then I don't have to pay. \u00a0In fact, I've never gone to Man Wok one time when I had to spend my own money. \u00a0I think it is more \"authentic\" than any of the other chinese restaurants I have eaten at in champaign. \u00a0But they still serve orange chicken. \u00a0Tonight when I was there, I noticed that they have a plasma screen tv in the party room now. \u00a0It was playing a chinese game show. \u00a0Of some sort.", 
      "Ever since I went to Hong Kong, I have been a huge fan of Dim Sum :) Unfortunately, there are not a lot of places to get it in central Illinois, but this is one of them (if not the only one) and it is also surprisingly pretty darn good... Now, I have been working on my Cantonese, but it's not great...so I will explain my favorite dishes using my lame english terms. 1) Pork Dumplings - good...not really unique or anything; pretty standard for dim sum 2) Sesame rolls - AWESOME!!! I am usually not a huge fan of these, but theirs are pretty decent and sweeter than I remember. 3) shrimp crepes - pretty good...I would have liked more shrimp though 4) chicken feet - cooked really well; these were pretty big and more filling then I think is typical 5) Spare Ribs - they came in a sauce that I can't really remember the name of, but it was good and not too salty 6) Turnip Cake - probably my favorite, but I always love it :) 7) Congee - this came with a pork sausage which was tasty. I was getting pretty full at this point, but the congee was good enough to keep me going... The place also has really good jasmine and chrysanthemum tea, which is refreshing on a chilly day :)The only thing I wish they did here was use the carts, but it is a small place and they serve other items then Dim Sum so I understand...", 
      "I was pleasantly surprised with this place. \u00a0It serves quite capable food, both American-Chinese style and some reasonably authentic food as well.It's fancy, and their most authentic foods are written on the walls in Chinese, but I went with a Chinese friend and had a good meal, about as good as an average place in Chicago's Chinatown. \u00a0Three stars is supposed to be \"A-OK\" and I think that fits this place. \u00a0I might not go out of my way to eat here again, but I'd have no problem going back again if I was in Urbana.Service wasn't the best, but it wasn't horrifyingly bad either.", 
      "My friends and I ended up eating here just randomly, walking down the street to find something to eat. We were actually heading over to Ihop, but saw that Mandarin Wok had dim sum, so we stopped in.I've never experienced this type of service before - or lack there of. They bring the food out to you and plates, but everything else is up to you. Get your own drinks (chrysanthemum tea, jasmine tea, or water), your own utensils, your own sauce (they had packaged soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce, usually not what I use for dim sum), and you have to get up and order at the cashier.They should really put a sign up or make sure people know to order, a family walked in while we were half way done with our dim sum, and they just sat there. The girl who was working wasn't doing anything important but she didn't even walk over to them, give them a menu, or anything until the man called for her.Anywho, the dim sum just reaches the bare minimum for passing off as an okay meal. Perhaps in a small town it's good, but it doesn't compare to Chinatown in the Chi.There wasn't a lot of options, only about 25 items. My favorite thing for dim sum is shrimp crepes and turnip cake. Both of which were disappointing! The shrimp crepe only had two small pieces of shrimp. The turnip cake was just off, seemed like it wasn't cooked right. \u00a0The shui mai and shrimp dumpling were small, but it tasted fine.Not entirely saddened by this experience because at least it wasn't expensive. Around $7 to share 10 dishes. I don't think we left a tip, since we really didn't have a waitress/waitor.", 
      "I had lunch at Mandarin Wok once again today, and I left with happy stomach. \u00a0I ordered my favorite dish \"Braised Fish\" and 3 dim sum dishes. \u00a0Braised Fish is delicious as always, but I would be perfect with a little spice. \u00a0Food is great, but there are rooms for improvement on the decor and cleanliness.", 
      "How have i not reviewed Mandarin Wok yet? I'm a U of I alumni and this was the go to place for chinese peeps who wanted authentic yummy chinese food. I know it sounds strange that a school in the middle of corn fields could have excellent chinese food, but then again it's an engineering school so you know what that means.The fried tofu is SO GOOD here. I came back 9 years later for a reunion and the fried tofu was still amazing here. If possible, order off the mandarin menu and not the english menu. or at least say you want the \"chinese style\" and not american style dishes.yes, they make it both ways. I live in the bay area now, and i still say this is one of the best chinese restaurants I've had, and especially for the midwest! Definitely better than most places in Chicago!", 
      "YUMMY!!!!I love this place.. large enough to hold 17 girls for a big dinner party in the other room. \u00a0Crispy tofu and eggplant were the highlights of the night. \u00a0Ended up being $8 pp!!! \u00a0What a deal!", 
      "It's always fun to come here with a big group.While they offer dim sum here, which is something you can't find anywhere else around Champaign, a word of caution: their dim sum isn't all that great...For the more authentic dishes, go with the ones hand-written in Chinese on the walls. \u00a0If you're not sure what it is, don't hesitate to ask the owners... plus, you could always close your eyes, point at a random dish on the wall, and see what surprise arrives at your table (I suggest trying this only if you don't have food allergies =P)!While they do have lunch specials here, the dishes tend to be over-Americanized (like orange/sweet-sour chicken, general tsao's, etc.), but cheap.As a tip, the owners stock their kitchen on Mondays so for the freshest ingredients, try Mandarin on a Tuesday. \u00a0 Of course, that's not to say that their food is any less on other days!If you come here often enough and get to know the owners, they often throw in an extra dish or two for free =]Mandarin Wok reminds me of the Chinese restaurants back home.", 
      "Probably one of the most underrated Chinese restaurants on campus. Their dim sum is delicious! It's absolutely everything I wasn't expecting because I never hear good things about this place or no one just erally talks about it. Not only is it delicious, they have dim sum 11am-3pm EVERY day! What! Who does that! It's amazing!I had their snow pea leaves stir fried in garlic today and eggplant in garlic sauce + chicken. both were great. although, i think the snow pea leaves could've been cooked a bit more some of it was tough. The eggplant was delicious and I was looking at all the dishes around me everything looks pretty good. Forget rainbow garden - come here for real Chinese food. (And theyre not eternally grumpy like the owners at Rainbow).", 
      "This place had generally good reviews, but I had an entirely different experience. It was a very disappointing.A friend and I had decided to go because we wanted to try their dim sum. I had heard from friends that it was great. We walked in about 12:15 and did not leave until about 2:30. In my opinion, that is way too long for an hour lunch break.We walked in and it was very hectic. The waitresses were yelling and the tables were still dirty from the customers who had left. We went up to the counter to order, but she told us to sit down with our menu. We saw a bunch of people walk in and order at the counter so we filled in our sheet and brought it up. At this point it was about 12:30 before she even took our sheet because the waitress were taking care of the customers who had just walked in. So we sat there and waited, and waited and waited. 30 minutes had gone by and nothing. 40 minutes. Nothing. We were very upset because we only had a short lunch break. About 43 minutes later, our first dish came out. Slowly, our little dim sum dishes came out. One by One. Our dishes were being thrown on the table without care and the waitress just left without telling us what it was. We went up to get some hot tea as well and both containers were completely empty. We to complain and the manager said that this was a new girl and she didn't really have a handle on things yet. Our last dish came about 45 minutes later from our first dish. A few of the dim sum dishes were really tasty, but it did not make up for lack of management and service skill. I do not think that I'll ever be returning.", 
      "Went here looking for pho because I was having a huge craving for it. It's good beef pho and for a decent price as far as a big bowl goes, it was about $8 or so. Other than pho, they do have a lot of options and the ordering and serving is pretty easy. Be wary of when you order though. If you are somewhere in between lunch and dinner time, I've had problems with my friends and I getting a lunch portion when we wanted a dinner portion. But the portions are fairly priced so that's a plus.But the staff is polite and the food is good and they even have dim sum if you have cravings for it like I do.", 
      "Amazed by the variety of choices. Dim sum is available. Tasty and authentic. The only concern is the unsanitary look.", 
      "I came for the dim sum because it is the ONLY place on campus with a decent selection of it but I was VERY disappointed...VERY OVER PRICED & the SIZE IS TINYI will not be coming back here again...", 
      "The dim sum here is delicious!! I've eaten here with friends before and wasn't too impressed. It wasn't until some friends told me about the dim sum that I decided to give this place another chance and it's made me a new believer. Definitely recommend the dim sum. They serve it EVERY day from 11am-3pm!", 
      "Pretty decent dishes for the price.The usual americanized fare on the lunch menu usually lacks vegetables though--generally just your meat/tofu in sauce served with rice. \u00a0They now accept credit cards.", 
      "Clearly the best Chinese restaurant on campus. \u00a0In addition to the great food and fast service, they recently started printing the Chinese menu with translation, so you can get the good stuff without having to know chinese or use the point-at-someone's-meal-and-say-\"I'll have that\"-method.", 
      "Ohhh..how I miss this place..travelled to three cities after I moved from Champaign...this place still stands at the top....the best chinese I had in the last 5 yrs was here..never after...I have to make a trip to Champaign just for this place.", 
      "This is the best Chinese in campus-town. \u00a0Some dishes are not as good as others (such as eggplant and spinach). \u00a0I recommend the crispy tofu.", 
      "I've only been here during lunch hours, when it's almost completely empty, for their dim sum. The dim sum isn't bad for somewhere not in Chicago, but it's obvious that most of everything is frozen and re-steamed. Prices aren't bad either, about the usual prices for dim sum. They might be the only place on campus that makes real fruit slushies with boba (Evo uses syrup, yuck!). Other than that, the regular food is nothing special and rumor has it this place is closing soon since no one ever goes there anymore. But that's just a testament to the ownership and the so-so food. If you want dim sum you can always go to Saigon.", 
      "Its amazingly awesome food man..!!! My wife is obsessed with it and she loves to have it after a stressful day at work!", 
      "One of my favorite Chinese joints in college. Portions are huge, so large that I think 2 people can finish one lunch item. The menu has so many varieties of foods. I love the fried rice here...The staff is nice and they have a lot of seating to accommodate a large group. Very inexpensive and I highly recommend it!", 
      "I used to eat here very often when I was study at UIUC couple years back. However, last year I happened to visit Champaign again and want to have some of my favorite food at Mandarin wok so I stopped by here to have lunch.In my opinion, the quality as well as the taste is sooo much better when it belongs to the original owner. I was disappointed with crispy tofu that is not as good as before. I also ordered different kind of foods but nothing can compare to the one usually I had before. If you really want to try a \"real mandarin wok\" you should go to Mahomet where the original owner open a new restaurant name \"the wok\"", 
      "I took my dad there today to give him some dim-sum experience. The food was good, and was ready in a reasonable amount of time (maybe due to the fact that we came there after peak hour). Like other reviewers have mentioned, there is not really what you would normally call \"service\", you get your own tea, chop stick and clean up after yourselves. but i am fine with that. A good experience overall.", 
      "When they were under previous management, their food was great. But now it's barely passable. Their fried rice is all gummy and their noodle soups are too salty. Do yourself a favor and go to the old owners' new place -- the Wok -- in Mahomet.", 
      "I grew up in Taiwan so I know what I'm talking about. I've been to many Chinese restaurants on campus and this one is certainly the most authentic of all. I would suggest non-Chinese customers to bring a Chinese speaking friend and look at the Chinese menu instead of the English one.", 
      "Went here many times with friends while I was down at UofI. \u00a0Good portions at decent prices. \u00a0Wait is a bit long at times, but overall a great place to eat if you want to stay close to campus. \u00a0Food is good, only gave 4 stars because of wait time."

      "This place probably has the best vibe in Champaign for restaurants. Very modern interior and professional waitstaff. I've been here several times while I was out here in Champaign and none disappointed. The ramen is good, sushi is much better than any others in Champaign, and appetizers are delicious! This place will definitely be successful. It's on the higher end in terms of pricing compared to everything else on the street, but you need to treat yourself every now and then. It's on the further end of Green St, but worth the trek.Be sure to try their sushi and ramen out! Their specials have always been delicious!", 
      "Great atmosphere. Right on university campus but without too many students. The Sushi, Rolls and Ramen are great. I drank Korean rice wine and sparkling peach sake, both were delicious. The restaurant has a Korean twist on Japanese udon, making it spicy. Personally not a favorite. But I will go again for sushi, ramen and drinks.", 
      "The Sushi is very GOOD!I came with my girlfriend on a Friday night for dinner. We got there at 7 and had to wait around 20ish minutes to get a table but they had a seating system where they text you when they're ready for you so it wasn't a big deal. The Atmosphere:The restaurant itself is beautiful, modern and minimalist. It is a bit small but I personally enjoy that vibe at a sushi restaurant; it usually means that the kitchen can take the time needed to make the food for you. The Food/Drink:I was not very thrilled with the drink menu. I really wanted some nigori sake but it was $45 for a bottle, a bit much. We ended up getting a bottle of makgeolli and some beers. As for the food we got steamed gyozas (had to ask for them to be steamed because they are on the menu as fried) and 4 different sushi rolls: shrimp tempura, Philadelphia, Sakanaya, and the Windy City. We were satisfied with the gyozas and all of the rolls but especially enjoyed the sakanaya and windy city rolls, definitely a repeat order item. The fish was fresh and the rolls looked extremely appetizing the way that they were presented. The service: This is the only part of the restaurant I wasn't thrilled about. Our waitress was a bit cold and seemed like she was going out of her way every time we asked something. She could have been having a bad night so I don't think it would be fair to say the restaurant as a whole has bad service.Takeaway:All in all I will definitely make Sakanaya my go to sushi destination in Champaign/Urbana.", 
      "This place is the most unassuming little building on Green Street, so it took my roommate and me a while to try it. But man are we glad we did.The place has a really relaxed lounge-like atmosphere, and a very modern feel. There aren't a lot of tables, so there's usually a wait during dinner hours, but they take your cell phone number and text you when your table is ready. So you're free to wander around a bit if you want while you wait.The menu is admittedly a bit pricey, but the portions are generous and filling. The first time I was here, I got the bul-goki, which came with a mountain of delicious marinated beef, a salad, and a few pieces of sushi. I can eat a lot, and I still couldn't quite finish!If you have some spare cash to burn and are looking for a delicious and flavorful dinner, this is a place that should be high on your list.", 
      "My favorite Sushi place in town. I love their sashimi, sushi, they are so fresh. Tasted awesome. \u00a0Ramen is also excellent. \u00a0After eating here, it is hard for me to go to the other sushi places in town.", 
      "Holy crap. \u00a0When I came to visit my baby brother in college (where the heck is Urbana-Champaign, anyways??), I thought that I would be eating the run-of-the-mill college food. \u00a0Mentally prepared for dry burgers and overcooked pasta, I was nearly weeping with joy when I saw that there was a good sushi place.Sakanaya did not disappoint. \u00a0My brother and I had the Playgirl and the normal spicy tuna and salmon avocado rolls. \u00a0The Playgirl was DELICIOUS (how do you fit that much crunchy flavor into one bite?). \u00a0The spicy tuna also came in chunks rolling in spicy sauce, none of that nasty mayo stuff. \u00a0It was so good we practically inhaled it.It is a small restaurant, so if you come during a prime time there will be a short wait. \u00a0It was around 20 minutes for us at 6:30 PM on a Sunday, so not enough to deter me next time.Now that we discovered Sakanaya, I may be a leeetttle more inclined to come visit UIUC again. \u00a0Mmmmmm.", 
      "This restaurant impressed me with its attention to detail. Right from the get go- you have the laminate wood exterior, and the zen feel is all throughout the interior. The posh, slate colored trim and the dim oversized lightbulbs gives it an industrial flavor. You see the detail work in the silverware, menu, even the napkins... the ambiance outranks all of the other campus restaurants out there. This meticulous attention is of course given to the food. I'm a bit picky about my sushi and I can say that the sushi here is fantastic. I've had their cold noodles and ramen as well. Like the sushi, they all have a balanced composition of flavor and texture. Its definitely worth going to for a nice dinner out on campus.", 
      "Giving it 4 stars because I wish the space was bigger, but other than that everything was amazing! I'm from Chicago suburbs, so kinda picky when it comes to sushi, but sakanaya is, I think, the best in champaign! The sushi is served at room temperature which is amazing! I especially love their sashimi. It's a little pricy, so definitely don't come here all the time, but I'm so glad they opened this place up!", 
      "Nice and delicate food. Wanna try the \"I love Salmon\" next time, looks good.", 
      "It's pricey, but the environment is nice and the ramen is great! Sushi is delicious :)", 
      "Had the late night menu here a couple weeks ago. The sushi itself was good, though the portions of tuna in the nigiri seemed less generous than comparable places in town like Yellowfin or Kamakura. The service was a little bit slow, and seating is limited: there was a 20 minute wait or so to get a table, even though it was past 10PM. The sake was cheap and plentiful enough to make the wait less of a big deal. We finished off our meal with the deep-fried chicken wings from their late-night menu. Quite good! To sneak in one final nitpick, though: the place tries very hard to make itself seem like a big-city sushi joint with its ambiance, and by that I mean music was blaring pretty loud through the speakers during our meal, making it hard to carry on quiet conversation.", 
      "Good presentation, great staff and service, appropriate atmosphere, and delicious food.Try: Willis tower (worth the money), salmon lovers dish, and all the restDon't try: ramen or that fancy lobster tail shell roll I will certainly be back for my sushi fix.", 
      "Best rolls in champaign! For a good price too! Service is prompt. Wait can be pretty long (15-25 mins) during peak hours but it is worth it. I recommend the play girl rolls and spicy tonkasu ramen. Udon is good too. A must try!", 
      "Ahhh, I miss the Sakanaya roll. Barely any of the sushi places on campus offer scallop, so I immediately ordered it. It's awesome! Seared scallop with bonito flakes tops the roll and it has salmon, crab meat, and avocado (okay, so a really glorified Cali roll), but it's very tasty and presented gorgeously. It's around $14, so be ready to part with your cash! The treat is definitely worth it though.The ramen is delicious, albeit pricey. Huge portions of everything are in your ramen. My only complaint is that some of my ramen noodles had a strange. mild soapy taste. The pork broth had a strong, savory flavor, and I recommend getting the tonkotsu ramen. The slices of pork and veggies are also generous, which I really liked. It's not the best ramen I've ever had, so I don't think the price is warranted. The interior is very small and a bit cramped when it's full of people coming in and out, so be ready to be bumped a bit or squeeze by people at dinner. However, the staff are polite and do their best to stay organized; they use an iPad system to keep track of orders and tables, and they wait in the back or to the side while on standby to avoid collisions. I think it's considerate because the wait might take a while (even with a reservation), so you can walk around on Green Street and they'll call you when a table opens up.So far it's the only place on campus that has good ramen, so I suppose I could say I'm a fan.", 
      "We thought the food was wonderful. Hot, spicy flavorful Ramen. HOWEVER, the egg wa totally overcooked which seemed like such a shame. The water jars with the definition of water on the side of the bottle gave us a little chuckle so I will still give this place four stars, mainly because the food was basically amazing. The egg though. Shameful.", 
      "As a huge fan of sushi and sashimi, i thought this place was okaythe ambience is 10/10 and the drinks are amazing.i was not impressed by the $20 ramen that was yes, full of other things, BUT the noodles still tasted like the packaged ones :(if it was $10 i would not be complaining, but they ask far too much money for the lack of taste (ok so i guess its fine if you dont know anything about food)the sashimi was cut into very short pieces, making me feel like i was getting half of what i paid for. the flying fish roe was perfect though.yeah they have cute water bottle and stuff, but i feel like this places sells the look more than the food. if they worked harder on their flavour, i would be a huge fan.unfortunately i'm the kind of girl who wants to see what you can do rather than how you look, so 3 stars for me(dont get me wrong, i understand the cost of decorating and operating a business this nice. it's cute and it comes out of your wallet. i just go out for food, not to stare at walls)", 
      "Lovely. Best sushi on campus, though the ramen is a bit overpriced. Clean interior, polite staff though a bit of a wait. I recommend the salmon platter for some simple but well executed sushi. The hand roll? Work of art. Owners are lovely as well, often doubling up as waiters.", 
      "SO and I are looking for a go to sushi place in this barren wasteland called Chambana. And boy did we find one.The Good:-The Sakanaya roll was salmon, crab salad, avocado on the inside and it was topped with torched scallops and fish flakes. It was extremely good, the fish flakes brought an interesting twist to it, great texture,-Blue-fin tuna sashimi. Our waiter recommended the current special, which was priced at 2.5 per piece. Neither my SO or I particularly like sashimi, but we both loved it, it was fantastic.-The miso soup was just the right amount \u00a0saltiness and fantastic flavor.-We also got the Una-Q roll and the Salmon roll, and both were well really well wrapped and delicious. The eel in the Una-Q roll melts in your mouth.-The ambiance! It's exactly what we were looking for, upscale but still casual. Fantastic.-The service is also fantastic! Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable. The Bad:NOTHING!Overall:Absolutely fantastic. We will be back again soon, I guarantee it.", 
      "This place was very delicious and overall a great experience. They have very exotic and traditional food! I got sushi and my dad got a sea urchin!! What's really awesome is that all of their fish is wild-caught and not farm raised!!! The place is tiny but very beautiful, clean, inviting and the staff is very nice! We were in and out within an hour, but keep in mind we did get there right when it opened so it wasn't very busy. I've heard that when it's busy you'll be waiting a loooong time. Overall a pretty awesome place!", 
      "You get what you pay for. Quality of the fish is amazing for f47king central Illinois. Decor and ambiance is nice. Best part of Sakanaya was the service of the hostess. Incredibly helpful.", 
      "I ate here a few weeks ago by myself on a Friday night. \u00a0Yes, I am that guy who doesn't mind going out to eat by myself. \u00a0The staff and atmosphere were great and the sushi was amazingly fresh.I ordered the dumplings, a couple pieces of shushimi (salmon and blue fin tuna) and a roll. \u00a0I also ordered the most amazing sake. \u00a0The sake was chilled in ice and had cucumber added to it. \u00a0It tasted like cucumber water and was so smooth, which is dangerous since it contains 19% alcohol. \u00a0I liked everything so much that I ordered another round of everything excluding the dumplings. \u00a0My final bill came out to $80, but it was well worth it. \u00a0I can't wait to be back in town to try another round.", 
      "I've been looking for Japanese cuisine restaurant at UIUC for the recent two weeks. It's a great place to visit if u wanna have sth special here", 
      "Oh wow, an actual ramen place on campus. Who would have thought? People complaining about the price of ramen obviously have not had their share of ramen to know pricing. It's about what you'll pay at any restaurant, except maybe street vendors or whatnot. Anyways, the ramen is decent, not amazing. It's probably the best you'll find on campus. What makes the ramen? The broth. Being the snob I am, I asked for a little bit of each ramen's broth but was told that they make the broth with each bowl of ramen. Hmm. Some flags when up there. Regardless, I tried both the soy based and chicken based broths and found there was really nothing special about either of them. Again, if you're looking for ramen this place is the best bet, but don't expect anything spectacular.The sushi was what I was more impressed with, as every single place on campus was disappointing me (apart from Cheese and Crackers who imports their fish overnight) but the fish was surprisingly fresh and they gave me considerable chunks of fish for my nigiri. Delicious white tuna by the way.I'd definitely go back for the sushi. If they ever change the ramen or I'm super desperate for some at 2:00 AM or something I'll give this place another try.*Also there were little things I really liked about the place like the atmosphere, the little pipettes they use for soy sauce, and especially the fact that they give you an entire jug of water for your table.", 
      "I went there last week and the food was amazing. I haven't had much sushi in life but this was great. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. I wasnt so sure of which sake to have and the server gave me a nice description of each of them and helped me choose one.", 
      "I visited U of I recently and was looking for a place to eat on green st. since it was within walking distance from my friend's apartment. 4 stars for this place and something I hadn't been to before, sounds good to me. I was a little hesitant though since there were no elite reviews and some of the reviews seem like fakes, but here's mine. Hopefully you can trust me.I walked in and it looks really nice, nice decorations and everything, just really small. Put our name in and waited probably 20 minutes or so to be seated. People love their sushi on a Saturday night I guess. I recommend calling for a reservation, and don't plan on coming if you have more that 4 people since there's barely enough tables as is. From what I read, the ramen was pretty good. My friend told me that too and the waiter said that's what they were known for so that sounded good to me. The gf and I both got ramen, forgot what their names were though. We did have different broths though and I liked mine better. Hers was the first one listed and mine was the second. I'm definitely a fan of this. I usually don't like ramen since you can pay 10 cents and make it in the microwave as opposed to paying 13 bucks for this one, but this was good. Meat was even tender and the dish as a whole was pretty solid.We also ordered a sakanaya roll which was recommended by our waiter. Guess the sushi was backed up since it took a while for it to get out to us. To be honest I wasn't really a fan. Tasted fine but wasn't anything special. It was room temperature, so it just makes me think that it was sitting out for a while, but hey that may be your cup of tea, who knows. But anyway, 4 stars for the ramen dishes pretty much.", 
      "I've been sitting on this review for a while, mulling it over. \u00a0My husband and I went here a month or so ago right at opening time. \u00a0By the time we were seated, there were already people waiting to get in. \u00a0Seems like people were as excited by Sakanaya as we were. \u00a0Aside from the pop-up ramen nights that happen from time to time, there hasn't been a place in town to get real ramen. \u00a0I'm sad to say that I'm still waiting for a good ramen place.The ambiance in Sakanaya is really really impressive, especially remembering what Sushi Avenue (the restaurant formerly in this location) used to look like. \u00a0Very nice date-night atmosphere with low lights and a beautiful interior. \u00a0However, that kind of thing factors in pretty low on my set of priorities. \u00a0My husband and I both ordered a bowl of ramen. \u00a0They're pretty huge, easily a meal by itself or more than that if you haven't got a big appetite. \u00a0However, at $12-$13 it was overpriced. \u00a0The noodles were sticking to each other (like they'd been sitting around for a while cooling), and the broth had no depth of flavor. \u00a0At first bite the broth's flavor was quite good, but as I got closer to the end of the bowl I realized how completely unremarkable it was. \u00a0The pork slices were good, but not great, and the hardboiled egg was nothing special, either. \u00a0Additionally, I found the inclusion of corn baffling and off-putting. \u00a0I would pay maybe $8 or $9 for this ramen. \u00a0At Mitsuwa up near Chicago, $10 buys a pretty remarkable bowl of ramen from the Santouka shop, and that is my frame of reference for this meal.We also got a couple pieces of sushi with our meal which were about on-par with our other favorite places in town, Sushi Kame and Yellowfin. \u00a0In short, the sushi is good but a bit more expensive than other places in town, and the ramen would be serviceable if it cost about $4 less. \u00a0I think you will like this place if you don't mind paying a bit more for a fancy atmosphere, but I probably won't be back.", 
      "Really pleasantly surprised. First class sushi, right on campus, in central Illinois? Amazing! The decor is really nice, the service is top notch and most importantly - the fish / sushi itself is really great quality. We had some miso soup, hot sake, a couple of specialty sushi rolls (Sakanaya and OMG), a classic spicy tuna and shrimp tempura. Everything was delicious, fresh and well presented. This is certainly the best sushi place in town!", 
      "Came here for dinner on a Friday evening. It's a little small, so prepare to wait at prime dining hours. We had the sakanaya and kamikaze rolls and fatty salmon to share. The sakanaya roll was particularly good- crab, avocado, and salmon, topped with scallop and fish flakes. Really, really good. One of the better sushi rolls I've had at any sushi place. Both rolls were nicely presented. Fatty salmon is my weakness, and Sakanaya's is very expensive per piece ($9!) but it was pretty worth it tonight. While it wasn't the best piece I've ever had, it was still melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you ever get the chance, you need to try fatty salmon! For the rest of our meal, we had tonkatsu ramen. I have to say, I wasn't blown away by the ramen. I'd give it three stars. The broth was the right color and consistency, but it really lacked the richness and pork flavor that tonkatsu ramen should have. It just tasted a little thin and bland. Definitely need to work on that. The noodles themselves were nice and chewy, so no complaints about that. Meat was tasty, but cut pretty thin. Thumbs down for the egg, which was hard boiled and cold... Skimpy on the bamboo shoots. I was happy about the noodles, but the rest of the ramen was just okay. Overall, I'd give Sakanaya 3.5 stars. The sushi is great but I think the ramen could be improved a lot. I'd love to explore the rest of the menu some time. I'll definitely be back, at least for sushi!", 
      "I loved absolutely everything about eating here. The sushi is the best I've had, and far superior than other restaurants in Champaign. I know other people say that the ramen may be overpriced, but the portions are huge and delicious. I love the interior and all the little details they took into consideration (the glasses, the authentic wood pieces)...The service was also amazing. You must try the Korean soju! the most unique drink I've ever had!", 
      "Definitely make sure to show up early. The tables filled up quick when they opened up for dinner hours at 5pm.I ordered the Bulgoki and my friend ordered the Miso Ramen. The Bulgoki was visually pleasing. I had never gotten Bulgoki with a side salad, two sushi pieces, and two pieces of crispy tofu. I felt like it was worth the price for what I got. I've spent about $12 for Bulgogi at other restaurants, but it was only the meat and rice. So Sakanaya gave a nice addition. I also thought it was a good way to still put a little Japanese influence in the dish. For the Miso Ramen, it was tasty. It was a big bowl of Ramen definitely not something you can find elsewhere on Green St. The pork was very tender and the broth just made it taste better.Overall, it was a good food night. I definitely recommend Sakanaya if you want a nice place to go for dinner. The food's taste matches the decor: awesome.", 
      "I give it a decent rating bc the place is just too pretty and the servers super nice. However, the ramen was just ok, nothing special. Thats the only thing I had besides the octapus which was also not bad. Leaves a lot to be desired tho.", 
      "Went at dinner time with a friend. My Sakanaya roll was ok. Nothing impressive. For a 15 dollar roll I expect a little more flavor. Her 6 dollar California roll actually tasted a lot better than mine. The atmosphere's nice. I love the decoration and design. I'll probably come back to try a different roll. So far I still think the lunch eel roll is the best. I guess I'll stick to lunch now", 
      "Yummy food and reasonable prices. Cute decoration and dishes. They had some special and different sushi rolls that are worth a try. I liked everything about this place and strongly recommend it if you want to have fresh and delicious sushi.", 
      "Brilliant. Really took care of our 5 and 6 year old kids. Food was excellent as was the Saki.", 
      "Just dined here with my husband and our friend, and everything was top to bottom delicious. Certainly it seems like there's a vocal minority at work here. No bother, here is what you need to know: The miso ramen was simply perfect. Everything about it, the balance of flavor, the portion size, the doneness of the noodles --\u00a0perfect. I had a tempura shrimp roll, and it was 7 pieces deep, all big and overflowing with everything you'd want in a roll. But let's talk about the fact that the ownership actually put some care and attention to the details about the way this place looks. Fact is, humans are very much moved by their environment, and Sakanaya designed this place to be an experience. I will gladly pay the prices on the menu to eat this type of fare in a really beautiful space. All others can hit up Panda Express. Enjoy. Nice work, Sakanaya. Really impressive. We'll be back, time and time again.", 
      "Don't listen to these bozos who are giving this place static.Sakanaya is absolutely delicious, from the sushi, to the ramen, to the nigiri -- and the service was spectacular. The wait? Yeah. Big deal. It's dinner at a place people actually want to eat. The prices? Yeah, decent food actually costs a few bucks, especially when it's served to you and you don't have to bus your own table. Three cheers for Sakanaya!", 
      "Good sushi. Great atmosphere and attention to detail with everything from the cups to soy sauce bottles. One of my new favorite spots on Green St!The one issue is that it's tiny so there may be a wait.", 
      "A good sushi restaurant in Central Illinois? Yeah, I had my doubts too. But Sakanaya is here to make you a believer. This coming from a Southern CA native. \u00a0The fish was fresh and the rolls were inventive. Looking forward to trying the ramen next time!", 
      "FINALLY. I've been waiting for Urbana-Champaign to open up a Japanese ramen shop and one has finally opened. With an extensive menu of appetizers, fresh sashimi, sushi rolls, shoyu + miso ramen, and other korean dishes, you will definitely have to take some time to look over the menu. I would have to say that the sushi was the freshest I've ever tasted in Urbana-Champaign. Being from Florida, my standards for sushi are a bit high and have been disappointed over the past 2.5 years I have been living in the CU, but Sakanaya does not disappoint. Location is ideal as it is right on Green Street, the heart of the UofI campus. Parking can be hectic though. ($0.75/hr) Parking is free after 9pm and free on Sundays. There was a line the entire time we were there, but service was fast and friendly, so the line was constantly moving. Also, we went after opening day. The interior and exterior is very appealing, but the inside is a bit smaller than I would have imagined. The tables are pretty close to each other. The man next to our table was sitting alone, listening on our conversation and occasionally talked to us. Prices are a bit more expensive than I thought. Since it is catering to mostly college students, thinking of one's budget, the ramen bowl would've been nice at $8, instead of the $12. Portion size is good - shared a shoyu ramen bowl and kamakazi (sushi roll) with a friend and we were satisfied. (But there was still room left for dessert.) Ramen broths are pork-based. The pork melts in your mouth and the broth isn't too salty or bland - just right. It was a bit lukewarm though, but that's just preference. I like my soups really hot. The salmon on the kamakazi was really soft and melted in your mouth too. Definitely fresh. Tl;dr? - Sushi and ramen are good. Get it. - Atmosphere is romantic. Definitely a date night kind-of place. - Worth the experience/trip, not worth the price. Would've been better if it was $4 cheaper. Where else can you buy authentic Japanese ramen here, anyway?", 
      "This is by far the best sushi place in Champaign. It explains why there's usually a line outside the door of this classy establishment. Keep in mind that Japanese restaurants tend to sacrifice quantity for quality and at Sakanaya, you are definitely paying for high quality food. The lunch and dinner menus are different and note that the lunch menu has lunch specials if you're looking to save some money. I hope they release their menu online sometime in the future."

      "I was extremely impressed with my overall experience here. Price is reasonable. Food is seriously delicious and everything seems to be made with fresh ingredients. The biggest thing that impressed me was the attention to detail. I ordered the spicy green curry with shrimp and I noticed that they cut off the shell of the shrimp all the way down to the tail, making it easier for you to eat the entire shrimp without having to dig out the meat.Also FYI, the \"hot\" is really really spicy. I ate the entire thing but went through 5 napkins of sweat. I can't imagine what fire hot is like", 
      "I've had good experiences in the past but it really sucked tonight. I ordered delivery through GrubHub. They said it would be an hour. It ended up being an hour and 45 minutes. When I complained to GrubHub they called the manager and were told that it wasn't that late and basically didn't care. The egg drop soup was really bad -- they obviously had rushed because the eggs weren't scrambled so there were huge chunks of egg white and yolk. Gross. Food was a decent temperature and the delivery driver was really nice/apologetic. It's a gamble as to if it's going to be really good or sort of a disaster.", 
      "This place has great food! \u00a0I love their Kung Pao Chicken lunch special comes with fried rice and eggroll for $6-something. \u00a0It looks like a hole in the wall type place, but really does have awesome food! \u00a0Check it out!", 
      "Their Pad Thai is delicious! I asked for less oily but more spicy today and they did it nicely without compromising the taste. You can try the curry as well.", 
      "I have ordered twice now from here and both times good food. but one complaint is the drench of sauce they do. i pick up my order and theirs sauce all over when i take it out the bag at homeMongolian beef and the pepper steak are good dish", 
      "The food is good and has all the flavor you'd want in your Thai dish, but you'd definitely be mislead by the outside decor. The yimein an the noodles dishes are definitely something to taste. For the price, it's definitely a good deal, worth the trip.", 
      "It's... Okay... I don't understand why Korean people on this campus are obsessed with Golden Wok. Sh*t isn't f8+king Holy water. I would give the food 2 stars but the owner is so friendly: 3 stars.", 
      "Yum yum yum delicious! Vegetarian friendly (except look out for fish sauce). I am always craving this place. Everything I've tried is delicious and is all a great value! If you're looking for fancy pants atmosphere, take it to-go somewhere and light some candles (what I do)! Some of my favorites:-I know everyone says this, but it's true that the pad thai is up there with the best I've had!-Basil eggplant-Broccoli in garlic sauce-Vegetable egg rolls-Yellow curry with veggies and tofu (they usually load it up pretty well)-Papaya salad is a nice fresh raw change from your usual saucy Asian dishes-Pad see ew-Hot and sour soup-You can add tofu to anything for a dollar or something, so I usually do that", 
      "Delivery was much faster than the \"45-60 minutes\" as advertised. The fried rice was too spicy for my wife. The duck in the rice was full of gristle and bone. It also was overcooked way more than delivery should be. (I know delivery will always be a little overcooked.) The crab rangoon was soggy and gross and there was very little filling. The filling that we could taste in the rangoon was, at best, ok. It might have been better, but the outside was so gross that we didn't taste the filling too much. My wife spit it out in her napkin (she never does this). Not again.", 
      "There are so many great things about this place. \u00a0I've dined in and had no issues. \u00a0Food was great. \u00a0I've ordered over the phone from my office and picked it up on the way home, and I've also ordered for delivery.The good is great. \u00a0I'd say it's the best yellow curry in town. \u00a0The employees are always nice.", 
      "This place is still my favorite pad thai place. \u00a0It's got some flavors in there that I feel that other Thai places are lacking.But let's talk about the duck fried rice. \u00a0Though I do like the pad thai more than the duck fried rice, I feel that this deserves some special mentioning. \u00a0It is delicious and is one of the best fried rice dishes that I've ever had. \u00a0They pretty much took the chopped up roast duck that you'd typically find at Chinese stores and made fried rice with it. \u00a0All the duck grease melds with the rice and it is awesome. \u00a0Oh yeah, being chopped up means that there's bone in there too... to be careful about that.Regardless, this is yet another must visit if you're in this area.", 
      "Golden Wok is the best place to get your fill of Thai food on the U of I Campus.It's cheap and the staples are great. The pad thai and the pad se-ew are filling and hit the spot. It never hurts to try the Thai iced tea as well.Though Golden Wok occupies a pretty small area, it never gets too busy.", 
      "Judging from its exterior (stale yellow wood siding, shady parking lot), I was sure I'd never eat at Golden Wok. \u00a0I was even more suspicious of their advertisement of combined Thai and Chinese cooking. \u00a0However, as I passed by one day, I noticed that the outside window declared that they served Hainan chicken rice, a traditional delicacy rarely mentioned outside of larger urban areas. \u00a0I gave it a try, and now I swear by Golden Wok for my Thai cravings.Champaign diners go nuts for the pad thai here. \u00a0I'm also a fan of this popular noodle dish, but for my review, I'd like to pay homage to another favorite dish from this modest little store: the tom kha kai.The tom kha kai soup comes in generous portions, with lots of chicken, soft mushrooms, bright chili flakes, slices of scallion, and a few pieces of ginger and lemongrass (shouldn't eat those last two, but at least they're testaments to the broth's beautiful flavor). \u00a0Soups at Golden Wok are spooned over jasmine rice instead of noodles. \u00a0This dish easily served as 3 meals for me, and is irresistible given its price ($7.35).", 
      "Had to up this to five stars because everything I eat from here is fantastic. I could eat here everyday and be happy. Just tried the fried rice... Best in town.", 
      "This is the best place to get pad thai. \u00a0Really good flavor. \u00a0They give you A LOT and it's not that expensive because it's not table service. \u00a0Their curries are not bad either. \u00a0I would recommend the Penang or the one that starts with a M.I only gave it four stars because I know that their lunch specials (the ones that are specifically Chinese) are not always good. \u00a0Plus, if you go in the summer.. it can be kind of hot. \u00a0I have yet to try their beef noodle soups... but I am sure it's good.", 
      "Totally my favorite Chinese spot on campus! They offer so much food and just pile it on till the container gives out. Quality/Quantity? Who really cares when you're in college. I appreciate the drive through aspect of this restaurant and they do have a nice daily lunch special for when I can't decide. The owners have always been really nice and throw in a few egg rolls for me and my boyfriend. Try the Mongolian Beef as stereotypical as it sounds. The beef is tender, the veggies crunchy for the most part if you get it at the right time of day and for less than $10 a day, you can feed two college students. How much better can it get?", 
      "Golden Wok is one of those small niche restaurants in Champaign. It doesn't get a huge amount of foot traffic through it and is located on the border of one of the sketchier areas in Champaign, but the food is good for what you pay for. A typical entree might be $8-9 (which is expensive for Champaign IMO). But you also do get lots of food. My favorite dish here is Beef Pad See Ewe which is the long noodles with broccoli, bok choy, and beef. Put a little siracha sauce on it and you have a really tasty dish.The restaurant is family owned and they seem to be there all the time. They are really good about phone orders and being fairly quick about bringing dishes out, though sometimes they might forget something. You just have to have thick skin when going into the place, because you might not get the best service.The downside of this place is that it just seems a little bit dirty. The tables are a bit grimey even after they wipe them down. And you have to clean up everything yourself. But the family is super nice and the food is good and there really is no Thai place like it in the Champaign-Urbana area.Other popular dishes I see people get are:Pad ThaiRed CurryGreen CurryI give it 3.5 stars, but not enough to round up to 4 on the food alone.", 
      "I've already rated you guys thru grubhub, but you guys just don't let up so i gotta come here too. \u00a0Chicken Pad Thai is SO good, order it HOT, but not FIRE HOT :) \u00a0next time i'll ask for extra lime wedges. \u00a0Egg rolls are super good too. \u00a0I've never eaten at your store, but all your food is delivered piping hot. \u00a0Egg rolls are the thing; most places, they're cold by the time they arrive. \u00a0Yours are always hot. \u00a0Actually had to wait last time because my first bite burned my mouth. \u00a0Also, you have the good hot mustard packets; no one i've ordered from in town in the past has good hot mustard. \u00a0Wish i hadn't taken so long to discover your place. \u00a0I always order thru grubhub, which is probably not that smart, and when you guys showed up there, i had to give you a try. \u00a0You are the best! \u00a0Two things i wish you would do: \u00a0i would like to try something new, like one of the curries, but there are no descriptors either on your website or grubhub. \u00a0what the heck is \"Jungle Curry\"?? \u00a0it has to be good, but i'd like to know what i'm getting into first. \u00a0only other thing is that the sign you have on your website says \"Golden Work\". \u00a0while i'm sure it is work to make such tasty food, you should probably change it to \"Wok\"...EDIT: \u00a0i really used to like this place, but it seems like they pretty consistently get my order wrong and ignore my requests. \u00a0ordered chicken pad thai FIRE HOT and it was very bland. \u00a0egg roll and golden shrimp roll were tepid and not crunchy. \u00a0i always request hot mustard and chopsticks, and, outside of one or two times, they don't include them. \u00a0i'm sure it would be easy enough to correct if i was eating at their store, but i order delivery exclusively. \u00a0won't be ordering from them again probably. \u00a0they dropped the ball once too many for me.", 
      "This is my favorite place to get pad thai in Champaign. It's incredibly yummy and a good deal considering how much they give you. \u00a0I can usually eat it for lunch and still have more than enough for dinner. Their Thai Iced tea is also worth the $2.10 price. The food also comes out pretty fast. Try to stop by during their lunch specials. It's an entree, fried rice, and an eggroll. Their fried rice is ridiculously good and their eggroll is perfect... they're stuffed with noodles inside.", 
      "I love this place! I've eaten at Golden Wok about twice a month for the last 2 years, and keep coming back for more. However, it is worth mentioning that I mostly come for lunch, and almost always get the kung pao beef for lunch - $7 for a large portion of beef, rice, and an eggroll? That's a great deal if you ask me! At dinner, my favorite item there is the masaman chicken curry, with lots of prik nam pla on top.", 
      "Pad thai, pad see ew? Well here's probably one of the best places to go in champaign for it. Prices are average, but you can ask for double noodle for around 1.5 dollars more which really makes the portion of the dish extremely sufficient for hungrier people. Going to have to say that the double noodle makes this place extremely worth it and definitely my favorite thai place in urbana / champaign.", 
      "Had duck fried rice which was full of small crunchy bones. The cashew chicken had a funky odor and the pad thai was horrible. Not to mention the restaurant is dirty and condiment bottles are crusty. This place is overpriced for poor quality food. We will not be going back!", 
      "I was pleasantly surprised!The other two Thai restaurants in the area which I have eaten at were closed so I decided to give the Golden Wok a try due to its good reviews on yelp. This place is really easy to miss because it is a tiny building that does not look anything like a Thai restaurant.The restaurant was completely empty when we got there but while we were eating there was a steady stream of people coming in to order take out. We ordered the Tom Yun Koong, Yum Nuau, and Jungle Curry.Tom Yun Koong is a soup that is exactly the same as the traditional Tom Yum soup found at all Thai restaurants and it came with shrimp. \u00a0The soup was delicious, but definitely not the best I have ever had. It had the prefect amount of heat, the shrimp were not overcooked, and the vegetables were nice and crispy.Yum Nuau is a spicy beef salad. I always order this dish when i go to a Thai restaurant and I have to admit that this salad had some sort of different spice which was very tasty. Again, it was not the best I have ever had but it was deliciously unique. All the vegetables in the salad were super fresh and the quality of the beef was excellent. Jungle Curry was very confusing though. It came in a big bowl with a ton of fresh vegetables and wonderfully seasoned chicken but the sauce was some sort of chicken broth with seasonings. I thought that they brought me the wrong dish but sure enough it was the Jungle \"curry\" that I had ordered. This was the first time I was served a curry dish which did not consist of coconut milk. It was very tasty though and I was not disappointed that I ordered it. In the future I will definitely always ask for the ingredients in the dish before I order it. \u00a0One other complaint was that the menus are very simple and do not have pictures or any sort of description of the dishes. This would be nice but not a big huge deal.The service was excellent and the people working there are very friendly.I would definitely recommend this place.", 
      "Food was priced average ($8-12), and my order came quick. This place is more of a counter order restaurant, so it's almost serve yourself. Anyway, my order came very fast, within a few minutes. The veggie and sauce mix was really tasty, but the meat (I ordered a chicken dish) was not too good. \u00a0In fact, it tasted like turkey. \u00a0I probably will not go here again. \u00a0Also, the workers have a hard time speaking English. It was hard to understand them, and I was note sure my order was being communicated correctly to them. \u00a0The restaurant is also really tiny. \u00a0Don't let it scare you away though. \u00a0Try it out, it might suit your fancy.", 
      "The chicken pad thai here is a staple for me. The only downside? University Ave. is a bit off campus, especially in the northwest corner. However, the food is savory and perfectly seasoned, not to mention they always have siracha at every table in their cafeteria-style restaurant. Brought my dad here one time, and he really enjoyed the pad thai. I have also ordered and enjoyed the green curry here. Pretty authentic, given they use several authentic ingredients, including the green gourd-like vegetables in the stock. Great food, great price, not so great location.", 
      "This place does Thai noodle dishes well (I never venture away from Pad See Ew, but their other choices also look good). \u00a0The food is reasonably priced and comes in large portions. \u00a0It's located in a weird part of town, but if you like good food it shouldn't matter. \u00a0The staff are very welcoming, and the food is prepared fast.", 
      "Y'know how sometimes in life we learn lessons in our heads but it never really hits home until much later?The mantra of \"never judge a book by its cover\" became real to me the first time I dined at Golden Wok. It was a scene worthy of a movie - dramatic music, slow-mo closeups of pad thai flying everywhere, and fat tears of epiphany rolling down my cheeks to salt up my food. Not that the food needed any more salt or additional seasoning anyway. In direct contrast to the squat (one could even go so far as to call it ugly) exterior, the dishes are pure decadence in your mouth. Yes, the pad thai is awesome but people, let's stroll down some paths less taken, shall we? Pad see ew is also good, though in my opinion, perhaps a bit too much sauce. My favorites would have to be the Golden Fried Rice (offered only on their Shining White Board of Specials) and the Beef Noodle Soup. The Golden Fried Rice is curried, pineappled, raisined, egged goodness. Sounds weird but the lesson here is \"never judge a book by its cover\", remember? The Beef Noodle Soup is perhaps a direct cousin of Vietnamese pho. I've never been quite sure whether to go ahead and give it the pho label because it just never seems quite..... pho-y enough. But irregardless of labels, its exactly what I find myself ordering when it's blizzarding and I just want some hot broth and flavorful noodles to fill me up. The curries are also excellent. Hell, just go ahead and order everything. I'm pretty sure you can't lose.Could it get any better? Why yes, it can, rhetorical question asker. With giant portion sizes! Unless you're of the same breed as some of my male bottomless-pit friends, be prepared for leftovers. Advice: noobs should go with an experienced G-Woker. It's a hidden gem - emphasis on hidden.", 
      "I decided to try Golden Wok after a bit of a vacation from greasy Thai food, but the management as well as the food quality appears to have changed. \u00a0I have never had worse Tom Kha until I had the misfortunate of eating there last week.", 
      "The best pad thai in town!! The curries are also pretty good. Flavor wise, I would rank this one as No. 1 Thai restaurant in Chambana.", 
      "I totally agree with Allan and Countess that they make really good pad thai. Best in CU! The noodles are cooked al dente, not soggy like other places and the flavors are rightly balanced. It is a must-try!", 
      "Ah Golden Wok...this place has never dissapointed me. \u00a0Great place to get noodles, as others have mentioned. \u00a0While I was down at UofI, I tried many of the dishes and was never dissatisfied. \u00a0Their Pad Thai is no joke, and a killer deal if you get the lunch special. \u00a0Other items on the menu are great as well. \u00a0I've had Pad Kee Mao, Red Curry with Chicken, Shrimp Rolls, Shezhuan Shrimp, Kung Pao Shrimp and some others I can't recall of the top of my head (we ordered a huge family style meal once), but everything was great! \u00a0Make sure you also try the Thai Iced Tea (easy on the ice) as well. \u00a0On top of great food, the service is great! \u00a0The people there are very friendly. \u00a0If that wasn't enough to convince you to check this place out, this may say something: \u00a0When I graduated, I took my family (including aunts and uncles) all to this place after the ceremony, and they were all very happy with the food and service (many of them have eaten at '5 star' restaurants on business trips)Next time I am down in Champaign, I am going to get some Pad Thai from here.", 
      "This isn't the worst place for pad Thai, and trust me, I've been almost everywhere in town for it. My biggest complaint is this place is so dirty. I was afraid to drink the water, but thats just me. However, their Thai iced tea is pretty good. I can't say that I would go here again, but it was worth a try. \u00a0Also, this place is pretty cheap( around $8 or so)", 
      "Graduated from UofI in 2005 and i still get cravings for this place...that may strike you as odd, but I know plenty of other alums who have the same problem. I recently got to go back to CU and of course had to make a stop, I think the prices may haev gone up a little bit, though i can't really remember. (Beef Pad Thai for about $8-9). Regardless, it was just as good as i remember.", 
      "Red Curry... I ask for spicy. \u00a0It arrives hot, tasty, and Spicy. \u00a0I use to come to this spot when I lived down the street 10 or so years ago. \u00a0I\"m back in town, and happy that it's still kicking out the jams. \u00a0Pho is also pretty amazing.", 
      "Really the best pad thai in champaign. It took me awhile to find a place with Pad Thai that looked like it was supposed to and this was the place! Their food is delicious and the owner is super friendly. I had some of their other noodle soups and it was fantastic! I have nothing to complain about. This was the place I've been looking for since I came here for school. This is what i miss! I miss REAL Thai and Chinese food and Golden Wok is excellent!", 
      "My fiance's best friend is off the boat from thailand and knows the best little asian restaurants. When we were in town visiting him, he took us here on the way to a movie just for a quick bite to eat. Huge portions and very low prices. It seems like a family-owned business and they put their heart and soul into serving the customer. I wish more places like this existed.", 
      "Been here so many times. It became one of my to-go joint every time I go home from my clinicals. Love their Pad thai and Pho! The Pho is a little different in this place, its has more flavor in it than any other pho I've tasted, probably because of the celery. (Yes, celery) Best thai ice tea in town hands down!! I enjoy their Mongolian beef and Tom Yum soup as well! I love the service, they serve their food pretty quick. The only thing I'm concern about is the tray area is a tad filthy and they could've clean the area more often than leave plates their for some time. But who gives a damn... they got the best food ever!", 
      "The other yelpers are right: Golden Wok has THE best pad thai around (and it's not even a thai restaurant, it's \"chinese/thai,\" a combination I usually stay far far away from). \u00a0Correction: Golden Wok has the best pad thai EVER. \u00a0And yes, this is comparing it against not only the local places, but also every thai restaurant I've ever been to, and I've been to plenty. \u00a0The reason why their pad thai is so good is because of the flavoring: A lot of other Thai places either don't have enough of it, or they have so much that it's overly sweet and/or salty and it becomes so cloying I can't ever bear to finish it. \u00a0Golden Wok's pad thai, on the other hand, is done so well I finished it very quickly in one sitting...and as others have said, their portions are VERY generous. \u00a0Besides the flavor, the noodles are also done well, not mushy and stuck together, and not undercooked, and overall the dish isn't too oily either. \u00a0Four stars for the delicious pad thai all on its own; I haven't tried anything else there but we'll see how that goes...like I said, I usually stay away from \"chinese/thai\" places, but I feel like Golden Wok has earned my respect, if nothing else for their pad thai.They have their own lot, so parking isn't as bad as it is on campus. \u00a0Look out for the small yellowish standalone building; it's easy to drive past it.", 
      "The reviews here are spot on. \u00a0The best pad thai in C-U if not the best pad thai that I've had period. \u00a0I remember eating here my freshman year when my cousin brought me here. \u00a0I had a craving for some pad thai, so I decided to come here again. \u00a0Ordered an order of shrimp pad thai. \u00a0I usually order beef pad thai wherever I go, but I decided I would try something different. \u00a0Very large portion, easily enough for two meals. \u00a0Great flavors as well. \u00a0My only gripe is that they left the tails on the shrimp, so I was faced with the option of picking them off, which is a pain or just eating the tails on. \u00a0I went with the latter, which wasn't a big issue, but still undesirable. \u00a0Next time I'll be ordering beef pad thai.", 
      "Mmm good. The various noodles they have are must gets! They also have excellent curries. If you are on campus, this place is a great buy. The building may be small and seem a bit dinky, but the food is excellent. I go here often and it is often one of my \u00a0go to's when I am eating out."

      "Having been to almost every asian restaurant around champaign-urbana, I must say that bangkok thai is both my favorite and the place i frequent the most. \u00a0The pho is unbelievable. I go here more than twice a week for lunch. \u00a0Basically this place is super cheap, has great quality food, is at a convenient location, and your food is always prepared quickly.", 
      "Absolutely love this place and would give 5 stars for the pho. The broth is incredibly tasty and it always comes out tasting amazing. Believe me when I say it warms your soul. However, I'm not really a fan of the Thai food. I had the Pad Ke Mao when it was the daily special and the noodles were mushy and lacked vegetables. But this could have been they were rushing and had pre cooked the noodles because of the high demand for pad ke mao that day? The store owners are incredibly friendly and the food comes out super fast. Definitely \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a cheap, delicious, hidden gem on green street and deserves to be checked out!", 
      "Best Thai food in Champaign! It's pretty hidden in regards to street view and I wish I had tried it sooner. Hands down the best Pad Thai I've ever had. Fair warning though, regarding the spice scale they really mean it. Spicy means SPICY! The Pad See Ewe is also really good. This is a great place to go if you're looking for a moderately priced meal and leftovers for later (the portions are HUGE).", 
      "This is definitely the restaurant I want to go to any time of the week. The food is delicious and the service is very fast. Though the Pad Thai is the more popular choice for most people, I recommend the Pad Kee Mao (listed under the Friday special). It uses large rice noodles (about twice the size of Pad See Yu) and has a wider variety of vegetables. It's also much more savory and filling-- I can eat twice as much Pad Thai than Pad Kee Mao and still be more satisfied with the latter.The food can be inconsistent. There are days when I find the Pad Thai too dry or even too saucy. I understand that the cooks make a lot of Pad Thai (especially on Mondays), but I find the Pad Thai inconsistent even on weekends.I recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a quick lunch or looking for a place to sit down and hang out with their friends. The environment is very open and friendly.", 
      "Restaurant review:Eh, maybe I should have went with the curry. I was craving asian food and decided to come here for dinner. This restaurant reminds me of the Hong Kong dai pai dong food stalls where you order and they call your number to pick up your food. My wife had the pad thai which was a good value and tasted like pad thai. I ahd the pho and it was 2 thumbs down. Even though it was the combo pho with everything, there was not a lot of protein items and the noodles were overcooked. The worst thing was the pho broth which is usually a highlight. I don't know what they used to season it but somehow it tasted like dish water. There was no clear broth flavor with star of anise or hint of cinnamon. It just tasted very off and I could not stomach more than a spoon of the soup. If you want cheap food then the lunch special looks like a good deal, but stay away from the pho at all cost!Pro: inexpensive, no tip you bus your own tray, lots of seatingCons: terrible pho soup, not good at allHidden gem:I have not been here for lunch, but for 5 dollars that seems like a steal with good portion sizes per other reviews.", 
      "Needless to say, this place is amazing! Really love their daily special menu going on! Love going in and grabbing my favorite dish: yellow curry.", 
      "I don't know what the hype is about their noodle dishes, I was not impressed at all. However I will say their curry (red or green) is absolutely delicious. Also, it has plenty of meat and flavor.Their tom yun soup is amazing.", 
      "My score is 3/5 for the quality of the food, and an extra star for the price and how fast the food arrives. I work just off campus and come here at least twice a week for the daily $5 lunch specials. This place is very popular among students, so I try to come before 12 or after 1 if possible to avoid the crowds.", 
      "Bangkok Thai 911 is my favorite restaurant here in champaign. Reasonable price, awesome foods, nice services, I will give it 5 stars !", 
      "Oh man, having tried all the specials now, I can see why this place is so popular. For just $5.55 after tax for the lunch special, it is an incredible deal for what you get - very filling and delicious.Monday: Pad Thai - pretty standard, but good.Tuesday: Fried Rice. See my previous review.Wednesday: Basil Chicken - the sauce makes it. Mix it with the rice!Thursday: Yellow Curry. Very oily, probably because I had it very spicy and they added lots of chili oil. Comes with a huge chunk of rice - very filling. The curry itself was okay, frankly, I'm not much of a curry person.Friday: Pad Ke Mao. I got this with beef, and it was great. The noodles were well done, a decent amount of meat and veg, and the sauce is AMAZING. Couldn't get enough.I'd rank these, from most favorite to least favorite: Pad Ke Mao, Basil Chicken, Fried Rice, Pad Thai, Yellow Curry.If you regularly eat spicy food and have a reasonable tolerance, go for spice level 6 - it's just the right amount of kick.I mentioned in my previous review that the to-go containers are lined with foil. Apparently not always, because mine didn't have it today. Even worse, the woman that put my box in the bag did not think that I would actually carry the bag by the handles, because the box would be 90 degrees to the ground when carrying (with the opening facing directly down) - I didn't notice until it was too late, and now my bag is full of the sauce, which is the best part of the dish. :( It was a pain to clean it up and I'm unhappy I didn't get to eat any sauce, and it is why I'm docking one star.With that issue aside, I'm so happy with this place, but at the same time, unhappy, because it took until my senior year to try this place out! I could've been eating this for the last three years, damn!", 
      "I love to come here during dinner. I always end up ordering their special, which is also super cheap. Normally I would expect for this price to get very subpar food portions and quality. However, I was in fact quite wrong. The food tastes amazing and they give you a large portion which often takes me two meals to finish. I highly recommend this place.", 
      "This place is so so. Ordered the Panang curry with shrimp and all that was prepared was tiny shrimps in a bowl of curry with no veggies of any sort and served with a bowl of rice. Come on man??!!! WTH?!? Not even worth it!!! Also ordered the Pad See Ew and that was too salty and not enough noodles or meat. Tried to order a home made or made from scratch Thai iced tea and was referred to a can version of it! No thanks! And why would a Thai restaurant have pho on their menu??!!! Stick to your own cuisine and perfect that! Needless to say, pho isn't all that either. Everything there is over priced for mediocre food. Students beware! They think you don't care or know any better since you're college students! On the bright side, the fried rice was decent.", 
      "Some of the best Pho I have ever had, and I tried in LA, Denver , Chicago , etc. They had duck soup in pho and my wife was very happy. We have found a great place to eat after Illinois football games", 
      "I was firstly astonished by the price here. I mean, a pho at 8.95 obviously is not a champaign stuff. But seems this is the only Thai restaurant here. The pho tastes okayyy", 
      "Probably the greatest addition to campus in a long time. The other closest Thai food nearby would be Basil Thai, which is on the opposite end of campus. Every day during the week, there will be lunch specials. For a mere $5, you can enjoy food that is enough to be considered as two meals! In addition, you can also adjust the level of spiciness to your liking, on a scale of 1-6 if memory serves me right. Their pho is also fantastic! Very authentic and very large portion. One no longer had to travel to downtown Urbana to Xin Xin Cafe for pho. The staff are all extremely friendly and am not afraid to chat with you despite their slight language barrier. They are always cheerful and if there's something wrong with the order, they immediately replace it without further questions asked. Definitely a place worthy of regular visits!", 
      "The absolute best Thai food I've ever had. The panang curry and pad Thai are on point. The prices are very fair for the portions you receive especially if you catch the lunch specials. Always a great experience here.", 
      "Good food and you can't beat the lunch specials! I've come here for the Thursday curry and the Monday pad thai and both were great at only $5! Watch out, this place can get crowded at lunch but don't worry, the line moves quick.Can't wait to try the pho!10/27/14 UPDATEI just got back from eating here for lunch. They've instilled a new policy where if you order the special, its automatically served in takeout containers. For someone who goes out of their way to limit their contribution to landfills, I'm not sure if I'll be coming here often to say the least and I definitely will avoid ordering the daily special.", 
      "Some of my favorite Thai on campus!Really relaxed thai beachy feel on campus, and really great service.The food has ways been great - the panang curry and pad thai are two of my favorites, huge portions too.", 
      "Cheap (price wise) Thai food that is good. I've been to plenty of other Thai places that charge a lot more and the food is still not as good. I've stopped by quite a few times for the daily specials, which is completely worth it - good amount of food for $5-$6. Haven't tried the pho so I can't comment on that.", 
      "Slimy food. Slimy pad thai. Slimy fried rice.", 
      "Went here for lunch on a weekday. Its a campus location, so expect students, cheap prices and a \"hit or a miss\" food. We went primarily because my SO was craving for som Pho. Reading Yelp reviews, we walked over to this place. This is in the old Zyygyz location. Cant miss the green awnings.Its a hole in the wall. So dont come expecting a proper sit down place. We proceed to order a Pho and basil chicken. They have daily specials for $5. They have an assortment of condiments and a choice of spice level. Pho was a generous serving. We could not finish ours and it tasted really good.Basil chicken was acceptable. Overall, food was good. There were only a few tables occupied, so the food came out fast. Strongly recommend this place for lunch or a quick bite anytime. No complaints about food.Will return when we crave Thai or Pho.", 
      "My experience here was just okay. I ordered Pho and the broth just didn't cut it for me as being good but it was just alright. My boyfriend ordered the cashew chicken for the first time and he loved it. My friend got chicken fried rice and that was good as well. The price is fairly cheap for the portions at this place which is great for college students. I would come back here for food but not for the pho. I'm only giving three stars because of two reasons. One of them is that I ordered the Thai iced tea for almost $3 and I expecting to have some refreshing authentic Thai iced tea, but instead it was a really small bottled one from the fridge which was pretty disappointing and not worth $3. The woman behind the cashier said \"I'm too lazy to make a real one,\" as her excuse. My second reason is that the restaurant was way too humid and hot with the doors open on a humid rainy day. I was sweating uncomfortably while eating my hot pho and it was unpleasant. There were workers fixing the ceiling tiles or something nearby too, which I thought was unacceptable for when people are eating around them only a few feet away. The food was good, the atmosphere not so much. I will still be coming back for a quick Thai fix because it's so accessible and conveniently located on Green st.", 
      "I am always on the hunt for some good Thai, especially the Pad Thai! In all my travels I don't know if I've stumbled upon such good Pad Thai at such an affordable price. The portions were larger, and the service quick. It wasn't much of a place to go for ambiance, but if you're wanting good Thai, this place is a must!", 
      "Yummy You really tell there was some bang in that kok if you know what I mean. Hahahahaha", 
      "My boyfriend and I came here looking for good thai iced teas and good thai food. We got the xe lua pho and it was delicious. It wasn't as authentic as some viet places back in California but it definitely filled the missing void for pho that I had. My boyfriend ordered the pad kee mao. Omg it was phenomenal. Giant chunks of noodle with some veggies. We both thought it was great. The only downsides were the spring rolls had too much lettuce and they didn't have authentic thai iced teas (only ones that came in pre packaged bottles - which still tasted fine but not what we were looking for) All in all, great food. Good find but those disappointments weren't worth taking a star off for. Highly recommend!", 
      "Dirty, overpriced and untasty. My pho tasted like one big bowl of OLD salt water. \u00a0Very little meat, no thai basil. \u00a0Honestly, the worse bowl of Pho I've ever tried (couldn't bring myself to do it) to eat. My dinner partners fried rice was oily with no veggies and little meat. Our soft drinks which were listed as \"free refills\" for $1.75 were given to us in 12oz cans, with no refills available. Our appetizer sampler only contained 1/2 of what it was listed to have. We had chosen to eat there, but all the tables were filthy. Even though there were only two other tables eating at the time we were there no employees choose to take advantage of the lull for some cleaning.. No thank you yelp community. You missed the mark on this one.", 
      "Some of the best pho you can get on campus. Go during lunch time for cheaper prices. Don't forget to look at the special of day for added discounts. Flavor-wise, the broth is pretty authentic. I find their tripe a bit hard and chewy sometimes, but the beef balls and other meat is done really well. So...sounds pretty good, right? Well, everything's great until you see the price tag. In Vietnam, you can buy an amazing, overflowing bowl of pho for, get this, $1. Yep. Here, it verges from $6-9. Given that it's the only place on campus though, I would collect those dollars together, my friends. This place is totally worth that added hole in your wallet, at least once a month.", 
      "Come here for a quickly prepared, delicious meal. I've been here a few times, and I am a fan of their pad see ew, curries, and pho. However, I think that while the pho broth has good flavor, it is also heavily garlicky, so I would recommend adding more sriracha or lime juice to counterbalance the flavor if you're not a big fan of garlic. In general, it's not the best Southeast Asian food I've had (I grew up in New York City), but it holds its own. The cons are that the ambiance is lacking and the thai iced tea comes in a bottle instead of being made from scratch.Daily specials ($4.99 lunch and $5.99 dinner) as of today are:Monday - Pad ThaiTuesday - Fried RiceWednesday - Basil ChickenThursday - Yellow CurryFriday - Pad Ke Mao", 
      "Like other reviewers have mentioned, Bangkok Thai has a 5 dollar lunch special for every weekday with massive two meal servings. However, thats the end of the positive things I have to say about this place. I have noticed that their spice levels are very inconsistent. I have ordered a spicy 6 (the highest level) and received a dish with no spice at all. Additionally, the food is almost always extremely oily.", 
      "Pho Tai :DThe broth: Great, not too sweet or heavily spiced.Meat: They drop it in right at the last minute when packing up your soup to go, so it's fresh. There is a decent portion of it. Definitely way more noodles than meat, but it's ehough to make me happy.The vegetables: sprouts, green onion, lime, and a big portion of noodles. No thai basil included, you can ask them to add some on the side.I recommend taking it to go, coming home, and pouring everything into one of your own big bowls at home for a more cozy feeling than eating in the restaurant which is a little divey (although cute with the turtle tank in the back and the beachy looking awning). I also snuck a little of my brother's pad thai (I'm dieting, ho hum) and it was delicious.", 
      "I have been here several times now and every time it is astronomically delicious! \u00a0Though, to be 100% honest the only thing I ever get there is Chicken Pad Thai and Crab Rangoon.The store itself is hidden in what seems like an apartment complex right across from a laundry mat.The owner of this location is a nice guy with a open and joking personality. \u00a0when I first went their and ordered Pad Thai he got this evil/mischievous smirk on his face and asked if I like spicy food. \u00a0Though I had already been forwarded about their spicy level and stated my preferred starter number which was 3 to vary how spicy I could go and one day when I feel nice a stupid I'll go up to 6 but I am not a young man anymore and I WILL regret that act of bravado. If you love Pad Thai go there on Monday as it is on special for $5.99", 
      "I love this place. Honestly probably go here the most on campus. \u00a0I can't say anything about it being authentic because it's the only thai place I've been to but I think it's amazing. I love their specials during lunch and dinner. Such a good deal and I like basically all of them. The owners are so nice too. I think my favorite is the yellow curry which is on special on Thursdays. I think the fact that it's always busy shows how much other people like it too. I usually get take out just because but the when I eat there the tables are always clean and I think the rice portion is bigger. \u00a0This is a put your dish in the bin place but for the cheap price I don't mind. Also love the little turtles in the back! I'm gonna miss this place when I graduate.", 
      "My newest addiction! I had never tried Pho before and my sister recommended it to cure a killer hangover. It worked and it was delicious. I can't resist coming back since I live so close.The only thing I have eaten here is the Seafood Pho and it is phenomenal. It is filling, well made and absolutely delicious. It is about 10 dollars but you get so much. It lasted me 2 meals when I was moderately hungry one time.The staff is very friendly, it seems clean and everyone always looks happy with their food. I love this place, definitely try it if you haven't.",

      "I frequent this place for lunch and the amount of food is always something that makes me smile. For the $5.50 lunch special you get a heaping of food, and it's always delicious. It's definitely my go-to spot for lunch!", 
      "Bankok Thai is such a hidden treasure! It's hidden in that little nook on the corner of Fifth and Green Street. It's in the location across from where Bombay Grill used to be. The staff is very friendly and are very welcoming! Whenever I go in or even call in, I'm always greeted by a happy face or a happy \"Hello!\"The pho here is awesome! I always order the beef pho and it never disappoints. It's around $9-$10 for any pho and they give you a heaping plate full of additions! The broth, noodles and bean sprouts are more than enough to make you feel full and satisfied when you're done. Bon app\u00e9tit, friends!",

      "I went here with a meetup group last night. We ordered chips and guacamole and chips and salsa as appetizers. Good stuff! Then, we all ordered drinks. I tried the Spicy Mango margarita. It was delicious and I loved that you get that spicy kick on the get go. Others had the sangria and El diablo. Everyone said the drinks were tasty. :) I had the pollo torta for my entree and it was really good. The chicken wasn't dry and the flavors were nice. Everyone else's food looked delicious too and I didn't hear anyone complain. It was a good night out with good food and tasty drinks.", 
      "Last night we had early evening dinner reservations for a party of six. By the time my wife and I got there (a little late due to rain), the others were already seated and had ordered some appetizers -- chips & salsa and traditional guacamole -- which were quite good. We had a smattering of margaritas, tequila flights, beer and the Ladies Best Friend, which my wife really enjoyed. The drinks were outstanding.We were initially seated inside, but chose to switch to outside once the rain had completely passed and the tables and chairs were wiped dry. Five people had some sort of taco meal and I had steak Mesquite Fajitas. Everyone seemed to enjoy the tacos. The fajitas were not sizzling as one would normally expect. They were just okay.Service at Wedge was exceptional! Although the interior was already crowded, our waitress was attentive inside and remained so once we moved outside.I had not been particularly tempted to go to Wedge since tequila has traditionally upset my stomach. However, I did try some habanero tequila, which was very good -- with no bad effects!We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday girl got a free tequila shot after dinner. Not bad.All in all, we had a delightful evening and will surely return -- perhaps to try one of the many different dinner specials that Wedge has throughout the week.", 
      "There's a cute little tequila bar on Neil st and inside this bar you can find a handful of trendy students having a good time over great drinks. The bar tenders are cute and friendly with their own edgy styles. The wait staff, young and professional with good knowledge of menu items. I decided to give this place a try after reading reviews on it. It was a grey cloudy day and it had just finished raining, as cute as it looked, outside seating was out of the question. But just to let you know, it is available. It is a seat yourself place, So I plopped at the bar, quickly greeted and met with a drink menu. By the by, all cocktails are only $6 on hump day.. \u00a0I love me some margaritas. The spicy pineapple margarita was my choice tonight and I had that to enjoy while looking over the menu. Finally decided to have the steak torta, carnitas taco, chips and ranchero guacamole. There was no stagnant wait time to place my order as the bartender was very attentive despite the semi crowded bar. It was about give minutes later, boom, my chips come out. The chips are a crunchy kind of good. There are three kinds of guacamole in which I ordered the chunky spicy kind. It was a perfect accompaniment with my drink and anticipation for my meal. Before I can get halfway down my drink and just as I got over the chips, tada... Here comes my food. The timing couldn't be any more spot on. The steak torta was very tasty. It was seasoned and moist with the toasted bread just crisp. The sandwich was pretty darn good. On the plate were also potato wedges that came with aioli dip. Without the dip, the wedges were.. meh. It's all about that dip. Done with my first drink, I gave the bar tender a nod and boom another one came. Completed my steak, on to my taco. The carnitas or pork, was a bit dry and it was just ok. Following the steak, it wasn't great. Finished it anyway, dipped it in the guac and poured salsa on it. That did the trick. Munched on the chips some more as I wrote this review. The environment is clean, friendly and inviting. The wait staff is awesome. The food is great. And the prices are reasonable. The music is trendy and relatively current. I would come back here again for sure. The restroom , sit or squat. \u00a0 I give it a sit!", 
      "Do NOT GO HERE. I have 3 friends that have had food poisoning on 3 separate occasions.. (And when they consulted the restaurant, they denied that it was their fault) If you must go, do it on a Saturday so you can be sick all day Sunday.....", 
      "Their tacos really are pretty great. Their choices of margaritas are very plentiful and I don't think anyone could be bored with their drink menu. Their fajitas, though, seemed old (not even sizzling when brought out, although still hot-ish). The meat was about 3/4 fat, instead of meat, so eating the fajita tacos was more of a task than enjoying a meal since I had to pull out the fat. I think if I go back, I'll definitely stick to the tacos. Tried the pineapple and mango jalapeno margaritas...the mango is definitely more spicy than the pineapple. Both were decent, though.---the Monday margarita flight is amazing!! Also, the Monday taco special is great. I'd definitely recommend getting tacos when you come here, but steer clear of the steak! The blood orange margarita is now a favorite.", 
      "Food is great! Tastes delicious and even better when they have their $2 tacos on Tuesdays and Sundays. I would go for the Lomo (steak) tacos. Also, the Potato wedges are sooo flame!Service is mediocre but very friendly. Sometimes I feel like the waiters get confused at what they're doing - doing too much or doing too little. Drinks are pretty good. Except they forgot to put salt on the last margarita I ordered... huh?Atmosphere is great. Bathrooms are clean and tidy. Outdoor seating is very nice too.", 
      "Not your everyday Mexican restaurant; Wedge offers a very stylish bar scene with a unique twist on your typical Mexican food. The fish tacos were AMAZING! My boyfriend tried the shrimp, and we both agreed that the tilapia tacos were better. (I even indulged in a pomegranate margarita afterwards!) Overall great first impression!!", 
      "So, after our poor experience with Wedge early on, my wife and I decided to give them another try for brunch. \u00a0BIG MISTAKE. \u00a0First off, and most importantly, I got food poisoning -- possible culprits were their guacamole that had a faintly moldy taste to it, the chips that were stale, and the mushy rice that seemed like it had been sitting in a steam table all day.Even if you don't buy the food poisoning issue, the food was just awful. \u00a0Crushed, canned pineapple on the (moldy) guacamole; mushy, gross rice with obviously pre-frozen vegetable medley folded into it; lukewarm coffee. \u00a0I didn't even get asked how I wanted my eggs on my huevos rancheros, and they came out over-hard (blech). \u00a0The tortillas (like the chips) were stale. \u00a0The service was terrible as well, complementing their awful food. \u00a0Our waitress only brought one of us a water (odd choice), asked for our drink order and walked away after only ONE of us answered, tripped and sloshed my lukewarm coffee all over the mug and saucer, and rather than cleaning it up, simply set it down, asked if I wanted a napkin, and never returned with one -- leaving me with a mug covered in coffee. \u00a0We had to ask for silverware after our food was delivered. \u00a0Meanwhile, the other server was shouting across the patio to (who I guess was) the manager on duty for information as to what various items on the menu were. \u00a0Given there is better Mexican AND brunch options within walking distance of this place, I can't imagine why ANYONE would go here.", 
      "Disappointing. I wonder if this place imagines itself more as a tequila bar than a restaurant. We went there for a meal. I like fish tacos (some people think it's an odd combination), but this was so overcooked I could barely bite through it. The black bean side was good. The pickled vegetables I think I liked the idea more than the executable. Rice was bland. My dinner companion said his salad was just OK and didn't even bother to finish his margarita. The potato wedge appetizer was good and the aioli was nicely spicy.All in all, it was just ok. I'd probably go back, but I'm not in any rush.", 
      "I have liked how the outside looked ever since I came to UIUC, and I was enticed by their advertisement. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the food. (No comment on the drinks, I didn't have one.) Everything was cold or looked like it had been under a warmer even though we were some of the only customers. The chips were hard and greasy, as if fried more than twice. The guacamole was mediocre at best. The water even tastes awful, no amount of lime could cover it up. The rice looked and tasted old and the way the food was displayed was unappetizing. The service was fine, but she really shouldn't recommend something that tastes gross. Maybe this would be good \"drunk food\" but I won't be returning to find out.", 
      "What this place has going for it is the Tequila. It is a great spot for professionals to come and get a drink with their friends. Food is tasty but menu options are limited. Seating is also limited because of the size of the restaurant (which is very small) and when it fills up the place gets pretty loud. Lots of solid daily specials for their tacos and drinks.", 
      "I thought this was a restaurant but it's more like a little bar tucked away in Downtown. \u00a0It's not amazing.. but I also live in California now so I have ample access to great Mexican food which is cheaper than this.Still.. it was pleasant. \u00a0The waitstaff was nice. \u00a0There were a ton of girls here for some reason the night I was there.I did not try their margaritas even though it was a $5 special. \u00a0I find that sometimes the well drinks at tequila places aren't that good anyways.So I tried their tortilla soup. \u00a0A bit dissapointing for a Mexican restaurant. \u00a0My favorite one was at Grove Tavern. \u00a0Then I tried their carne asada. \u00a0Large in portion.. ehhh.. it was just okay. \u00a0It seemed a little dry to be honest. \u00a0It's kind of weird that I remember El Toro being so much better. \u00a0But maybe it's because I was a college student back then. \u00a0Anyways, not too much seating area so I can't imagine getting a seat on a busy weekend night. \u00a0As for upscale.. ehhhh.. I don't know.. beside it being in downtown, I'm not sure about that.", 
      "One of my absolute favorite places to grab food. Eclectic food menu, drinks menu, and vibe. \u00a0The tacos and chips & salsa are very authentic and very yummy! \u00a0Also, the staff has been great every time I have been.", 
      "Wedge is a welcome sight for my belly... yes my belly can see tacos. I like the idea of well done Mexican Cuisine in downtown Champaign. I\"m a big fan of the way they do their tacos. I have had a pretty tasty Margarita here as well, that said, I like Pacifico with my tacos.The staff is on point. What?!?!", 
      "I went here for dinner with a friend this past Thursday evening and we had a great experience from drinks to food to the customer service.We were able to be seated outside on the patio immediately upon arrival which was great! \u00a0Our server was very friendly and attentive; she provided recommendations for drinks and food and she didn't rush us out after finishing our meal which I really appreciated, especially with it being such a pleasant summer night to sit outside. \u00a0We both went with the taco dinner-I chose 1 fish taco and 1 of their calabacitas (zucchini blossoms, yum!) tacos, while my friend went with 2 chicken tacos. \u00a0We also both got one of their lime margaritas. \u00a0The dinner came with refried beans, rice, and some pickled veggies too! \u00a0All in all, we were both pleased with our food! \u00a0The calabacitas taco was my favorite hands-down, but the fish taco was pretty yummy too. \u00a0I would definitely recommend Wedge as a great spot to sit outside, catch up with friends, and enjoy some Mexican food in downtown Champaign for a fairly reasonable price.", 
      "Objectively bad. When I found out this place was owned by the people that owned El Toro it all made sense. I do not know how this place or El Toro manage to stay in business considering that they are literally some of the worst \"mexican\" places I have ever eaten at. A friend of mine ordered the guacamole and reported feeling not well after eating it (she hadn't been drinking so you can't blame the booze).", 
      "A hidden gem in Downtown Champaign. I would recommend coming on a Wednesday for their $6 taco dinner and $6 margarita drink special. The hibiscus margarita was delicious and reminded me of summer! Definitely will be back here before school lets out to grab a drink on their patio.", 
      "I went here with a friend Sunday night and they had $4.00 margaritas! That's a plus! We had already eaten dinner somewhere else but the margarita was tasty. And they checked on us but not to a point of bothersome. I'd go back. ;)", 
      "Where to begin. This place is a bona fide cluster...you know. I have been wanting to try it after hearing about all the different drinks and tequilas they had, but all that waiting was in vain. First off, I made a reservation, but was placed under a tent in \u00a0a parking lot on a 45 degree evening. It was warm when we first walked in, but were placed in the back where there were no heater lamps and the temperature was unbearable. We asked to be moved to a table closer to the one functioning heater lamp and were accommodated by the staff (although, in hindsight I wish we wouldn't have been so we would have gotten out then). After being comfortable for about ten minutes the lamp was moved to the back so we were freezing again, but by that point we were ready to leave. We ordered apps to start and got salsa and the ranchero guac. The salsa was good, but the guac was TERRIBLE. it was as cold as the wind blowing under the tent and despite the menu listing it as guacamole with pico de gallo and queso, there was no cheese visible or to taste and as many chunks of tomato and onion as corn (which coincidentally is not supposed to be in this version of guacamole). This led us to believe that they just made one large batch that they could serve as any of the three sub par renditions and stored it in a freezer all day. My drink (the diablo) was satisfactory. My boyfriend ordered the traditional margarita that included patron, patron citronage, orange liqueur and agave nectar. It tasted awful and they upcharged 50 cents for his request of Don Julio Blanco, which is acceptable, but then he was randomly charge $3 for Grand Marnier out of the blue. At that point it wasn't even worth dealing with so we paid and left. Their menu looks pretty good until you start tasting the food, but an individual taco is $3 and a platter of 5 tacos is $15...not a mathematician but that's not really a deal...actually it's not a deal at all. BOTTOM LINE: just don't do it. The food is wanna be upscale but is a flat out miss. The drinks are interesting, but seem to be a crapshoot depending on the specific cocktail.", 
      "An excellent Mexican and Tequila bar in this sleepy college town. \u00a0Everything here is very fresh and made with quality. \u00a0It is a really small area. \u00a0A U shaped bar, with a few high top tables, and a bit more private booths. \u00a0No TV's at the bar, which is saying something in this town. \u00a0I really like the vibe here. \u00a0Relaxed and cozy during off hours. \u00a0Though this small spot gets packed during the weekend. \u00a0Though the bartenders and waitresses do their best, and the food always seems to come out quick.My family and I found a seat in one of the booths. \u00a0A smaller menu, with a few aps, tacos, and a few entrees. \u00a0You can mix and match 5 tacos for $15. \u00a0I love the Pastor, and Chorizo tacos. \u00a0The Pastor has a great mix of fruity sweetness and heat. \u00a0The Chorizo has a really good kick. \u00a0Fresh as can be guacamole, and the black beans are so flavorful. \u00a0Certainly not your typical mushy flavorless mass of beans at most mediocre Tex-Mex places.The bar is well stocked. \u00a0I am not a Tequila guy at all, but the Margaritas here are top notch. \u00a0They make some really good cocktails with the several house infused Tequilas and a huge selection to choose from.Tasty food that is more than the typical Tex-Mex joint, good bar, good service, and an all around fun place for a meal and a few drinks in this wonderful, but small downtown.", 
      "Monday night specials are great! The $10 taco sampler and $10 margarita sampler are a great way to get happy hour started. Our server was very attentive and the patio was kept clean. My chair was broken when I sat down, and it ripped my dress a little. I was with a group including my mother, and she thought the clothing on the waitresses was a little risky (shorts were pretty short/tight). I used to work in food and I can see her perspective, but for downtown champaign this kind of apparel is nothing new. I would suggest a visit! Good presentation is also exceptional for the CU area.", 
      "I live for their nachos!!! My husband and I always plan to go there when visiting my sister in Champaign. The drinks are always good and \"knock you on your ass\" strong. I'm not exactly a fan of their other menu options but those nachos are delish!!!!", 
      "First time we have eaten here last Week. It was $5 margarita and \u00a0$5 taco night. My wife had the sangria and tj out it was good. Two of us picked two different tacos and everything was very good. My wife had the chicken nachos . I liked the topping but the chips were thicker than I prefer. Overall a god meal for a good price .", 
      "Both of us had gotten pretty sick the next morning, but at least the food tasted good.Starting off with the \"Perfect Patron Margarita\" and Modelo, we were greeted with a warm \"Fondue Del Mar.\" \u00a0We also shared the Ribeye Torta and three different tacos.", 
      "My group of four unanimously agreed that this was a good place to have a meal. The menu is different from many Mexican restaurants. The main dishes are tacos and there are some entree options as well as a nice selection of appetizers. I had one chicken (pollo, for your Spanish speakers) taco and one vegetarian of some kind. They were both pretty good. I would be interested in trying other items on another visit. Parking was easy. The best part of the meal was the margerita.", 
      "The outdoor patio is so cute, but seriously it's waaaay too close to the street and parking lot. One does not forget that traffic is nearby due to the frequent noise and the persistent smell of exhaust.However, the drinks are divine (lots of margaritas from which to choose) and apps are varied and pleasing. If the server warns that a dish is spicy, he/she is not messing around. I absolutely love spicy food, and I was not disappointed. Although I miss the old Carmen's restaurant at this same location, Wedge seems like a pretty good addition to downtown Champaign.", 
      "Try the Juan Collins. It's a crisp tequila version of a Tom Collins.", 
      "Just when I was craving some Mexican food, Wedge delivered!The place is stellar for a few different reasons: great guac, nice vibe, and heightened food. If you're a guacamole fan, you will love this place! Place an order for the guac and you will be delighted with the freshness of the guacamole and the freshly fried chips. The chips are crispy, light, and seem homemade (I'm betting they are and if they are not, we need to figure out the brand and get our grubs on them ASAP). I'm not sure about others, but I could just have guacamole for dinner....The menu, on the whole, is on the smaller end, but what you do get is elevated food. What I mean by elevated is: slightly couture food (yea, let's call it that). My tacos came with really delicious pickled veggies, and nicely cooked rice. One criticism of the menu: there are only two vegetarian dishes, but that being said, the two that they have (both tacos) are pretty fabulous. The service here is great, I might add. However, the best part is the ambiance and the vibe. Wedge has a wonderful outdoor area for sitting and dining, bar dining inside, and also typical sit down type dining. Whatever experience you're looking for, they have it here. If you're stopping through, or if your a newbie (like myself), I would highly recommend Wedge!", 
      "Wow. \u00a0I was disappointed by Wedge. \u00a0I had high hopes for this, and my spouse and I went here for a nice date night. \u00a0The restaurant was packed, and the tables were way, way too close together - our chairs kept bumping into the tables behind us, and the waitress was tripping over chairs trying to get to us. \u00a0It was uncomfortable and awkward.The service was not good at all. \u00a0I think it was because they were understaffed and very overcrowded, but I still like it if the waitress checks in more than every half hour, and if we don't have to ask more than once for things like napkins. \u00a0The real problem, though, was the food. \u00a0My margarita was nice, and the appetizer was mediocre. \u00a0I ordered two vegetarian tacos. \u00a0One of them was just alright, but when I bit into the other, I found ACTUAL FISH BONES. \u00a0I am not kidding. \u00a0Not just one. \u00a0Maybe 5. \u00a0I had a mouthful of them. \u00a0It was completely revolting. \u00a0When I told the waitress, she did take it off our bill, but tried to argue with me about whether it was actually fish bones, and tried to tell me it was \"hardened flour.\" \u00a0I definitely know it was not. \u00a0Finally, our dessert was pretty underwhelming - the \"death by chocolate\" was basically a piece of boxed chocolate cake right out of the fridge, thrown on the very edge of a large plate with nothing else on it.If it weren't for the LITERAL FISH BONES in my vegetarian taco, I probably would have ranked this a two, but sorry - that's just foul.", 
      "Wedge is a restaurant that serves Mexican food, but served and plated creatively. \u00a0As an appetizer, we ordered a tamale. To our surprise, the tamale came with pickled cactus (which we thought was green beans). \u00a0I was happy to see the pickled cactus because this side dish is more in line with authentic mexican foodI ordered a steak torta and it was packed with flavor and the steak was nice and tender. \u00a0The dishes are reasonably priced. I thought the food and service here were really great. Plenty of street parking and free in the evenings.", 
      "We had such high hopes! It's a cute restaurant with a lot of ambiance. All the signs of 'winner.' Unfortunately it ended being a disappointing experience! We ordered a number of dishes and everything was bland or awful. The chips were stale, the ceviche flavorless, the salsa watery, and the wedge salad was the worse we ever had. (How do you mess up a wedge salad? ). On top of the bad food....service was slow. And, we sat on the patio next to a chain smoker. On our way home we stopped by another restaurant to 'erase' the bad memories from our palates. We normally enjoy dining out downtown was bar far the worst experience we've ever had.", 
      "I am from Indiana and located this restauant on Yelp. My husband and I were in town for a friend's event and I was excited to find a tequila bar. Online the menu shows several infused and flavored tequilas which I was looking forward to trying. On arrival we learned they have changed their menus and none of these are available. So instead we got margaritas which were good but overpriced for the size $9 each for the size of a small martini. Tacos were Awesome! Chips were greasy and bland. Go for the tacos but not if your looking for infused tequila... their web site is inaccurate and needs updating.", 
      "\"The Abstract\": There are better places in town - Maize #1, by far, Huaraches Moroleon #2. Chipotle #3. Not exactly trendy, but the food is better at those places. Was this worth a \"date night\" with my husband ? Not really. When you have to pay for a baby-sitter a date night better be worth it! Wedge was more miss than hit for us, and while it wasn't terrible, it just isn't worth a repeat for us, especially since we can't really come here with our son - too bar-like b/c most of the tables have high bar stools. There are better (casual and pricy) places for a date in C-U. Pros:The server was great! Mixed up a fancy N/A juice for me since I'm pregnant. The fish tacos- very good- loved the sauce especially. But go easy on the cabbage!The steak tacos w/ poblano - good.Beer prices were reasonable.Meh: Tacos al Pastor - decent, but not worth a repeat visit, IMO. Guacamole - decent flavor- a bit too acidic, not enough salt.Cons: Chips and salsa are NOT free - it's $3 for an order!Beans - fresh out of a.... Can. So easy to make good beans, no excuses here.Guacamole price was high compared to other places around town (and yes, I know the cost of an avocado $0.90-1.79/each- esp owning the El Toros in town, I'm sure the owners get them cheaper than we can at Meijer. Price was $6 for a small portion that was *maybe*a single avocado. Seated right by the door - kept getting interrupted so servers could get liquor out, new patrons walking in - it was freezing! Forget a \u00a0nice date - we were cold and felt *very* rushed. If you want to get drinks and linger, or dessert, sit in the back. If you want a Jimmy Johns \"Freaky Fast\" experience, sit in the front. Carnitas taco - absolutely disgusting. It tasted like the meat was rotten. The nuts were whole and just didn't work \u00a0- would be better chopped up, but they dont' really add to the taco. This actually made me feel sick. My husband agreed.", 
      "I knew this place would be good.My mojito was one of the best I've had. I loved the tacos al pastor. In fact I love anything al pastor.When I heard it was a tequila bar, I assumed there would be tons of latin women in short skirts and loud mariachi musica. No miniskirts tonight. Music was quiet and more classical than I expected. The place is dimly lit, but it looks great.Not sure whether to consider it a bar with food or a restaurant with excellent drinks.", 
      "UPS: Great food, generous portions, well-priced, creative menu, great location, a few free parking spots, hipster hotspot.DOWNS: Slightly odd that no Mexican people serve the customers, service is inconsistent (ie food can arrive quickly, but both times it took FOREVER to get the check).If they can iron out the service issues it will be a GEM :)", 
      "I got food poisoning from the steak here. So did my friend (who ordered a steak sandwich), and while we were dining, I overheard a phone call that was very likely a possible foodborne illness complaint. (The waitress responded with comments like \"I'm so sorry.. no we have not had any other similar complaints.. I am so sorry I will have the GM call you back.\" I did not think anything of it at the time because I understand it could be anything.)I called, with no mean intentions, to inform them that I, as well as the doctor I went to see at Carle Clinic, were 95% positive that Wedge was the source of this foodborne illness, and the doctor assured me it was NOT the flu. \u00a0Wedge did not return my 3 calls until 3 days later, and the GM's response was that \"I'm pretty confident we are not the source. There is a bad flu going around.\" Thanks for the call. By the way, unless your steak always tastes that dry, then there probably was something wrong with it. Will not return again.GROSS!", 
      "The food tries its best to be upscale, though I'm not really buying it. The Tacos Pastor and the sandwiches are pretty good, but not super-fancy and a bit small for the price. The place is also a bit tiny, and if you've got a group larger than four, good luck getting seats.Why four stars, then? Because this place has a ton of tequila, and a lot of really good choices. I was a huge fan of the tequila flights (I sprung for a Reposado flight my first time there) and they've got a bar full of bottles you can't get anywhere else. I've found it annoying that I can't get a plain old margarita in the past, and then I remember that I can get a glass of Riazul for $6 and I shut right up. If you're looking to do tequila shots with the limes and the salt and the children in Campustown, this isn't going to do much for you. But if you're looking for a nice place to sit back and enjoy tasting a spirit that people normally don't sip, it's awesome.", 
      "Stopped by on a chilly evening to meet some friends for a birthday party. I would not recommend this restaurant for a group outing as there are very few tables that seat over 4 people. I would recommend (the) Wedge for a date, however! It is cozy and the atmosphere is lively. Servers were attentive and didn't mind our party being laid back about ordering. I tried a delicious a\u00f1ejo, the guacamole, and a pastor taco. The drinks are reasonably priced for the location and atmosphere, and the bartenders/waitstaff are educated about the drink menu. The guacamole comes in a very small portion but it was quite good (I found the chips to be greasy though). The tacos were tasty.. perhaps not as authentic as el charro or maize but decently priced at $3 for what you get (quite a filling portion and the taco was piled with lots of extras, including roasted pineapple and chile de arbol salsa--yum!). I'm not sure that I will be back immediately but it's a worthwhile spot to check out if you want something a little different for the area.", 
      "For the area, the food is good-- not the best Mexican/Latin food that I have had, but definitely better than the standard El Toro/ Mas Amigos food. It is more Latin-American fusion than anything. Great tequila list. In terms of mixed drinks, wish they had more margarita options like prickly pear, grapefruit, or tamarindo. But I will say that their standard lime margarita, which I judge all tequila bars/ Mexican restaurants against, was pretty good. Just too bad they use orange juice in the mix. All in all I would go back again.", 
      "Drinks are great - wide selection of tequilas and tequila flights. \u00a0Food is so-so, we've had dinner several times at the wedge (trying different items) and have never been impressed."

      "This place is awesome. If you want a huge over the top sandwich then definitely give this place a shot. The guy working was very cool and helpful. Since it was our first time eating here he told us some of the more popular sandwiches and the current specials they had that could save us a few bucks. Also they had old school pinball machines which I really love. Check this place out! You get a ton of food for a reasonable price.", 
      "FOOD: 1 star - I would have rated the food 3 stars if hadn't been for the disgusting pubic looking hair I found on my food. I got the fat frat and it didn't have any cheese steak meat as advertised. I'm all for full flavored (aka fat & salt) food but the hair and meat aside, it just wasn't all that good. \u00a0SERVICE: 3 stars - Friendly service. It's an order at the counter and pick your food up at the counter kinda place. ENVIRONMENT: 2 stars - The decor and ambience could use some work.", 
      "If you want some obese and delicious sandwiches, then this is the place to go. First of all, I feel like their creative ideas for sandwiches stems from Epic Meal Time (youtube.com/watch?v=m9FR\u2026). They add fries to all their fat sandwiches. There isn't much space to eat inside. I know that they're trying to go with the whole \"divey\" feel, but divey doesn't necessarily have to mean dirty. The least they could do is wipe down the tables after they're used. They blast really loud rock music which makes it quite difficult to have a conversation with your mates. it was interesting seeing a group of kids eating here considering that they have sandwiches called Fat Sororistute, Fat Motherclucker, and Fat Milf. I felt the best part of my fat sandwich was the mini corn dogs. Also, it's open at 3:00am which is great if you're having a hankering for munchies after some late night studying. Mmhm.", 
      "This place is gross. I got the Fat Milf and it was shameful to eat. Everything is frozen and fried. However, I'll probably come back if I'm hammered. Service was great though.I literally almost sh!t my pants when I was riding my bike home. I was sweatin. I feel like a gained 5lbs from this place from one visit.", 
      "This place is what it is. It's fat, carb-heavy food with no regard for your health, your wallet, or your vegetarian friends.That said, the sandwiches are pretty grease-free, they hold together pretty well, and they're a really unique experience if you're feeling adventurous. The staff here is pretty cool, too.Without a doubt one of the least healthy places to eat in town, but worth a trip every now and then.", 
      "Fat Sandwich Company. The name says it all really. The perfect place to order the most outrageous and over the top sandwiches that pack 2,000 calories into one 8\" bun. It is impossible to leave this place still hungry that's for sure. The place is small and divey, which serves it's purpose perfectly. The menu is as over the top as you would expect from a place named Fat Sandwich, serving up everything from deep fried cheesecake, to a 20,000 calorie monstrosity known as \"The Big Fat Ugly\", to a bacon cheeseburger on a glazed doughnut. They also deliver beer-- every college kids dream-- and they're conveniently located right on campus.The bottom line is, the place isn't meant to be fine dining, it's meant to give you the most densely packed, calorie infused, cardiac arrest inducing food this side of the Mississippi. It succeeds and then some. Would recommend it to everyone at least once. Truly a local legend.", 
      "I jus came here for the 1st time, tried the Fat Lush which contains grilled chkn pieces, cheesesteak, BBQ sauce, mozzarella sticks and fries piled on. Let me jus say.. It's a Gr8 F'n sammich, 'Nuff said!! I'll definitely b bak! They serve beer too for 2-2.50 a bottle & sandwiches are around $10, not bad. Four pinball machines available, rather expensive tho(1 play is 75c, 4 plays $2)", 
      "I didn't know what was ordered for me, or why it took 30 minutes to arrive, but what I received was absolutely ridiculous.Now I was pretty hungry, it had been a night out that reminded me of my youth, however on this day, I was a graying 30 year old, who needed some late night food.I was not prepared for what I received. \u00a0I was under the impression I was getting a steak and cheese sandwich, what I received however, was a delicious endless abomination. \u00a0It was a gyro chicken tender and french fry sandwich, with a mozzarella stick packed in its behind for good measure. \u00a0What is this monstrosity? \u00a0I took one bite head on without modification, and nearly collapsed from the enormity of it.Eventually I slowly deconstructed this mammoth, first removing most of the french fries, after realizing the contents of the sandwich I decided to cull a few chicken tenders off the top, those had left me full enough to where the rest of the sandwich - which looked like a delicacy a few moments ago - was making me sick from how full I was.I debated packing the remaing 80% of it up and eating it for the next few days, or perhaps shipping it off to Africa where it could surely keep a small village going for 2-3 weeks. \u00a0However it unfortunately ended up in an empty bag of Doritos and then in to the trash.Fat Sandwich - I don't know what you think you're doing, but please carry on.",

I loved the Fat Blue and the Fat Cowboy. \u00a0if you order a side of fries expect to get about 4 potatoes worth. You can also order beer and cigars/cigarettes with your food and they even have a 2 sandwich 6 pack of beer special called the drunken three-way which is a great deal.bring change for parking though as this establishment is located in the campus town area and you have to pay for everything there. \u00a0like they don't gouge the students enough with tuition.", 
      "Not very good and I've spent a lot of time in the fat market. Sandwiches are over complicated and not really sure how they come up with them. I'm sure the place stays open for the hungover crowd. The ingredients are nothing special so not sure if a simpler sandwich would be good. They do have fast delivery.", 
      "Ok, in theory Fat Sandwich is kind of funny. \u00a0Imagine this as a business proposal. \u00a0Let's blare (and I'm talking BLARE) classical music early on a Sunday morning to get the goat of all the hungover college kids coming in looking like zombies. \u00a0Make the kids wince under the horrible fluorescent lighting as they try to read the menu and massage their throbbing temples. \u00a0Make the menu misleading, never saying that all the things you think you're getting as side orders are actually stuffed onto a sandwich, that thanks to all the necessary bells and whistles, doesn't actually have much of the main substance you ordered said sandwich for. \u00a0Charge upwards and onwards of acceptable prices. \u00a0Never, ever clean the bathrooms and in fact, add in artificial pee scents. \u00a0Watch money roll in. \u00a0Now let's be serious here. \u00a0This is reality. \u00a0I'm not in college any more, I don't have a lot of money, I'm hungover, I don't want my fries smashed into a sandwich and all I want is a goddamn meal, not some novelty on a plate. \u00a0Pass.", 
      "I'll set the scene...It's Halloween 2008, and you're half-drunkenly walking around dressed as Captain Hammer, with your faithful sidekicks Poison Ivy and 70's guy/Persian night club owner. You're feeling kinda hungry, and what could possibly sound better than a chicken sandwich served on a glazed donut? ...Okay, a lot of things, but you're drunk and willing to eat just about anything. The sandwich is pretty much what you'd expect... it's chicken and a slice of american cheese, served in a glazed donut 'bun'. It's not particularly delicious, but hey, it's food.Okay, back to reality. You probably don't want that donut sandwich ever unless you ARE drunk, or maybe just curious and have a few friends to share it with. I was only there one other time and had the Fat Frat. It wasn't a BAD sandwich... but it wasn't very good either. That's the problem with having so many fried things on a sandwich. They all sort of melt together so all you can taste is the fact that whatever IS on the sandwich is fried. I will probably go back one more time ever, when my brother moves down for college in a few weeks. Ever since I told him about the place he's been jonesing for a sandwich with fried everything.", 
      "I remember drunkenly looking at the first sandwich I got from here, and telling my friend, \"hey dude, I think I have your sandwich...I didn't order fries with mine\".\"Nah man, they all come with fries\".That fact exemplifies the absurdly delicious sandwiches they serve. \u00a0Cheesesteak, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bacon...it's all there. \u00a0I've got to say, though, that they may win the prize for best drunk-ass food on campus. \u00a0It is a bit more expensive than other options, and you'd probably need a heart transplant if you went here twice in one weekend (er...which is what I just did...), but it's undeniable drunk bliss.My only real complaint is that it also takes a while to get the food out. \u00a0Kind of makes sense when you realize all the different components they need to fry to make any of their sandwiches, but the long wait is made more painful when you're wasted and just want something to eat.", 
      "Yesterday was my second of many to come to Fat Sandwich... \u00a0.Great Food, Super Employees, VERY Comfortable N Friendly Atmosphere. As I stood there watching them prepare orders, each sandwich was prepared with care, as if they were fixing them for their selves.The price, compared to what you get is unbelievable..My advise is to either take a friend and split a sandwich or be really, really hungry. Or you can do as I did, make two meals out of it. The Sandwiches warm up real good in a toaster oven...So if you're tired of that hum-grum burger joint... Fat Sandwich is the place for you... \u00a0MamahlfA Very Happy SeniorPS... For all you 1,2,3, Star Raters... Please explain to me why you would go into a place named 'FAT SANDWICH\", THAT LIST FRIED BURGERS, FRENCH FRIES AND OTHER FRIED FOODS.. THAN COMPLAIN THAT THE FOOD IS GREASY, FRIED AND UNHEALTHY... DUH!!!", 
      "I just had the chicken caesar salad wrap. Now, I have a nauseous belly. This place is clean and the staff are friendly enough, but when it comes down to it the food is disgusting. I was also slightly grossed out by parts that were warm, and other parts of the wrap that were totally ice cold.The chance that I come back here is about 0.00000001.", 
      "If you're a health freak, I'd advise you to stay away from Fat Sandwich Company. Otherwise, if you're down to coat the linings of your stomach with fatty oils, do a little damage to your cholesterol, and have the capacity to fit clogged arteries once in a while, this place will do just that for you.This menu items here are unconventional. Imagine a big hot dog bun, filled with things such as fries, mozzarella sticks, chicken nuggets, onion rings, beef patties, bacon, ham, egg, mayo, ranch, ketchup, etc. Gross, right? Well, once in a while you just got to put your guilty conscience aside and set the fireworks in your stomach. Fat Sandwich Company can provide the perfect venue for that. Just go for a long run the day after. I wouldn't advise doing it right after your meal as you'll get pretty darn full.You live life only once. You might as well try their monster challenge... It's as big as a standard NFL football. Finish it by yourself and you get it free.", 
      "Most of the reviews here aren't very fair to this establishment. \u00a0It is what it is, and if you don't want a sandwich stuffed with different fried foods, then you're in the wrong place. \u00a0I've been here after drinking, and it was great. \u00a0Otherwise, I only come here when I am experiencing a particular brand of self-loathing, in which case it is still pretty good. \u00a0The \"Fat Sorostitute\" has been my go-to for the past several visits. \u00a0If you come during the day, while sober, the people that work here will be pretty nice and courteous to you. \u00a0If you come at night, while drunk, they'll be less so. \u00a0I know I couldn't serve drunk people all night without getting a bit mad, so I don't blame them.Also, I suspect the counter is relatively high to keep drunk people from doing something stupid. \u00a0I think this is funny.", 
      "It is what it is, folks. It's terrible-for-you fried food stuffed into a thick doughy, chewy bun/roll/whatever.I do admit that I once went on a 45- minutes road trip with my sorority sister here at 11pm one night just for this and Insomnia Cookies. I got the Fat Sorostitute, natch. I was kinda disappointed...too much bread (I don't really like bread), not enough filling. The jalepe\u00f1o poppers and buffalo tenders were good, but I passed my mozzarella sticks to my friend. I'd come back with my friends but I'd get something different. They have a pretty large menu. I suppose this is good when you're hammered. I went on a weeknight and the guys working were friendly and kind of funny. Hustling a little hard for a tip but I get it.", 
      "The sandwich was ok, but it took them forever to make it...even though there weren't many people there ordering food. \u00a0I think they actually made my sandwich, and then let it sit on the counter for a while (so it could get good and soggy) before calling my name.Other than that, this place just made me feel kind of uncomfortable. \u00a0Not sure how to describe it, other than it's full of bros. \u00a0You know what I'm talking about. \u00a0There was also a really strange conversation between one of the employees and a customer, which included the use of language that clearly offended other people who were there (I was definitely not the only person who was confused). \u00a0I'm guessing the employee and customer must have known each other, but it just seemed inappropriate. \u00a0I feel like if you're over the age of ~19 you probably won't want to be in here, but maybe that's just me.As for the actual food, it was decent. \u00a0Not good enough to make me come back though.", 
      "Terrible. Truly awful.I guess the idea is to give you really heavy food for when you're either drunk or hungover. But - I'd imagine I'd just puke if I was the latter, and I don't think any level of the former would make these sandwiches actually taste good.I'm pretty sure this place was thought up by some stoned frat boys. \"Dude - you know what would be really sweet right now? A sandwich... but with a donut for a bun - with fries not on the side but in the sandwich - and mozzarella sticks and bacon stuffed in for good measure!\"Bad frat boy. Bad.Avoid avoid avoid.", 
      "I think the other reviews are unfair. \u00a0This place does not pretend to be a high-end eatery. \u00a0The food is for college kids who working through a hangover or need to load up for an all-nighter. \u00a0That said, this place does the job. \u00a0I stopped there after a long car ride from BMI airport. \u00a0I was starving so everything tasted good (though \u00a0also had to remove a good amount of the fries to eat the sandwich like another reviewer). \u00a0It did take a really long time to get the sandwich even though the place only had 1 or 2 other customers. \u00a0 I had no problem with the bathrooms but I imagine they are in worse shape on the weekends after everyone's been out to the bar.They have rolls of paper towels at the tables instead of typical paper napkins. \u00a0I did have to use a lot of them after unwrapping my sandwich.Basically a 2 star type of restaurant; sandwich shop/fast food, but it does a 4 star job of it. \u00a0Good, but the food could use a little more 'engineering' to taste better vs just paying for a lot of calories.", 
      "Not entirely sure how a place like this can survive, even on a college campus. They literally take anything that can be deep-fried, put it in a sandwich and then cover it in greasy french fries. I had what I thought was one of the healthier sandwiches, the Fat Luigi. It was a meatball sub with marinara, mozzarella sticks and fries. The upside, beer is cheap. $1.50 for a 312 bottle. Very surprised about that. And $1.25 for can of bud light. They actually ask for tips, which is strange and uncomfortable. Meh. Probably won't go here again.", 
      "The only explanation I have for why this place is still in business is that people hate themselves. The food is awful, the emloyees are usually stoned, and the bathrooms smell like the zoo. The food consists of various types of terrible fried food mashed into a sandwich. Usually when something is that bad for you, there is still some enjoyment that comes with it. Not here. Fat Sandwich steals your soul and crushes your spirit. Don't eat there, for your own good.", 
      "I really only suggest this place when you are tipsy or on the verge of being drunk and are looking for a place to eat. I only say this because if you walk in here sober, your veins and arteries will immediately clog up by the mere smell of grease and you will probably go into cardiac arrest.That being said, Fat Sandwich is probably my go-to (drunk) place when I visit my friends at UIUC (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign). The combination of mozzarella sticks, french fries, mac n cheese bites, and every kind of greasy glory you can imagine on one bun just overwhelms me in the best way possible; and it never disappoints. It's also really nice that every one there is most likely just as drunk as you are, possibly even more intoxicated.My rating for this place while sober: I wouldn't eat here even if it was the last place on earth.My rating while I am incredibly not sober: fuck yeah let's get some fat sandwich.", 
      "It's a Man V. Food type place - has Adam Richman made his way down to U of I yet? there's a fat sandwich with his name all over it.Like one of the reviewers below said, it is what it is. Not a place I can recommend, a donut burger is not food, it is a heart attack waiting to happen. On the menu board, I saw cigarettes and beer delivery service. Freshman 15? at this rate, I'll consider that lucky.My review is not to judge the bad food culture that this place is promoting. The food, on it's own, was average. Sure, it was a fun magic trick, pulling out random chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks covered in ketchup and mayo in a brown bag, but the +45 minute wait for what should be fast food is not okay and the guy who took my order wanted a tip.", 
      "It is what it is- a late night restaurant for the drunk college crowd. My friend had been talking this place up saying it's totally disgusting but totally awesome (and right she was). She insisted we had to go AFTER the bars because I would probably want to murder her if we went sober. So we hit them up at about 2 or 3 in the morning; it was totally packed!I really don't know what I ate, because I just asked them for something without any meat so they hooked me up. Nothing on their menu is meat-free, so you just have to ask when you go in! It had french fries, mac n cheese bites, jalapeno poppers, and mozzarella sticks on a nice french bun. A culinary delight worthy of a michelin star, clearly. It was fun to eat once, I was clearly intoxicated when I ate it which made it even more fun, the staff were really happy to oblige our drunk selves with conversation while they made everyone's sandwiches. Everyone's drunk and passed out all over the place so the place is jam packed with college kids sleeping while their friend waits for their food. I don't think I would dine in at this place. Drunk people aren't clean people, and as such it's kind of icky on the inside because I'm sure the staff just can't keep up with everything. Oh, and no bathroom after 10 pm for anyone. Why? Because idiots ruined bathroom privileges for everyone by gettin' it awwwwwn in the bathroom. Kind of a huge downside when it takes 20 minutes or so to order and get your food.Will I be back? Probably not. Will I crave this sandwich again? Definitely not. Will I tell everyone I know about how disgustingly awesome this place is? Absolutely.", 
      "I'd heard about this place from a few of my devious minions and since I was in the area and spotted it I hit the gas and grabbed the first spot I saw on the street and jumped out. \u00a0I had already researched their menu and had decided on my Fat Sandwhich about a month in anticipation (obsessive? Who me?).The place was clean and \u00a0the staff professional, the Heavy Metal music? \u00a0I'm a fan! \u00a0The Fat Sandwhich I ordered was the Fat MotherClucker; Grilled Chicken, American Cheese, Mayo, Ketchup and of course it is served on an 8\" Amoroso Roll with fries inside. \u00a0Hey I ordered the grilled chicken to keep it healthy of course! \u00a0The sandwhich was fresh, well made and absolutely delicious. \u00a0I couldn't finish it but with a smile on my face and another of their concoctions in mind I will return!", 
      "Honestly, this place is great. Its got \"college behavior\" written all over it and it tastes great; Drunk OR sober. Come in here expecting to feel bad after...or amazing depending on how starved you were. Don't expect little portions. It's a meal inside a bun. And it's an experience everyone should have at U of I.", 
      "Slightly embarrassed to say I have never been to this place intoxicated and am still giving a 4 star review. \u00a0My husband (a U of I grad) and I have been here 4 times over the course of the past few years and have never been disappointed aside from the less than sanitary bathrooms midday. \u00a0The least exciting menu option (in my humble opinion) is my husband's favorite, that being the hasbrown, sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich. \u00a0I try something new everytime, and I even felt compelled to buy a \"What the F\" shirt. \u00a0 Word.", 
      "When I decided to order from Fat Sandwich Company at 1 am, I expected an extremely unhealthy pile of fried foods stuffed into a roll. That's exactly what I got. I ordered the Fat MILF, mostly because I'm immature and anything with bacon on it is probably a winner. I was not drunk \u00a0or high, just hungry. \u00a0Plus, everything else I wanted was closed and FSC seemed like the best remaining choice. As for the sandwich, it was delicious. It was a really big sandwich and took me quite a while to eat, \u00a0but I savored every bit of it. Obviously there are many people who wouldn't enjoy eating a sandwich filled with mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, cheesesteak, bacon, and fries. I am not one of those people. $#!% was amazing. As I ate it, I felt like I was on Epic Meal Time. And that, my friends, is when I knew I found a winner.The only downfall was that it was just warm by the time it got to me. Still delicious, but it would have been even better if I ate it hot.", 
      "Fat sandwich is like a storefront given to the \"brains\" of EpicMealTime or Man v. Food - except everything you buy is a challenge, and they still technically have a challenge.Imagine a hoagie roll filled with everything that you could purchase at Sam's Club that you can realistically deep fry, add condiments, then top with french fries. Then name the sandwich after something that reminds you of a party school with serious collegiate sports teams, i.e. one sandwich is called the \"Fat Tailgate.\"I had said \"Fat Tailgate\" and yes, finished it all - every morsel of cheeseburger, mini corn dogs, ketchup and mustard - yes, while completely conscious at 2 pm. I had a gut trophy afterwards. It was beautiful. I also didn't want to eat for another two days.If you're particularly bold and want to impress me, I dare you to try their food challenge, the Big Fat Ugly. It's two hoagie rolls filled with 4 cheeseburgers, double cheesesteak, chicken cheesesteak, gyro meat, grilled chicken, bacon, sausage, pork roll, mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, chicken nuggets, something cheese bites, fried mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, pizza bites, onion rings, has browns, American cheese, ketchup and mayo. Apparently if you eat this under 15 minutes, it's free.As for ambiance, it's typical for a grease spoon except that you can buy t-shirts. I've seen guys come here after intense gym workouts and families after tailgates.I'm add this to my Central Illinois trumps Chicago list because food like this must be illegal.", 
      "I love the atmosphere! It's laid back, friendly, and the customer service is great! The wait time is a lot shorter than it used to be. They have also added pinball machines(which are a blast from the past)! The food is delicious and exactly what you would expect out of a place with \"fat\" in the name of the restaurant! A University staple and the only place in Champaign that has been on Foodnetwork...how cool is that!", 
      "People read the title of the place Fat Sandwich... Don't go there for a salad, if you want healthy food go to the subway that is close. Jeez people everyone is giving unfair reviews people there are very nice and give you what you ask 30k in a sandwich", 
      "i can proudly say that when i was in college over my time there i ate every single sandwich on the menu (back when my body could take the abuse). Best sandwichs on the menu. Fat F, Fat MILF (best), Fat Sorastitute, Fat Cowboy, and a few others i can't recall. Worst are Fat Caesar and Fat Falafel, bleh those were nasty. This is a college staple and where you have to go if you have never been their before. Grab a six pack and drink while you wait. Eat it while its fresh it will turn nasty in your fridge. place is packed when bars close but empty just about any other time. Its super unhealthy but will sober you up in a minute. Good and Bad, at night they will take your name then call it when your sandwich is ready, BUT, they will ask you what you ordered. Its really hard to remember after a night of drinking so concentrate! They do it because people try to steal sandwiches.",

      "Positively horrendous. The food is sickening, greasy, stale, and in horrid combinations (mozzarella sticks and chicken nuggets and mayonnaise and fries on a donut bun? really?) The tables are never wiped off or cleaned, and we had to sit in these gross chairs with used kleenexes tossed everywhere which we grudgingly had to pick up and throw out ourselves. My friend used the restroom and reported that her shoes stuck to the floor with every step. The entire place was swarming with flies. It Was Very Bad.", 
      "A true American icon. \u00a0People ask where our culture is, and I point to Fat Sandwich. \u00a0Nothing better encapsulates the uniquely American perspective that, if things are good independently, they must be better together. \u00a0In high school civics you called it the melting pot. \u00a0Now that you're in college, call it a Fat Sorostitute, tzatziki and hot sauce. \u00a0Some day you'll know it as manifest destiny. \u00a0God Bless America.",

      "I'm always impressed with Chinese food down in Champaign, and this place definitely leaves me feeling the same. The menu is huge and posted on the wall (and there are menus). I'm so overwhelmed on what to order as everything seems delicious! The prices may seem a bit high at first, HOWEVER, they don't accept tip and it is sort of self-served (they will bring out the food to you though). I love how they have real authentic Chinese food with varying regional styles. This particular visit, we ordered their specialty tofu dish with soy sauce and scallions, a pork soup, drunken shrimp, and fried rice. LOVED the flavors although they were a bit salty for my taste, but some rice takes care of that. The tofu was crisped perfectly and the soy sauce is thick and filled with aromatic flavors from the garlic and scallions. The pork soup was nice, it is Taiwanese style and authentic. Haven't been able to find that soup elsewhere in the states yet. The drunken shrimp was spot on with the cooking wine and herbs. The shrimp meat was fresh as well! However, I recommend to skip the fried rice here, nothing really special whatsoever.Probably will drop by this place every time I visit the area. Give it a try!", 
      "Sesame Balls: \u00a0awesomeHot and Sour soup: \u00a0below average. \u00a0Great number of veggies but broth not to my taste.The crispy tofu was great but would be better if it was done a little more on the inside", 
      "Golden Harbor is as authentic and good Chinese food as you will get outside of Chinatown. Their most famous dish is their crispy tofu, which is delicious. These three dishes below are excellent:-Crispy Fish Fillet With Wulur Sauce-Taiwanese Salt and Pepper Chicken-Crispy Tofu (signature tofu)Their menu has a great variety of dishes. Even better, you don't even have to pay tip! There is only a $1 cleaning fee per person, which makes it a great place for large parties that would otherwise have to pay 18% gratuity. Wow, no tip? That's how you know you've found authentic Chinese. THAT'S how they do it in China; trust me.", 
      "I'm almost tempted to give this restaurant 5/5 just for their no-tip policy, but that wouldn't exactly be a fair way to review restaurants. You write your order on the pad yourself, so you can take as long as you want (which could be a while, given the enormous selection). You also seat yourself and pour your own water, but you don't have to clean up afterwards. One note about tipping: unlike some restaurants that claim to not accept tips but then add an automatic 18% gratuity to all orders (not just parties with 6+ people), this place actually practices the real meaning of no tipping. As in, if you order something from the menu that's $20, you only pay $22 (after tax). This is how it should be - \"forced tipping\" is not \"no tipping\".I have only been here once, so I've only tried two of the dishes out of the 1300 or so on their giant wall mural of a menu (only for those who can read Chinese). But those two dishes were excellent.Oh, and the lack of tips doesn't mean service here is bad. The girl at the counter is really friendly and the rest of the staff keep the tables clean. Food comes out faster than most places.", 
      "Best chinese in town . Only problem is that I have to wait long to place order. try three cup chicken, fried whole fish, steamed bread with meat. They have too many dishes. \u00a0It is better for you to stay with what you like. There is risk to try new dishes", 
      "I ordered the following dish from the chinese menu:241. \u8fa3\u7092\u8089\u9165 \u00a0 \u00a0Crispy Shredded Pork with Hot Oilgoldenharbor.weebly.com/\u2026I received soggy (rather than crispy) sliced pork with a not-so savory (or spicy) sauce, NO dry chilis, NO chili oil, but some cilantro....I asked for chili oil, and the girl that runs the register brought it out, saw this dish I was served (she took the order, commented on the choice of dish, we talked, etc. at the register), yet said or did nothing.It could be the pictures on their website are incorrect, or that I somehow angered the wait staff or cooks (not likely). Either way, they should get it together. Considering the expense of their meals - which would be good, if you are served what they lead you to believe your ordering, they should at least get it right.", 
      "Best Chinese restaurant here in champaign Urbana. Great foods, great service. Try it if you like Chinese food.", 
      "this is the best Chinese food I've ever had. \u00a0The Crispy Tofu was outstanding and seasoned very nicely. Since I will probably never visit here again, I also ordered a small portion of the Taiwanese Salt and Pepper Chicken. It wasn't as good as the tofu, but certainly flavorful. I was already full from the large portion of tofu, so that may have affected my judgement. \u00a0The staff was very pleasant and helped me order even though I didn't follow the simple directions posted at the door. \u00a0If this is authentic Chinese food, I am a big fan!The Jasmine tea was free and lovely. The amount of food for $20 could have fed two hungry adults.UPDATE: After dinner I got very sick to my stomach... \u00a0I'm not sure if it was MSG or something else in the food. \u00a0Although the crispy tofu tasted very good, I'm downgrading to four stars based on the lasting after effects and the mediocre Salt and Pepper Chicken.", 
      "Stopped while driving through town. \u00a0The food is very good but OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE.They have a station set up so the customer fills out their own order and turns it in at the cashier (weird).Good but not worth the money.", 
      "Great food, but long line.We waited for about an hour. However, they are delicious and fresh. Not so sweet.", 
      "Average at best Chinese place. The service here was poor. No one asked or cared that I was in to eat. If you don't know what you're doing no one will assist you. You have to ask for everything. The food is a tad pricey for the quality. The portions are descent but the overall quality of the food is flawed. Very bland at best. The Mongolian Beef was nothing to brag about, nether was the curry chicken. I was hoping for better tasting food but experienced average at best.", 
      "Golden Harbor serves decent chinese food at upscale prices. They have a very intimidating menu on the wall with over a thousand items, but don't let it scare you. Most of the dishes here are not bad. The giant menu is a source of both strength and weakness though, as many of the dishes are just meh.If you come here, you can't go wrong with the Crispy Tofu.", 
      "The menu here is ridiculous. I have a hard time choosing what to get! Also, the authentic Chinese menu is way better than the American menu. This is one of those places where it's definitely worth it to take a risk and try something new! Things I like:Sesame Balls: Interestingly sweet and delightful!Garlic Beef: Nothing too special, but a good addition to supplement a large group meal with many dishes. American-style Sesame Chicken: Eh. Crispy Tofu: LOVE. A little bland, but I love the sauce and the texture!Chinese-Style Pork Fried Rice: Hands down best fried rice I've ever had. It's not all over cooked and doused in soy sauce like many asian food places have. The rice is still moist and soft, and the eggs are cooked fresh. Also, the meat still has some juicyness to it. AWESOME.Rangoons: These only have cheese in them. I wish they had crab. Typical rangoons, really.American Chicken Lo-Mein: Typical Lo-Mein, but really good!I can't wait to come back again and try new things!", 
      "I am going to keep this review short and sweet. I have had a lot of Chinese here in Chicago, but this place beats them all. I love GOLDEN HARBOR. I have never been disappointed with any of their dishes. Here are some of my favorites:// Crispy tofu - must try. I think its amazing and light. My one Chinese friend informed me that this was NOT the best he has ever had but I don't believe him. // Szechwan beef - This might be my favorite dish. The meat is so tender, you would never believe it came from a Chinese restaurant. Ha!// Sesame ball - these are stuffed with red bean paste. I can't tell if they are a dessert or an appetizer. Either way it is delicious// Hot and Sour soup & Egg drop Soup - the MSG is to die for... haha I think i like the Egg drop soup a little more. The consistency is soo perfect. All in all, go to this place. SO GOOD.", 
      "Absolutely fantastic place, so many options and all of them excellent! Also, although coming here with Chinese friends definitely helps, the fact that they have a translated version of the Chinese menu (as opposed to just an Americanized menu) means that even if nobody in your group knows Chinese you can still order interesting, authentic dishes. That said, definitely come as a group, as large as possible, and sit at one of the tables with a wheel in the center. The portions are large, and its great to share and try different things. Personal favorites here are the famous Crispy Tofu, anything with rice noodles (they do them perfectly), and what they call casseroles in English.", 
      "The best Chinese food I've tasted in the US. Thousands of items on the Chinese language menu, and quite a lot of them on the English menu(s) too. Recommend Crispy Basil Chicken, Signature tofu, Crispy eggplant, mala \u00a0and numb oil dishes, beef tendons, and many others!", 
      "There was some time, in what seems like ages ago, that I lived immediately outside Chinatown in Chicago. While Chicago is certainly not known for having the best gathering of Chinese food in the country, we certainly made do with some wonderful meals. The short of it: going to Golden Harbor makes me feel like I'm back in the city. I absolutely loved the food. I loved it so much that I'm currently laying on the couch because I can't move. It's good stuff, Maynard. I scoured the reviews and we ordered most of what others liked: crispy tofu (good, but I probably wouldn't order it again); crispy chicken basil (amazing with just the right amount of kick!); salt and pepper prawns (OMG salt and pepper anything, really, but these were great and had some kick, too); 1/2 Peking duck (okay, they give you tortillas instead of pancakes which kind of sucked but the hoisin and scallions were great and the duck - OMG - the duck! so moist and perfectly fried); Chinese pork fried rice (decent, I suppose, but didn't have a ton of flavor without soy sauce -- but, to be fair, I'm not a huge fried rice lover); steamed BBQ buns (always good, of course); and my brother got the general tso's chicken (not normally a fan of this dish because I think it's too sweet, but this version was less sweet and I really liked it). \u00a0Sophie at the front was maybe the most adorable girl ever and so helpful. :] She even threw in a thing of sesame balls that were incredible. So unique tasting and their sweetness was surprising. The menu is overwhelming and the seating is chaotic. I'm glad we took our food home with us to enjoy. I get panicky in places such as this sometimes, and I certainly couldn't have picked what to eat without the help of the yelp reviews; the menu is like 20 pages long and an anxiety sufferer's worst nightmare. This is what keeps me from giving it a full five stars. Next time I'm in chambana visiting my brother, I will certainly go back. Bravo, GH. Thank you for restoring my faith in Chinese cuisine.", 
      "I am visiting from out of town and came here on a Friday night around 7 p.m. When I first walked in, it was kind of confusing about what to do, until I realized you must order at the counter and seat yourself. They have a large menu in red paper on the wall and then printed menus in English to order from. I was impressed by the number of vegetarian items on the menu--more than I usually see at most Chinese restaurants. I got a small order of the Crispy Tofu since that menu item was highlighted on Yelp. Unfortunately, even though the small was $7, it was seriously barely any food. We are talking appetizer size portion. I definitely should of asked about portion size before ordering, but I am used to Chinese menu items that are not dim sum to have large portions. So while my crispy tofu was tasty, I'm still friggin hungry! Aside from the small portion size of my crispy tofu, the building was not heated sufficiently so I was not comfortably warm eating at my table (it's freezing outside today).Summary: not super impressed with the small portion sizes and the underheated dining room during the winter months.", 
      "Their best item is the crispy tofu. They also have great eggplant. The portions aren't as big as the ones I get back in SoCal but this place is arguably one of the best Chinese sit down restaurants in Champaign.", 
      "My husband and I decided to give them a shot based on the reviews here. \u00a0We had a difference of opinion. \u00a0The food was very authentic and was very good. \u00a0The decor was piss poor and left a lot to be desired. \u00a0I go for the complete experience and he prefers to focus on the food.The food was very good. \u00a0The service was also very good. \u00a0However, it was confusing when you come in because no one helped us and we stood there for a moment before we figured out what to do. \u00a0You have to ask for an English menu. They have WAY to many tables crammed into the room. \u00a0You have no room to move around.Although, they do have large family tables with the rotating lazy Susan in the center for 10 to 15 people. \u00a0The problem is that they have too many of those tables.All in all, I think we will give them another try.", 
      "KISS, keep it simple students. So simple, but oh so yummy. \u00a0Was sad when Pickles closed, but after too many years I finally tried what took its place. \u00a0Followed yelp reviews and had crispy tofu and pork fried rice. Great serving size and both very simple but good. Not super bang for buck but very fair prices. More people with more dishes to share seem to be the way to go. \u00a0Also bring cash to save 5%.", 
      "We have a weekly tradition of family style dinner with friends at GH and wouldn't change a thing about it. We were introduced to this place by a friend of the family that owns it - which was fortunate because we had plenty of help navigating the extensive & extremely diverse traditional menu. In short, the portions are large (hence family style dining), food is very flavorful, and you'll be rewarded for trying new things! If you avoid peak times (dinner Fri & Sat), there is rarely a long line to order & food comes out fast (& piping hot!). If there is a wait, it's still well worth it!Our favorite dishes are salt and pepper chicken, spicy green beans with pork, crispy beef with garlic, pork belly buns, crispy tofu and sesame balls for dessert - just to name a few. Hot jasmine tea is complimentary and it is BYOB so we typically bring a bottle of plum wine along, too. (Am-Ko carries a nice selection of plum wine and is right around the corner.) This is a great place to come with a group of friends (lots of big tables), pick out a handful of new dishes and eat family style. Enjoy!", 
      "This place makes living in Champaign worth it!As far as I'm concerned this is the best Chinese food restaurant in Champaign! Their ordering process is a little bizarre at first, but once you get used to it, it gets better!I don't read Chinese but I've gone with people who do. I write down numbers that I like and order the same items later. Tina, who works there, does a GREAT job deciphering what I've ordered before as well. I've been known to say \" I had this great chicken dish last time but I don't know what it is.\" I'll describe what it looks like and she's like \"Ding! I know what it is.\" Tina has also given me great recommendations as well. More than once she's said \"If you like X, give Y a try!\" I end up ordering both X and Y and Y always becomes my new favorite dish! My favorites are:1) Potato strings with green peppers2) Snow fish with soy3) Crispy Tofu 4) Desert PorkI love that I always have leftovers for at least two more meals after eating at Golden Harbor! What a great way to stretch my dollar!", 
      "Moments like this, I wish Yelp would allow users to rate 4.5 stars.No complaints, food was definitely delicious, service was fine since it isn't really wait-staff, but I've had better food as well. Basically, it would be a strong contender in Chinatown, but it wouldn't be the best.", 
      "Yumyum in the tumtum wouldnt go else where for tuntum feeding through under my gumgum.Get the dong puo lohMore taiwanese traditional dishesThe owner is taiwanese and always feels great to be able to speak in a native tongue. But really good food and friendly with big smiles from everyone", 
      "OMG, this place reminds me of mom's home cooking.The stewed chicken in Szechuan sauce is out of this world. \u00a0This dish alone reminds me of mom, dad and us 9 kids eating dinner at the table.Has just enough salt to add flavor, spiciness to give it that lovely kick and a hint of lemongrass to remind me of home.The pork belly was good but not great, I would order it again. \u00a0The star of anise was a bit overpowering.The time it takes to prepare these wonderful dishes are amazing, considering the size of this place and the volume they are very quick.Highly recommend it!", 
      "10/10 delicious, authentic chinese food.try the duck tongue! they are like tiny chicken wings (thats how you eat them)it's a tip included, discount with cash kind of joint, and perfect for parties. i highly recommend rounding up ten people, grab a chinese menu, each ordering a different dish and then sharing!", 
      "Seriously the best Chinese food I have ever had in my whole life. I have come here time after time and it just keeps on getting better from here. The crispy tofu is a must even if you don't like tofu it's so good the pan fried noodles yes yes yes and don't get me started about the duck . I highly recommend this place. It's can't get any more authentic than this also Tina is such a sweet person (owner) if you want to take a large group out to eat this is the place to go even if you are going for a small gathering", 
      "Most of the meals here are good and they have different food for Chinese and non-Chinese people. Without a doubt, the Chinese menu is much better than the English version. The food is fast it is popular in both Chinese and non Chinese people.", 
      "Haha.. I used to go to school here and have known this family for years now. \u00a0I did all my years in grad school and undergrad knowing that I was going to be fed fairly well at Mandarin Wok.. which turned into the place in Mohamet.. and now Golden Harbour.Tina and her mother.. and her father (the cook) have turned the small pop and mom shop into a vision of something that can take care of a large crowd comfortably. \u00a0I visited the new location.. tea pots for you to do it yourself. \u00a0And you write your own order on the sheet.. and voila.. amazing!!I live in LA and have lived in Boston.. and there are some things you can not get anywhere else. \u00a0For example.. the famous crispy tofu. \u00a0Easy to make but seriously.. have never seen it anywhere else. \u00a0Their spicy fish and their Chinese cucumber is divine as well. \u00a0I did not get their three cup chicken this time but it's been years since I have had something as good as theirs.If it's any indication.. all the Chinese professors that work at UIUC have their own account there.. are willing to drive there.. and LOVE it. \u00a0You won't be dissapointed. \u00a0Well unless you order from the non-Chinese menu.. then you're on your own. \u00a0But if you don't read Chinese.. just tell Tina what you like and she'll take care of you.", 
      "There should be a 10-star in Yelp! I am in love with this place. The food the staff everything is awesome about this place. I really really recommend the fried fish with vulur sauce. I have eaten at a lot of different chinese all over the US but to date have found none that come close to this place in flavor!", 
      "I can't let myself give this 5 stars because I've had better, however, I do think it's really delicious in its own unique way. The taste is very different compared to other Chinese restaurants in Champaign, IL and I think this has got to be the best around. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.I've ordered the noodles mostly but have tried other items like the chicken fried rice (that was okay, pretty plain), pan fried noodles with pork (too much ginger for my taste), and some Singapore noodles which were really great!I want to try the other items but it can be a bit overwhelming when ordering. There are SO many options. It also is a lot pricier than it should be but what can you expect. Also, if you pay in cash you pay 5% less or something.", 
      "The food here is pretty excellent - lots and lots of choices, and nothing I have had here has ever been bad. \u00a0The ordering process is a bit goofy at first, but you get used to it. \u00a0My only gripes are that it's very, very drafty in here in the wintertime and the parking lot is screwy.", 
      "Suggest big party to go there. So that everyone can pay less and try more! Dishes are fairly good.", 
      "I've been here a few times in the past, but my most recent experience warranted a five-star review.I ordered on the phone during lunch on my way out of work, and the woman who answered the phone was so nice! I know that the woman who works the front counter there is great at interpreting what you want and helping you order, but I wasn't expecting such thorough service on the phone! She made sure I was ordering exactly what I wanted (and asked me if I wanted the authentic Chinese recipe- of course I do!) Then, she offered to have it ready in ten minutes, or hold the order until a time of my choosing.I got there and met the nice lady who took my order, who immediately recognized me. She greeted me, and I paid in cash, receiving a \u00a0small discount! The entire time, she was smiling and making me feel very welcome. She gave me my food, which was all ready to go, and said \"enjoy, it's all nice and hot.\" A huge component of my job is customer service, and this experience was A+ customer service.Of course, as we all know, the food was amazing! My \"lunch\" portion for $7 was enough food for me to fill up now, and still save half for whenever I want it later. I've been around to the other Chinese restaurants in the area that have very good reviews, and they are good, but not quite as good as the Golden Harbor.The only negative point is that it is hard for me to justify ordering the same thing I always get each time, as I know whatever I order will be fantastic!", 
      "\"Why didn't you take us here earlier?\" - My dadI've been at UIUC for 4 years, and in my last summer, I finally went to Golden Harbor. My parents visited me, and we have visited our fair share of local restaurants. This is probably one of the best things I have ever had. The Crispy Basil Chicken is the best variation of fried chicken I've had here in my time in the land of fried foods. I also had mixed vegetables with seaweed and shrimp-filled wonton soup, which were also glorious.I love my tea, and the fact that it is free and self-serve for pots of jasmine tea make my inner Uncle Iroh happy.", 
      "The food here is expensive, and the portion sizes aren't that large for the price. \u00a0For example, I ordered the crispy egg tofu, and it was essentially a tube of tofu cut up and fried, not worth the 10+ dollars for something that I could buy at a super market for $3. \u00a0It should have been priced at $7. I didn't like the orderihttps://www.yelp.com/writeareview/biz/t_\u00adyiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA?return_url=%2Fbiz%2Ft_\u00adyiQnxUDdPPCN2z4QyezA#ng system either.", 
      "Honestly, this place is great. Has extremely authentic Chinese food. The restaurant has moved multiple times from being a extremely small shack in a nearby small town to a much bigger location, where it is now. Extremely good, but sometimes the food is definitely not as good because of the number of customers.", 
      "I've just been forced to concede that, despite still not digging their ordering process, their food is just too good to disrespect with a 2 star review.", 
      "I don't write many five star reviews. \u00a0 And didn't really expect good Chinese food in such a small town. \u00a0 \u00a0The service is sit down cafeteria style. \u00a0 \u00a0You write your table's order on an order pad and pay at the front counter. \u00a0 The give you a table number and bring the food right out. \u00a0 \u00a0Very easy and low stress way to dine, though perhaps it may confuse some.Tea and water are provided for free. \u00a0 This restaurant is BYOB, and there's a nice liquor store next door.PROS: \u00a0 Amazingly authentic menu! \u00a0 I've lived in China and traveled there extensively, and found many of my old favorites on the menu. \u00a0 (A Chinese menu is posted on the wall with item numbers that correspond to the English language menus.) \u00a0 \u00a0I got to enjoy food I've haven't had in years and never thought I'd find in the US -- great stuff from several regions of China. \u00a0 \u00a0I also enjoyed some items that I hadn't had before, or had enjoyed in slightly different forms. \u00a0 The crispy tofu for which this restaurant is so well-known is a fun item that everyone should try. \u00a0 The pork bun is amazing! \u00a0Well-seasoned fatty deliciousness. \u00a0 \u00a0So many items to try. \u00a0 I wish I lived in the area.CONS: \u00a0 None at all. \u00a0 I hope this place never changes."

      "Great authentic Chinese food but the restaurant has a different system than other Chinese restaurant. It's a self service restaurant - u write down ur order on the order pad and give to the cashier. Pay with cash as they charge u cc transaction fee if u use one. Also they charge u for table cleaning fee ($.50 per person ). \u00a0Water and jasmine tea are free.Endless options of food - from general tso chicken to sea cucumber. Crispy tofu seemed popular so I tried and it was very good - love the sauce!! We also had duck with bun , pork with black pepper (lots of black pepper), general tso chicken, seafood hot pot( this is different than what people would \u00a0normally call a hot pot), prawn with sweet chili sauce, wonton soup, egg drop soup, fried dumpling, and cheese ragoon ( no crab in it). In general, everything was good and tasty!!If you can go earlier, that's better so that way you don't have to complete for a table and wait in line to order \u00a0:) Again, their menu is huge so this is place you have go over and over to try different \u00a0food!", 
      "ZOMG. \u00a0A good Chinese place in the middle of nowhere? \u00a0Okay, it's not nowhere, but it sure as hell ain't SF!Great authentic dishes-- ribs, mushrooms and greens, crispy duck, Prices = moderatePay in cash and you get 5% off. \u00a0 They accept some plastic too.Service = friendly but they're too busy to really check on you. \u00a0Plus it's mostly self service, so no need to tip either!", 
      "OK, here is the procedure for non-Chinese folks;1- Walk up to the front desk and grab menus, an order pad and a table number card. 2- Sit down and pick something to eat. You have 975 (no joke) choices of authentic Chinese/Taiwanese dishes. If you end up chosing sweet and sour chicken you deserve a slow fiery death.3- Write your entree number and the quantity (figure on getting one entree per person and having leftovers, unless you are super-hungry. You will get rice with the entree) and return the order to the lady at the cash register, who will take your money.4- That lady will give you glasses for water and direct you to where the tea is.5- Wait 10 min or so. Don't fret, they will bring your chopsticks and napkins.6- Enjoy the shit out of your yummy vittles. Don't forget to share, as no matter how freaking good your selection is, whatever your fellow diner got is just as good.I've had the Salt and Pepper Shitake Mushrooms (they are not on the menu, but the lady at the counter knows what you are talking about) and the Crispy Tofu as featured at champaign-taste.blogspot\u2026 These two are freaking divine. The tofu was the absolute best I've ever had.", 
      "Some lame person flagged my review and it got pulled. Take 2. Don't let the \"authentic Chinese\" in the title fool you. The standout food at Golden Harbor is authentic, homestyle Taiwanese dishes. Also for those who are interested, this is the rough history of the owners' time in the area:(Pre-2000 - 2004) \u00a0Mandarin Wok(2005 - ? ) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Cravings (Drastically different from its current state)(? - early 2010) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Wok in Mahomet(Mid-2010 - \u00a0 \u00a0 ) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Golden HarborI'm in the area approximately once an year and this is on my must-try list (along with Jarling's Custard Cup). I left the area in 2005 and the owner still recognizes me... Ask all the alumni that have passed through the doors of the original Mandarin Wok and they'll tell you in all of their worldly travels, they haven't found a crispy tofu as good as the one here. Go easy on the service and ambience - the food is worth it.A friend made reservations for me since it sometimes gets busy. You get a table # and look for your table # on arrival and use it to place your order. With each order, you get a big bowl of rice (based on the number of diners), plates, fortune cookies, and chopsticks. I think the prices may have gone up over the years, but I guess certain items are harder to come by in Champaign. The overwhelming Chinese menu on the wall is supposedly fully translated into English (look for the menus on the lefthand side). I'm not sure how complete the translated menu is. And for those who prefer Chinese-American takeout food, I believe those items are still available. You don't have to tip because you're expected to clean up your own table.My order:809 Crispy tofu (let me know if you figure out the recipe to the sauce)204 Spicy basil chicken balls876 Chinese cabbage (gotta have some veggies!)2000 Chicken rolls", 
      "Before I get into the food, I have to say that one of the _greatest_ things about eating here (or getting things delivered/to go) is the service. \u00a0Talk about bend over backwards! \u00a0You want them to do Princess Chicken with sliced carrots and a side of sauce? \u00a0You got it! \u00a0You want your fried noodles with a side of pea shoots and baby won-tons? \u00a0You got it! \u00a0Okay, wait... that last one I might be making up, but the first, dude... I get it every time!Alls I'm saying is-- these people will do everything to make your order, NAY, your EXPERIENCE something awesome. \u00a0And that's a restaurant I can get behind!The food is excellent. \u00a0Rice is the perfect consistency (not too dry, but not wet, either). \u00a0Their sauces are incredible (try the Princess for a spicy kick, or the Empress for something a little spicy-sweet). \u00a0Their veg is even good in my book, diced or sliced thin, not overbearing! \u00a0Everything is just hot, and yummy, and delicious and my favorite, not too hard on the wallet.Golden Harbor is located in the old Pickles location (trust me, a Champaign paragon in its day), so it's pretty much central to Champaign, Urbana, AND Savoy. Tell them where you're coming from when you order and they'll make sure the food is separated out in containers that keep things from getting soggy on the way. Whether you choose to eat in (now that they have the ventilation under control) or decide to carry-out, Golden Harbor Authentic is one of the best Chinese places you can choose in C-U.", 
      "That giant menu on the wall that you can't read because it's in Chinese - just close your eyes and pick something. Secret menus always guarantee great food.Maybe you're not that adventurous? It's ok, I don't judge. Just make sure you go with an experienced Golden Harbor-er (or someone that can read Chinese), because not everything on their giant menu is listed on the English one. Whatever you choose to devour, and you will cause this place is DIVINE, make sure you don't skip the crispy tofu ($10). It is THE best in the world...yes, capital T.H.E. BEST. Not a fan of tofu? Eh, your loss!Try not to crave this place on a Monday (I know, I know, it's hard), but don't do it! You'll pull up and have your heart broken to see that it's closed on Mondays. They also close from 3-4:30pm everyday, everyone needs a lunch break, y'know? So plan accordingly. UGH. SO GOOD.", 
      "everyone is blinded by the tofu, for a place that is considered \"the best chinese food place is uiuc area\" I wondered: \"would it be possible to have crummy dishes?\" When I went my first (and only) time to this place. I ordered meatless udon pan-fried noodles w/mushrooms and Satay tofu. When I ordered I assumed \"what could go wrong?\", everyone has had good things to say about this shack; so anything/everything should be good.. Well, let me tell you...I was Wrong!The pan fried noodles were at most sauteed, but definitely not pan fried; for they were slimy and were practically tasteless (besides the stinky mushrooms that shaped the horrid taste-- and to think i thought i loved mushrooms) The satay tofu was bland and mainly tasted like an orifice or a dirty mouth (it had such a weird/nasty taste to it). The only way I could barely eat half of what I ordered was by drowning it in Eel Sauce I had in my refrigerator.Maybe this is my fault from ordering from the translated menu? Maybe it's my fault for being an American? All i know is that, if that is what authentic chinese food tastes like thheeen...WT eff??? THEN I will gladly stick with the American aspect of chinese food, because I totally wasted $20 (on a bulk load of crap)...It was really bad, possibly some of the worst food I ever had in my life (and it's not like I ordered pig tongue! I ordered totally basic items!). All i know is that it's pretty sad when the only good thing i had in my order was the steamed white rice.After this experience I \u00a0really hope I just managed to order the two crappiest dishes from this place; if not, that was a sad excuse for food and I was a sure sucker for paying $20 for it.", 
      "We come here every time we're in the area. The food is always good and portions big. Service is very friendly. \u00a0The menu is in Chinese and is very intimidating to a non-speaker, so I'd suggest coming with someone who can read it! English menu seems limited next to it. Today, we had beef soup noodles, beef chao fan, crispy tofu, white boiled fish (english translation), and soy sauce eggs with ground meat. This was plenty of food for our party of 4. The beef chao fan and soup noodles were just okay. Chao fan was over sauced and on the salty side. The soup noodles were too soft and the broth was bland. Soy sauce eggs were alright as well- surrounding meat and sauce was very salty, and eggs themselves needed more flavor. The crispy tofu was delicious as always- love this dish, and order it every time. I highly recommend it! The white boiled fish sounds better in chinese, but the dish itself was excellent. Soft pillows of fish- very light. Overall, our meal was decent here. Because of our small group we didn't have some of our favorites like the braised pork belly buns. We will be back for more cheap yet good chinese good in the future!", 
      "I love eating at Golden Harbor! The owners of this place used to own Mandarin Wok and Cravings. They have also owned restaurants in Taiwan as well, so I always come here when I need a taste of home. When I first walked in, I was overwhelmed by the extensive Chinese menu that is plastered on the wall. There are so many dishes to choose from. There is also an English menu as well. The entrees are pretty pricey, but you get a large portion. I recommend bringing friends to split the bill so you can try more dishes!Things to try:-crispy tofu-sacha lamb-three cup chicken-hou fun-taiwanese pork soup (forgot the actual name)Overall, great authentic Taiwanese food! A must try!", 
      "Okay, Golden Harbor is not only the best Chinese place in the area, but I think it's also a contender for best restaurant PERIOD. \u00a0I love coming here with a bunch of people so I can try lots of different dishes. \u00a0I keep getting surprised by Golden Harbor and how consistently amazing it is. \u00a0Some of me and my husband's favorites, just off the top of my head: \u00a0yellow bean fish, crispy tofu, crispy duck with dipping sauce (the sauce becomes gelatinous when cooled; a good thing, it means they probably use some kind of stock in it), three cup chicken, softshell crab with hot oil and basil, and meatless eggplant with house garlic sauce.", 
      "This is a sweet place. So many people recommended it to me and it took my two years to finally go.My party ordered:Braised Beef (excellent)Crispy Tofu (yum)Three Cup Chicken (my favorite)Steamed Fish (HOT -temp)Dumplings (it was okay - definitely NOT homemade - probably from the package)Service? There isn't any except people bringing out your food. You pick out what you want, write it down on a piece if paper and go up to pay/order. Food came out fast and it was so good! Their chinese menu is extensive (which makes me happy because it reminds me of my mother's cooking). I highly recommend this place. BEST sit-down Chinese place!", 
      "While Golden Harbor lacks the atmosphere and service of many \"fine dining\" restaurants in town, it compensates with over 100 different dishes brimming in flavorful sauces and expertly prepared meats, vegetables, and other Chinese specialties. \u00a0The restaurant serves everything from popularized American dishes (e.g., General Tso's chicken, fried rice) to more \"exotic,\" authentic cuisine (e.g., frog legs, \"stinky\" tofu).Of the items I've tried so far, I've really enjoyed the (legendary) crispy tofu and crispy beef in pepper sauce. \u00a0The dumplings were a little disappointing as they seemed like a standard pre-made frozen product rather than something made in-store (though honestly, I think most Asian places in town serve pre-made dumplings). \u00a0Unfortunately, they also seem to run out of leafy vegetables fairly often, so consider yourself lucky if you have the opportunity to sample the traditional Chinese vegetables. The woman who usually works the register speaks English very well and can be helpful if you are overwhelmed by the menu options. \u00a0Even though the menu is translated into English, the names of dishes are not always very descriptive (\"What's the difference between spicy chicken and chicken in hot sauce?\"), so you can just ask her for advice.For vegetarians, there is a clearly marked section of veg-friendly dishes on the back of the English menu. \u00a0This guarantees that your Chinese dinner will be free of chicken broth or other cleverly-masked animal products. \u00a0However, given the limited number of items listed in this section, I would also encourage vegetarians to browse the rest of the menu. \u00a0For whatever reason, there are veg-friendly dishes (marked with a cute cabbage icon) in the regular menu that are not included in the vegetarian section.The only disadvantage of Golden Harbor is that it does not yet offer a take-out or online version of their menu. \u00a0While they still allow customers to pick up food to go, you will probably have to place your order in-person at the restaurant, or already know what you want if you plan to call in advance.", 
      "I was a bit apprehensive after seeing their 200+ menu items. Usually a place that serves so many dishes does a sub par job on all of them but that was not the case here. Went with a party of 6 and ordered enough food to feed a small army. We actually ordered so much food... i can't even remember all the dishes we had. The owner was very nice and accommodating. I accidentally ordered the basil chicken thinking it was the salt and pepper chicken and the owner brought out the salt and pepper chicken gratis! You can definitely tell that this is the type of establishment that maintains customer loyalty. We ended up eating the food leftovers for 2 additional meals with food to spare. I wish this restaurant was in nyc... i would def be a regular...I would recommend some dishes but i really don't think you can go wrong here... try them all if you can!", 
      "Just like many of these reviews echo, Golden Harbor is an awesome place to get Chinese food. It is on the pricier side running about $10-15 per person if you go family style, but it's definitely worth it. They are the old owners of Mandarin Wok and the restaurant that was in Mahomet. They cater to all different styles of Chinese food.PROs- They have a thoroughly comprehensive menu. Whatever you can think of in terms of Chinese food, they can make it.- The lady behind the counter is AWESOME at catering to what you want. If you describe it in half mandarin / half English or even pure English, she can tell you what you're looking for. If you're looking for a suggestion of what to eat, she can list off a bunch of dishes and ask you if you like it spicy / non-spicy or a certain style.CONs- You have to clean up your own dishes. It's a place where they are so busy they just don't have time to do it. If you don't enjoy doing this aspect of it, there are lots of other places around town that will do it for you.- The wait can be a long time. If you go during peak hours which is basically the major meal times on weekends, you can expect to wait from 30 minutes to an hour just to order your food and then an additional half hour to get your food. They only have a couple of chefs so it takes awhile to get your food, but it's usually delicious.- Again, you're going to pay $$ for it and you're not going to fill up completely until you spend about $10-15 per person.- The atmosphere is noisy so it's not exactly a great place to go for a quiet date.I typically order:- Crispy Tofu - a soft tofu on the inside but crunchy on the outside that comes with a garlic sauce and green onions on top.- The fish fillets with garlic sauce - just as it's described, most people that like seafood like this.- Three cups Chicken - if you ask for it extra spicy and like spicy stuff, people generally like it.The food quality goes beyond any measure of any local Chinese restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area making this place WELL worth it if you're looking for chinese food in the area.", 
      "You know it is an authentic Chinese restaurant when the menu is in Chinese. My friends begged me to go with them because their Chinese reading skill is limited. But I had no idea that I would be standing in front of the wall for so long - the menu is super extensive. The funny thing is when I mentioned that they have an \"egg\" section and a claypot section - my friends didn't even know! They have an interesting operation where customers order by the number on a slip of paper and then you pay for it at the counter. They charge 50 cents for clearing the table. And you grab all the utensils, bowls, tea, cups by yourself. We ordered the fried tofu, because that's one of the few dishes that my friends always get. However, I thought it was just okay. I prefer crispy fried tofu, not mushy fried tofu. We tried the salted fish with chicken claypot rice and that was pretty legit. The pork bun from the Taiwanese section was good too. They serve the buns and the meat separately so you make your own sandwich. The pork chop udon was a little disappointing, the pork chop looked super dry. They also have a dim sum section and we got the liquid-y yellow bun aka \"lau sa bao\" in Cantonese. That's a popular dim sum in Hong Kong and it's special because the steamed bun has liquidy yellow egg custard oozing out when you bite into it. However, the egg custard at this place wasn't too liquid-y so it was more like \"lai wong bao\". We got some simple green veggies to balance everything else out. My friends warned me to drink lots of water due to the amount of MSG in the food and boy, were they not kidding. It's still good though. It sure beats ordering from the English menu :)", 
      "This is the best Chinese food you will find in the Champaign/Urbana/Savoy/Mahomet area. They used to be on campus, them moved out to Mahomet, now back on campus (note that the restaurant has changed names with each move). My friends and I always joke that they would make bank if they moved up to the Chicago suburb area. But they do very well already right now where they are. My family has known their family for about 6 years now, and they are the sweetest people on earth. If you're not sure what to order, you can always ask them (Tina is very helpful) what they recommend. Our staple dishes here are:Steamed fish (i don't know the name, but it's some type of white fish steamed with green onions, ginger, sitting on top of bean sprouts. So fresh and delicious!)Crab Rangoon - never had betterOrange ChickenBasil Eggplantsoup of some kind, they're all pretty goodsmoked chicken Crispy Tofu!!! People try to copy their recipe, but the original is still, after all these years, unbeatable!Service in my opinion is always great. If you're going to gripe about cleaning your own table or writing down your order on a piece of paper (it just makes the ordering and cooking process faster - win for everyone), then don't eat here. More good food for the rest of us who don't need to be sucked up to and waited on for a good meal. This is your cozy mom and pop and daughter Chinese food shop. There's so much love in that food! :)", 
      "I've been coming here since it opened, and before that, I was driving to Mahomet to eat at the Wok. \u00a0So I am not unbiased.I love this place. \u00a0Over 1000 meal choices, and everything is translated into English from the old menu. \u00a0There are your normal \"Americanized Chinese\" meals like sweet and sour pork, and beef and broccoli. \u00a0I assume they're pretty good, but I'm more excited about the more exotic meals.I've had three cup chicken, stewed goat (with skin), eggplant and garlic, yellow bean fish, crispy tofu, Peking (or Fire) duck, peppered beef, squid with garlic sauce here, and salt and pepper squid. \u00a0I also had the soft pork buns, though those may have another name now. \u00a0There are so many more options, I've hardly scratched the surface. \u00a0The Peking duck in particular is amazing - fried to crispy, crackly perfection and served with a thick dipping sauce. \u00a0It's just awesome. The crispy tofu is also excellent, and is served with a sweet sauce and cilantro leaves. \u00a0I'd say it is the best in town. \u00a0The yellow bean fish is pretty consistently good, as well. \u00a0The food has always been good. \u00a0The prices are higher than what you see at a lot of Chinese places, but you get a lot of food and it is very good quality. \u00a0You get a big bowl of rice to eat with your food, too. \u00a0Generally, my girlfriend and I get a couple meals out of a visit here, where we get two entrees and usually pay about $30. \u00a0The dining room definitely does fill up, especially during the school year. \u00a0I'd give yourself some extra time to eat here, especially at dinner.I guess the ordering system confused some people to start with, but I don't mind it. \u00a0They recently streamlined it, too, along with improving the previously kind of Spartan decor. \u00a0You just write down the number of people in your party and what meals you want, pay, \u00a0and then they bring it to you. \u00a0Simple and easy. \u00a0You do have to clean up your own dishes (unless you want to pay a little extra) but they don't take tips, so it kind of balances out.This place has pretty much become my first stop for a Chinese-type food craving. \u00a0They're friendly, the options are immense, and the food is very good. \u00a0I was able to take my sister's vegetarian boyfriend here no problem, and the large sizes mean you can feed more people more affordably than if you're just going by yourself or with a date.Highly recommended!", 
      "The ordering process is just ridiculous. \u00a0I enjoyed the food when they were Mandarin Wok, so we tried to eat at Golden Harbour. \u00a0The menu was SO EXTENSIVE as to be completely intelligible (with little to no description of each dish) and the ordering was so completely annoying for a party of two that just wanted to order two small entree-sized portions (VERY RARE thing here) that we left without ordering. \u00a0There are a lot of options for Chinese food in this town, ones with a MUCH better dining experience.I have however had a few take-out dishes from Golden Harbor that someone brought to a gathering and they consisted of relatively the same brown sauce with different vegetables, some with mushrooms, some with squash, some with greens. \u00a0Rather ordinary, nothing terribly special.", 
      "The food here is spot on authentic. It has been busy everytime I have been here, adn everythign I have tried has been delicious!", 
      "My friend was the only non-Chinese person here! \u00a0It must be good! \u00a0:) \u00a0We just ordered using pictures of dishes from Yelp. \u00a0They figured out what the dishes were. \u00a0The soup and fried rice were great, but I don't know what they are called!", 
      "I felt it was time to update my review since they changed a lot since my last review. \u00a0Don't worry though, everything they did was for the better, and the place is still as good as ever. \u00a0I will note the things that have changed though. \u00a0They have new menus now, since the old ones were all scribbled on, torn, falling apart. \u00a0The Mandarin menu is still up on the wall, but they now have a beautifully done full menu in English (feels like a textbook almost!) that contains all the dishes in English. \u00a0My favorite though is that they also now offer a smaller, \"Americanized\" menu, with the stuff Non-Asian ethnicities are likely to expect at a restuarant. \u00a0Even this though is still 100s of choices. \u00a0Second, you now have to pay a table cleaning fee. \u00a0Before, you were expected to clear your table (just remove all dishes and trash to bins located all around the restaurant) but I guess too many people were just leaving their dishes and no tips either. \u00a0Hell, I often would leave tips even when we cleaned off our tables because the staff is always so nice. \u00a0But yea, it's like 50 cents I think per person, and they now clean your table off at the end, so it's actually very reasonable. \u00a0Still no tips expected, you just pay the fee on your bill. \u00a0 We still clean our table off for courtesy, but you don't have to. \u00a0You also get your table number after your order now. \u00a0Also, lot's of people will stand up front and look through their menus, but we always just take them back to our table first and look while also grabbing a table we want. \u00a0:D \u00a0All and all, the food is still amazing, and I've never had a bad dish here. \u00a0I'm definitely starting to get to the point though where I have found so many excellent choices that are so superbly good, I just stick to them. \u00a0As always, the staff is super friendly and courteous too. \u00a0The front counter lady, I believe her name is Tina, is one of the nicest people I know. \u00a0Seriously, she puts a smile on my face, and I just want to give her a big hug. \u00a0She treats everyone like family, and it makes me so happy to know there are people still like that out in the world when there is also so much bad going on.All and all, this place is still top notch, and do yourself a favor and check it out if you haven't already. Pro Tip: \u00a0Go with a large party and share your platters. \u00a0Even the small size meals are enough to feed two people heartily. \u00a0It's a ton of fun though to just have everyone order different stuff, and pick a little bit of everything!", 
      "The food quality has definitely gone downhill since my last review. \u00a0Our most recent meal was definitely just mediocre. \u00a0Even some old standbys were disappointing like the braised pork belly buns - the pork belly looked like it was scraped off the bottom of the pot. \u00a0The clams in black bean sauce were just bad - sandy, tasteless, dry. \u00a0The fried rice noodles with beef were devoid of flavor - how does that happen?", 
      "Overall it is a nice place to enjoy various Chinese food from Taiwan to Sichuan. But i think the most dishes are too salty.", 
      "I must preface this review by saying that for about 364 days per year, I have no desire to eat Chinese food. For about 90% of those 364 days, I would say I actively dislike Chinese. For one magical day, however, I must get my Chinese fix.Today was that day. A friend recommended Golden Harbor as the place to go and thus we went. Honestly, it's not your traditional Chinese restaurant. In fact, I would call it a cafeteria where they bring your food to you. You don't really see a server except when the food comes. You clear your own table or you pay them to do it. It's kind of absurd how it's all organized.At the same time, it's Chinese food I would eat more than once a year. I actually liked it and since Golden Harbor didn't really score any points for ambiance or any of that cute stuff, it's four stars on the basis of food alone. In addition, when the rice cooker crapped out, the manager apologized for the inconvenience and hooked us up with lo mein instead. It's a little more expensive and a little more complicated to order but I would say the food is more than worth it.", 
      "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!This is one of the most authentic Chinese restaurants I have ever been to in the United States. They have 3 versions of menus here: an American menu, a translated authentic Chinese menu, and a menu in full Chinese written on the wall. Though I could be wrong, I could not find all the items listed in Chinese on the wall in the translated Chinese menu. Your best bet is to bring someone with you who reads characters if you are looking to get the full experience. I got the following:sesame balls: These were not as large as I hoped though they arrived at my table hot and crunchy and the red bean paste oozed out in exactly the way I hoped.Crispy tofu: these are large chunks of soft tofu which have been breaded and friend with a slightly sweet sauce on top. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Very nice.Spicy basil chicken: this seems to me a variant of orange chicken in that it is similarly fried and smothered in sticky sauce. A little too American for my taste though it seemed to have great reviews here on Yelp.The best thing I ate: a whole spicy fish. This was one of the items that I couldn't find in the translated menu but was on the wall. I think it was number 2099 though a double check with the cashier wouldn't hurt. This fish was deep fried and covered in a spicy soy sauce based sauce that included hot chilis. The frying left the small bones of the fish completely edible and slightly crunchy and paired with the tenderness of the fish meat in the middle....*drrroooollllllsssssssss*Finally, most things are DIY such as ordering at the cashier and grabbing your own chopsticks and napkins as well as filling up your own tea kettle. The busboys are ever-present and eager to help should you have any misshap you can't handle (my brother spilled a cup of water and they cleaned that up like lightening). \u00a0And just like in China, tip is not expected here. They just charge $0.50/person to clean the tables.I am ecstatic that I ate here and cannot wait to come back again!", 
      "Easily the best Chinese restaurant in central Illinois.Food here is beyond phenomenal. Most dishes are as authentic as it gets outside China itself, and even American favorites like sesame chicken taste quasi-genuine, rich in the flavor of natural chicken, not of heavy artificial sauces.Golden Harbor has no waiter service, and the decor is rather nondescript, but I think that's a plus as it contributes to the hole-in-the-wall, local, traditional feel of the restaurant which, since its days as the Wok in Mahomet, has actually received many technological upgrades.", 
      "Another proof of what people who live here will put up with. I walked in the door for dinner on a wintry evening and due to a serious ventilation problem found myself enveloped by invisible choking fumes. The fumes were from cooking peppers, I'm guessing? They didn't smell so much as they burned and choked. Some sort of fan in the kitchen must have been broken -- seriously, it was comical. I am not reporting an individual sensitivity of mine. \u00a0A very large party arrived just after we did and so I got to watch about fifteen people walk in the front door and then sequentially have the same reaction: walk in from the cold, take a deep breath, and start coughing.We all went along, I'm not sure why. \u00a0The restaurant was about one third full and all of the patrons sat there, tears in our eyes, each eating a few bites and then experiencing a racking cough. \u00a0We went through the bizarre ordering process and obeyed the greasy cardboard hand-lettered signs. So many of the other reviews rave about the food but mine was extremely oversalted. \u00a0Oversalted, after all this?Even if it had been Michelin three star food, you've got to have air. \u00a0My advice: Focus on the basics.", 
      "So excited to find a place with Taiwanese food! Went here for lunch with my coworker and it's a really casual, help yourself, kind of place. You walk in, get stunned by the wall of menu items, figure out what you want and write down an order. Go to the counter and pay (cash is 5% off!), then find a seat and wait for your food! The tofu is what they're famous for, so we ordered the Crispy Tofu. I wanted to get the Stinky Tofu but had to get back to work and didn't want to stink up the office. The prices are not cheap because they are big portions. So be prepared or bring people to share it all with!Pros: yummy foodCons: limited service", 
      "This is the best tasting chinese food I've had here. \u00a0Lai Lai is still on the list to try, and Cravings is one of my favorites.This brings me back to the good ole days when they ran Mandarin Wok. \u00a0Self-service so it operates a little differently than what most people are used to.Food was top notch, served family style, and reasonably priced.", 
      "Good food and friendly service. They treat you like family. Best Taiwanese / Chinese food in town. Make sure you order from the wall!", 
      "This is the best place you can go in the Champaign area for Chinese food. Make sure you go with a big group so that you can all share food around the lazy susan. The prices aren't cheap, but it's completely worth it.Drink lots of tea so that you can eat more and don't be hesitant to try food off the authentic Chinese menu. We tried the stinky tofu just because there was a disclaimer about how badly it smelled and how no refunds were allowed. It wasn't quite worth it, but it was fun.The duck tongue and frog legs were great and the pork belly pancakes- if you want to try weird foods.", 
      "Very good Taiwan style Chinese restaurant. Taiwanese I have met tell me they barely get better at home. Do I really need to continue writing?", 
      "Well, since my last review was flagged, I'll have to start this one again. (Previous post was to confirm the restaurant is indeed Tina's which was in question before she actually opened.)Tina's new place is at the site of the old Pickles restaurant on Green St. \u00a0She thankfully gutted most of the restaurant (needed it ages ago) and it is now very open. \u00a0There are numerous tables for Chinese Family-Style eating (lazy-susan in the middle of the table for food) along with standard tables (4-seaters). \u00a0So, this is a larger restaurant by Tina's standards (larger than Mandarin Wok's total seating). \u00a0She has Tea-Pots for tables now and a large tea making machine. \u00a0A great addition to the restaurant. \u00a0There's now enough space for the chinese menu out front and also the buffet table (only used during moon festival I think).Unfortunately I removed one star from the 5 for two things which together I felt were slightly important to new visitors...(- half-star) The new system of computer ordering from front to back of house is a bit frustrating for old customers of the Woks. \u00a0You are presented with a pad of paper and a pen and instructed to place your table number and number of party on the pad. \u00a0You then write down the numbers of items you wish to order. \u00a0When you get to the front all of this goes into the computer and zipped back to the cooks by electrical magic. \u00a0This is significantly faster than the older method of ordering, but much less personable. \u00a0One of the golden linings of Tina's restaurants is actually Tina herself- she knows her menu and she wields it well. \u00a0So, if you aren't sure what to order, you're in a bit of a bind with the new system. \u00a0Now, this was the first week, so it all might calm down in a week or two. \u00a0Incidentally some of the items on the menu are actually mistranslated.The items we had (and love) are:#204 - Spicy Basil Chicken \u00a0(mislabeled on the menu)#851 - Garlic Stir Fried Green BeansThe final half-star off is for a slight difference in flavor in the #204- I don't know what it is, hard to put my finger on it- I think it's due to new equipment, but it's ever so slightly different (at least when I had it).I'm definitely tempted to to give Tina 5 stars, as I can't express how happy I am I can eat her food again, but I feel for those who are going to go to her new place for the first time, those two aspects may make a difference.I hope to be back with more numbers to add to the list of dishes we really love. \u00a0I'll reconsider the last star as we go more often. \u00a0I suspect the first week will always be a bit rough around the edges.Definitely a place to recommend to everyone interested in Taiwanese food.[Addendum- we came for dinner the night before, but had to leave as there were no tables to be had and a 1 hour wait for food. \u00a0We came back the next day for lunch, and it was much better.]", 
      "Wow. The best Chinese in CU, for sure. Order something from the Chinese menu (American/Chinese menus are labeled as such). My family and I ordered the crispy basil chicken, crispy tofu, spicy whole fish, and the sesame balls. Ordering is done by writing the numbers of the dishes you want onto an order pad and taking it up to the register. The food is delivered to you at your table (quite quickly too). Ice water and hot tea is free and self serve. Bowls of rice are free as well.The crispy basil chicken was okay, nothing particularly special. The crispy tofu did not arrive as hot and crispy as I had anticipated, but it was still tasty. The spicy whole fish is where it's at (no. 2099). Very flavorful and crispy to the point that some of the smaller bones are easy to chew up and eat (REALLY TASTY). The whole family kept going for the fish, and it was the first thing to go. Sesame balls were good too.The staff are very kind and helpful, it was a pleasure to interact with them. There is no typical tip, but instead, you pay a 50 cent per person clean up fee. Takeout boxes are free, unless you want eco-friendly containers (the free ones are Styrofoam). Would absolutely return again for another meal!", 
      "Love it! I love the Basil Chicken!", 
      "First, I feel that I should set expectations: You won't have a waiter to help guide you through the menus. \u00a0You choose from either the abbreviated American menu, or go through the full \"Translated Menu\" and write your own guest check and give it to the cashier, pay, then take a number to your table to receive your food. \u00a0I actually love this idea as I, a waiter, have always felt conflicted as how to tip in most Chinese restaurants where you terrible service, but a server does come to your table and bring you your stuff so you feel compelled to leave something. . . . Golden Harbor even has signs saying tips aren't required and instead charge a $.50 per person clean up fee. \u00a0I also like how they give a five percent discount if you pay cash and the cashier was completely fluent in English and was far friendlier than any other Cashier/waitress I've experienced at a Chinese restaurant in town.The food was on par with what I've had at Lao Sze Schuan in Chicago's Chinatown, and far superior to any Chinese place I've found in town where every dish was basically - meat, veg, rice, generic greasy sauce,/no flavor.\" This is definitely a place for someone who appreciates good Chinese food, but isn't necessarily concerned with the ambiance or service.", 
      "I had a great experience at Golden Harbor. I would recommend going with a group of people because the entrees are rather large. We ordered 6 entrees for 8 people, but I think we could have finished a 7th entree if we had it.My favorite things that we ordered were the fried basil chicken, the crispy tofu, and the pork buns. The basil chicken was nicely spicy and the texture of the breaded meat was wonderful. The crispy tofu was in a sweet sort of sauce that I really enjoyed. We assembled the pork buns ourselves because they were served as a plate of meat, a container of buns, and a plate of garnishes (crushed peanuts, some sort of veggies, and cilantro). The menu is very extensive, so be prepared to spend some time looking through it (though you really can't go wrong with the basil chicken or crispy tofu!) When you arrive at the restaurant, you take a table number, menu, and ordering slip to a table of your choice. Then after you decide what you want, you bring your order slip up to the counter and pay. It works best for a group if everyone brings cash to split the cost because I'm not sure that they allow separate checks from one table. Then someone will bring your food to your table. Tea is free, and you can simply serve yourself. At the end of your meal you clear your own dishes, or else pay a few dollars to have them bus your table for you.", 
      "I love, love, love Golden Harbor. So delicious and definitely AUTHENTIC Chinese and Taiwanese food! It is not unusual for there to be a wait so call in advance if you are traveling with a large party. The menu might be a bit hard to navigate so if you have someone in your group who can read/speak Chinese, that will help make the experience much easier. Regardless, the management is really nice and they have been always happy to help customers with the menu, or make suggestions.The crispy tofu.... ah, so good... and the soft-shell crab in garlic sauce... yum... and the lion's head (not actual lion heads, but three giant meatballs)... so juicy and flavorful... actually, everything that I have had there has been absolutely delicious and I am convinced it is the best Chinese restaurant in the area. Go with a large group of friends so you can order a bunch of dishes and share family-style. When my family visited campus for graduation, they definitely approved! What is especially refreshing is that in spite of the boast-worthy food, neither the food nor the service is pretentious in the least bit. Golden Harbor, thanks for the delicious food, good service, and great times.", 
      "Amazing! As a vegetarian, I was extremely pleased with all the options!! They are all delicious! Everything I've ever gotten here has been amazing! I strongly recommend this place for chinese food at a fair price!", 
      "I ordered a soup for takeout.The problem is that they either tried to stuff too much soup in the container or they put it in when it was still too hot, as when I got home a short while later, the container's lid was all popped up and deformed and half of my soup was in the bag. :/ And no, I wasn't jumping up and down with it. However, (what was left of) my soup was super tasty."

      "Best Chinese food in driving range of UIUC! Believe the reviews about the crispy tofu; it's really that good. I've been here maybe 10 times and have never been disappointed. The optimal way to eat here is with a group of 4 or more people so you can share many different dishes! I haven't had any bad dishes, but some that were particularly good are: Crispy tofu (of course), Basil fried chicken, Taiwanese fried chicken, and salt and pepper fish.If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, expect a very long waiting time if you go any time after 6pm. It might be difficult to find a table, especially if there are 4+ people in your party. If you plan to go during that time, make a reservation!", 
      "True the ambience is not the best but that's not why you come here. The ordering system would be confusing if you didn't know about it in advance. But just like mandarin wok used to be this food is great! Recently they added a more Americanized menu attached to the main one and the only reason to order from that is they have the option of a smaller portion for less money. Maybe you could get that on the regular menu but it doesn't say and I didn't ask. They give you more rice than you probably need. If you are planning to save some leftovers you might not have any because it is hard to stop eating!", 
      "Saturday night - this place is hopping!It is a seat yourself restaurant - cafeteria feeling that has tables for 2-10 tops it seems. You grab a menu or look at the wall of dishes in Mandarin, write down what you want to eat by number on a server pad, and take it up to order/pay. There is a .50 cent charge per person for cleanup fee but no tip is necessary. They give you a number and eventually bring the food out to your table. There is self serve tea in the corner. There are a lot of options for food. We had 7 people - ordered 7 dishes: Sigua, On-Choy, lamb dish, beef+on choy, crispy tofu, fish filet, spicy beef+bamboo Everything came out hot and flavorful. Less salt would have made everything even better but overall chaotic / happy atmosphere. Prices are more than other chinese restaurants $10-15 per plate. Looking forward to trying other dishes in the future.", 
      "I read up on reviews of this restaurant before I went there as I was intimidated by their huge menu, unique ordering style, and my unfamiliarity with authentic chinese cuisine. I was determined to try a non-Americanized chinese dish, so I went through all of the pictures and descriptions on Yelp. I asked the person taking orders to explain the difference between a couple of dishes and make a recommendation. She was very patient and thorough, and her explanations were easy to understand and decipher. \u00a0Due to raving reviews I read about crispy tofu, that was what I went with. I got the dish to go- It was a Tuesday night and I waited about 15 minutes for the food to come out. I don't mind waiting- must really be cooked to order! My only regret is that I didn't get it to go. The tofu had been sitting in a puddle of sauce in a container (as opposed to a shallow pool of sauce on a plate) that it lost is crispyness. The sauce, which is rather sweet, was a little too sweet for me to enjoy it as a main dish. I would have loved to have gotten a smaller portion of it as an appetizer.All in all, I'm excited to go back to Champaign and try another dish next time.By the way, portions are HUGE. I mean, seriously huge. 1 order can easily feed two!", 
      "Golden Harbor is my go-to Chinese restaurant. The menu is huge, the restaurant is excellent for groups, and it's great that they offer private parking.My friends had to guide me through the ordering process where you look at the extensive menus on the wall (both in English and Chinese), fill out an order ticket and give to the cashier. Simple.My favorite dish - or at least the one I keep coming back for - is the crispy tofu. They make both a family and lunch special portion that are priced accordingly.Food is delivered to your table but you must bus your own dishes unless you want to pay extra. Hot tea is free.Warning, this restaurant is popular so if you plan to come with a group, try to come for an early dinner.", 
      "This place certainly feels quite authentic, especially given the (completely overwhelming) menu. I was only in a party of two, but this place is incredible for groups, with huge circular tables with a spinning platform in the middle - great for sharing dishes. I had a most delicious sesame chicken lunch special and a decent egg roll. No wait staff / no gratuity. (50 cent table clean up fee included on your order)", 
      "My dad's a first generation Chinese immigrant, and he drives here first whenever coming to campus. Seriously, it's that good. If you know Mandarin or have a Chinese friend, order off the secret menu. It will be worth it for sure. Standard dishes that people love include the Yu Xiang Egg Plant, giant ginger meat balls and crispy tofu. Amazing food for a decent price.", 
      "This place is THE PLACE to get authentic Chinese food in Champaign. Everything is great on the menu, you really can't go wrong. One of their signature dishes is the \"Crispy Tofu\". But really you can't go wrong with anything there unless you order something outside of your spiciness range.", 
      "Went with a large group for a birthday celebration, ended up ordering family style. \u00a0Everything was fantastic, especially the stick fried tofu and the pork buns. \u00a0Fantastic place to go with a large group, but just make sure to bring cash to split the bill.Overall, the best Chinese food I've had, bar none. \u00a0A bit on the expensive side, but well worth the cost.", 
      "I keep hearing how good this place is and I finally checked it out. I was not disappointed! I read a lot of reviews about the ordering process and how it was confusing. I think they must have heard because when we went it was really clear how to do it and I found it very easy. They have a big sign with instructions and instructions inside the menus, also. To be clear, you go in the door, there are menus, the American and the translated. You take an order pad and a pen, write down the number of what you want, take it to the counter and pay. They give you a number then bring the food to your table. After you pay, there is a table with flatware for you to grab. They bring your plates, napkins, and chopsticks to the table for you. Simple and easy!The translated menu has SO many choices! I didn't know what to order so I went with the standard General's chicken and my hubby got the Schezwan chicken. We split the pork filled pot stickers. Everything was amazing, just amazing. Best Chinese food I have ever had.I think next time we go, I'd like to have my Chinese friend order for us. I think that'd be a lot more fun and I'd get to try more authentic foods since everyone has been raving about them. I think he'd choose a lot of different and tasty stuff besides the Americanized dishes. We got there a bit after 5. Around 5:30 it was like the flood gates opened at it was PACKED (it was a Saturday). There are a lot of tables. It's good for groups too because they have a lot of big round tables with the lazy Susan in the middle for sharing and passing different dishes. I can't wait to go again, at least I have plenty of leftovers to last a while! The portions are generous! Top notch!", 
      "How would I know there was a yummy authentic Chinese restaurant in Champaign? Thanks Yelp! Loved this place. The food was delicious and almost every table had the giant lazy susan in the middle for sharing. We had a large crowd and ordered veggie dishes, orange chicken, sesame chicken, and spicy shrimp. Everybody loved it and the prices were reasonable especially for a large group.", 
      "Absolutely delicious food. Actually *authentic* Chinese food. I love their steamed Chinese broccoli. My favorite dish is their Crispy Tofu with green onion in a sweet chilli sauce.Note about venue: Golden Harbor is not the right place to go if you're wanting a classy and quiet atmosphere (for a dinner date, business lunch, ect). The dining section is dirty, the furniture is cheap, the lighting is not flattering, and it gets pretty loud during rush hours.", 
      "For a place that looks like a Greyhound bus station, it's pretty good!Not going to lie, it's not fancy looking by any means, and they seriously need new menus. I had to sift through 5 menus to find out that it was one big menu, just torn apart. AND THE EFFING WATER!!! I know it's free but it seriously takes forever for the water to come out of the fountain dispenser. I wanted to get Sprite not because I really wanted it but because I knew I would've gotten it quicker. But hey...I like free stuff including free water.However, the cashier was super friendly and knowledgeable-- she recc'd the fried tofu which was AMAZING! There's a reason why everyone raves about it. I got fried rice which was simply delish-- it had the right amount of rice and meats--- the soy sauce was nicely balanced. For a large plate, it was worth 10.99!This place is pretty legit!", 
      "I've had friends that raved about the Wok, so I was anxious to try this place out. \u00a0In my opinion, the food was quite good, everything else was pretty mediocre.The most confusing part about this place is the order process. \u00a0When you come in, there are a couple different menus, then you also have to pick up a table number, and a clipboard with an order sheet. \u00a0You then write down your order, and give it to the people working the counter. \u00a0This may be a function of the place being new, but none of the customers knew how to do this, and the two staff at the counter didn't seem up to speed either. \u00a0I really hope they drop the stupid order process. \u00a0I suppose that works well for very large groups. \u00a0But for just 2 people, it is way more trouble than it is worth.The menu is quite large. \u00a0But when I finally found the vegetarian section, I was pretty satisfied with the offerings. \u00a0The prices are quite high to me , at least for a Champaign restaurant that is more like a cafeteria than a sit down place.Another issue I have is with table busing/cleaning. \u00a0They have a fee if you want them to clean your table, which most people don't pay. \u00a0So people do their own tables, leaving a LOT of very unclean tables. \u00a0And they don't provide napkins other than with the meal. \u00a0So when you sit down, you really have no way of wiping away residue left by others.When the food came, I was really quite pleased with the food. \u00a0VERY spicy, which I like. \u00a0So you may want to ask for less spicy if you are bad about that (although I don't know how you would do that with the bizarre order process.Anyway, I might be overly negative to a new place. \u00a0If they get some logistics worked out, I think this could be a good place. \u00a0I'll probably try again, but after several months.", 
      "We loved our meal. My mom is usually intimidated by places \u00a0like this but the server at the counter was so nice her anxiety was quickly settled and she volunteered to get our hot tea (free) and water. We got the crispy tofu (wonderful), a hot pot, and buns. All were yummy and so different. Portions are BIG. The hot pot is not what we thought (no crispy rice). We would come back in a second. My mom said, \" this is a place I will wish I could have when I am home.\" Also, I should add my father is a chef and we are fairly hard to please.", 
      "I took my parents. They both seemed to like it. My mother raved about her entr\u00e9e, which I believe was beef fried rice. She also enjoyed the fried pot-stickers, though they weren't all that thoroughly fried (obviously steamed and then quickly \"fried\" on one side). I wasn't too hungry and just had the crispy tofu, which was excellent as many others have said. Held up well the next day for lunch, too.We ordered a mix of things from the translated menu and the \"American\" menu. I didn't find the order process to be complex even as a first-timer. Grab a menu, find what you want, write it on a piece of paper, go up to the counter. Not rocket science. We grabbed a table first which made things a bit easier.", 
      "Best Chinese Restaurant around the Champaign-Urbana area. As a Chinese I am picky about the taste of dishes, and Golden Harbor just can satisfy our tongues and stomachs. If they can have better decorations it would be even greater.Recommendations: Taiwan Guai Bao, Fuzhu Niunan Bao, XO Baby Squids, etc. The fishes are also good. (Pity that I cannot type the Chinese names for these dishes, that would be of great help for Chinese gourmets like me!)", 
      "Seriously, best Taiwanese/Chinese food near U of I, try it for yourself but make sure you order the right dishes! The menu is extensive and often times overwhelming, but try to narrow it down to a few good dishes. Like most people, I recommend the Crispy Tofu, Peking Duck, and Three Cup Chicken.Don't go looking for typical Americanized Chinese dishes, you'll regret it because you have an opportunity to try real, delicious Chinese cuisine. Also, if you share a bunch of dishes amongst a group, your total won't come out to be unreasonable! It gets pretty busy on the weekends, but generally tables clear out pretty fast so don't be discouraged.Yum!", 
      "Very good Chinese food. \u00a0Incredible array of dishes to choose from. \u00a0I would recommend going with someone who knows what they're doing though because most of the items are in Chinese and the English language menu is far shorter. \u00a0Golden harbor loses a star because two of the six dishes we ordered were distinctly average (chicken w/ mushrooms and beef in sweet garlic). \u00a0Also, comments about them stuffing too much in each container are accurate, we had some spillage to deal with when we got home. \u00a0This is a welcome problem of course.", 
      "The food was good, and I loved the free hot tea. I liked the ordering system where you bring up your paper to the front to place your order. The woman at the front counter was very friendly, as another reviewer mentioned. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the place was kind of messy when I went in- lots of junk on the floor, didn't seem like it had been swept much that day. I do recommend trying this place at least once if you like Chinese.", 
      "This restaurant must be the paradise for Chineses living in Urbana. I've never seen this amount of items in a menu, ever. I got the cheese rangoons, which were delicious, and reminded me of Brazilian cheese \"pastel\". The golden mushrooms on tofu were a fun surprise, we thought they were noodles! My vegetable with sweet garlic sauce was very yummy. And cheap! Don't miss it!", 
      "I'm not exaggerating. This is the best Chinese restaurant in central, if not the entire state of Illinois. When you walk in all you see are Chinese people laughing and having a good time. The entire menu is in Chinese so you either have to remember the number or have a local that can read the menu here. I was skeptical at first when someone told me that this was the best Chinese food. After one bite of their crispy tofu, I shed a little tear of joy and just kept eating.", 
      "It took me a long time to get to Golden Harbor. I had heard SO many varying opinions, from the over-the-top fantastic to the somewhat mediocre. I had heard about the complicated ordering system and the offering of strange meat items (goat? some kind of squid?).Well, I finally went last Tuesday... and WOW. Here's a breakdown of the trip:My friend made reservations for our group of six. Our table was ready right on time, and while it wasn't super crowded, it seems that making a reservation for a group of more than four is a good idea. We picked up our menus and a pad of receipt paper, and a friend grabbed tea and cups for all. The tea was fantastic. The menu, bewildering - in the best way something can be bewildering.There are SO MANY OPTIONS, and so many of them sound AWESOME. We ended up with six dishes, to be shared family style. I chose a crispy eggplant and basil dish, and Mr. Husband got some crispy pork. We also had another eggplant dish (I want to cry just thinking about it! SO much scrumptious eggplant!), a black vinegar pork, some kind of weird crab thing (I don't like eating things that look like spiders, so I didn't eat that), and, uh, something else fried. Our food was served surprisingly quickly, considering we ordered six things. It only took 10-15 minutes as I recall. (The conversation was amusing, though, so it may have taken slightly longer.)The eggplant dishes were like riding a dragon while eating cotton candy made from angel tears (awesome). I loved loved loved the crispy fried eggplant! I surprised myself, too, in that my second-favorite dish was black vinegar pork. Mmm. I tried everything except the spiders, and I was in heaven. Prices were decent. Expect to pay around $10-15 per person. Considering that they charge a table-clearing fee and there's no expectation to leave a tip, that's pretty decent. Consider going elsewhere - you might only spend $6-8 per person on an entree, but then you add a drink, and have to tip 20% at the end. The total trip cost me $25 for 2 dishes, which I was pleased with.Bottom line, for the \"tl;dr\" crowd: Awesome food, not too expensive, go with a group, make a reservation, drink tea, don't eat spider-crabs.", 
      "\"Authentic Chinese food. Huge Selection.\"Golden Harbor is one of the most authentic Chinese restaurant in the area. I recommend #514 the Szechuan Water Fish Fillet, if you like spicy food. The Kung Pao Chicken, Kung Pao Shrimp and Garlic Shrimp are also good if you are not a huge fan of spicy food, but want some heat. The side of beef fried rice from the menu is huge and is not the same type of fried rice that comes with as a side dish of a meal. Order it if you like fried rice - this fried rice is of better quality.There is a huge Chinese menu on the wall, but have no fear, they now have a large translated Chinese menu and a Americanized Chinese menu, both in English. This is not a place to go to expect the fake Americanized Oriental Chinese atmosphere with Chinese music playing in the background, but is a restaurant that actually serves authentic Chinese food. Like most restaurants in China, it is order, pay, and be served with little interruption from the staff after the food in delivered. Do not a fancy Red Americanized Chinese atmosphere, and you will not be disappointed. As this is one of the most frequented local restaurants for international students from both China and Taiwan, if you like authentic Chinese food, you will not be disappointed.", 
      "The first thing that strikes many diners at Golden Harbor is the set of rules and practices which differ from American expectations. \u00a0There's a table set aside covered in menus and \"Guest Check\" books for you to fill out your own order form. \u00a0Then you queue up and wait to pay. \u00a0If you have questions you are asked not to delay the people behind you, to step out of the line. \u00a0Except that the line is never ending so you cannot get your question answered without stalling the line.Next, only credit cards and checks pay the full bill. \u00a0Cash payers get a 5% discount. No tipping is allowed or expected.And a new rule as of November 27, 2011, they add 50 cents person as a charge for cleaning the table, because the former practice of allowing people to clean up after themselves on busy nights (and avoid the fee) caused spilled sauces and sloppy floors.Strange, but explainable. \u00a0Lastly, a soft drink with unlimited refills costs $2.60, which might be the highest priced soda pop in Champaign County.", 
      "Wonderful food. Amazing flavor! So much fresh!!!", 
      "I don't like to write reviews, but have to recommend this place. The food here is awesome. Will definitely come back again.", 
      "I've eaten at Golden Harbor three times now, once for lunch and twice for dinner.I went to the restaurant once in Mahomet prior to the move and have not been disappointed by the food at the Champaign location.This is the sort of Chinese food that makes you want to eat Chinese every week. \u00a0Most of the dishes are in the $8-12 price range, but the portion sizes are generous and the ingredients top quality. \u00a0The ordering system (and menu size) can be a bit overwhelming - we've consulted with the cashier several times to get recommendations about specific dishes. \u00a0The wait time really varies but even when the restaurant is full, dishes tend to come out within 20-30 minutes.", 
      "I am not Chinese, but my boyfriend is, and he says this place is close to what his family makes, so I believe him :). That said, I've had a lot of great food here. Chen-do chili chicken, eggplant, beef ho fun, stir fried bok choy and a fried melon dish are a few of my favorites. At first it can be confusing to order, and I've seen a lot of people look overwhelmed by the menu and people milling about the counter. I say: DON'T WALK OUT! Ask the lady at the register (daughter of chef) and she can help you. Highly recommend.", 
      "Being Chinese myself, this restaurant is definitely in my must go list. They make some real wonderful Chinese food and the price is reasonable . Their tastes are favor southern part of China and I think the owner is Taiwanese, nonetheless, being this far from China and you can still have some nice local Chinese food just purely awesome.", 
      "I love the lunch portion here because it's not too big for me. \u00a0My favorite lunch specials are Crispy Tofu, and Broccoli Chicken. \u00a0As for dinner, I love Basil Chicken I wish it came in the lunch portion too. \u00a0The only concerns I have at this restaurant are that tables are often dirty and the restaurant setting doesn't creat a relaxing dinning ambiance. \u00a0Will definitely go back!", 
      "This place is amazing. \u00a0If you don't know what to order, ask the woman at the counter, she is super friendly and helpful. \u00a0Forget all the lower reviews that complaining about busing your own table, getting your own silverware, drinks, etc. \u00a0The food is amazing and authentic. \u00a0Don't order off the American Chinese menu! \u00a0Pick a meat/vegetable and a description that sounds good. \u00a0If you want to know the difference ask. \u00a0Come early or late for a better chance of a table. \u00a0Some of our favorites include: \u00a0Steam Pork Buns, Crispy Tofu(not good leftover), Spicy Eggplant, Salt and Pepper Anything(though ask for light on salt), \u00a0BBQ Duck or Spicy Duck, and their soups, one was a spicy pork with wide noodles, really good and huge.", 
      "Not sure what the rave these helpers are experiencing, but I had better Chinese food. I went out of my way to this restaurant traveling in between cities, and I was disappointed. The menu selection gave a feeling that it was authentic but it's ok. They did had good Chinese vegetables in my noodle dish, but the broth was watered down and the noodles seem under cooked. The person taking our orders behind the desk was not very friendly as well.", 
      "I have been to Golden Harbor a few times and done take out a few times. This place is great. I haven't had even a 1/4 of the dishes they offer but so far the ones that I have had have been excellent. Yes the Crispy Tofu is amazing. The crispy orange chicken and the orange beef were very tasty. I really enjoyed the Taiwanese Salt n Pepper Crispy Chicken. We had one of the Hot Pots but I don't remember which but I wish I did because it was really good. I also tried the Crispy Cuttlefish with salt yolk which I was very surprised by how good it was, I though it would be too salty but it was quite tasty. The service is always pleasant and now that they have their system down the wait time is very reasonable. Each dish is large so it is best to go with a lot of people and that way you can share many dishes. Looking forward to the next time I get to go.", 
      "I went here or the first time with my family to celebrate a birthday!! Let me tell you, walking in my whole family were like 'what the ffff...\" The inside's atmosphere was nuts! Long line, some gave not learned, and no waiter insight! We then found out that you have to go in lie order food which is unorthodox! My family decided to find a table d leave it up to me \u00a0to order. I ordered: crispy basil eggplant (amazing!!) perfect tempura texture coated with basil sauce! It was perfectly balanced and the cripyess of the eggplant made the dish! beef brisket and tendon mala pot (TO DIE FOR) - oh my gosh!!! Holy tendon!! The brisket and tendon absolutely \u00a0melts in your mouth! My aunt kept talking about how wonderful this dish was! Clams w/ black bean sauce - meh. Nothing special.. Get something different. pork belly with bokchoy( great but reminds me too much of Paksiw which is a Filipino dish) the pok belly was very soft ad tasty! Whole fish #500 - SO EFFING goooooooddd!!! The fish was well seasoned and tasty! The fillet melts in your mouth! Yum! I am vey happy with this experience! The only reason I'm giving it a four is because of the organization of the place. Truly go here if you want AUTHENTIC Chinese food!! Can't wait to come back!,Btw the pace is BYOB!", 
      "authentic good Chinese food in the Midwest. You don't come here for the service or the ambiance. You come here for the food, and the food here is REALLY good!", 
      "Between here and Lai Lai, Champaign has some very good Chinese choices on campus. Not to say that the other local choices aren't good as well but these two restaurants serve some of the more classy authentic Chinese dishes that you wouldn't expect other restaurants to serve. Fortunately for the students, these restaurants cook well enough that there is no immediate need to run to Chinatown to enjoy good Chinese cooking. Don't miss the tea smoked chicken here. Although it's not as friendly to non-Chinese and usually very busy, don't let that deter you from visiting this gem.", 
      "I can only comment on the vegetarian food. From other people in my party though they seemed to really enjoy the meat dishes. I found the food to be the best chinese food in this area. They cooked the eggplant perfectly. Most places I find it's either to chewy or too dry. They got it dead on. The cripsy tofu is delicious. I recommend ordering 2 dinner dishes for 3 people. That will be more than enough food. When eating here for dinner be sure to allow for 45 minutes for your food to come. Though, I went with a group for lunch and went at the beginning of the lunch hour and our food arrived within 20 minutes. Anyways I highly recommend this place.", 
      "Tasty and authentic.", 
      "Food is really good! \u00a0The ordering process is a bit complicated at first but you get used to it. \u00a0You don't have to pay for tip which is a big plus for a college student. \u00a0Portions are fair and the food is excellent quality! \u00a0The fried tofu is really good!"

      "I Loooove this place! \u00a0Living in this town my entire life I always like to discover new places but most leave me with a \"meh\" attitude after. \u00a0When This place first opened I was intrigued to try it. \u00a0I had not been to their place in Mahomet but my mother always raved about their food.When you first walk into GH you find a table with pens order tablets and menus, both an American menu and more authentic menu with a billion items on it! (Well.. not a billion but I still take 20 minutes to decide what I want to this day...and I've been to GH my fair share of times, and then some) \u00a0For some reason there are a lot of people that don't care for this way of running things and I have watched people literally walk in.. look around, you see it click in their head how things work as they read the signs, and walk out. WTH?! \u00a0It's not rocket science and its really a relief to have a place to go that isn't a cookie cutter restaurant like a lot of the chain garbage around here. \u00a0The lady behind the counter is super friendly and will help you through the process if you're confused. \u00a0She also will recommend something for you to try if you tell her what you're in the mood for. \u00a0If you want something done a little differently, no problem. \u00a0VERY accommodating!Anyway, you figure out what you want and write it on the pad and pay. \u00a0They give you a number and you find a table. \u00a0Hot tea and water are available to go grab while you wait (or soda for purchase) \u00a0AND this place is also a BYOB! awesome. \u00a0Depending on how busy they are they can take 10 minutes and some nights where its busy I've waited ~30 to get all our food.. which in comparison to other businesses on a busy night, is nothing. \u00a0Also sometimes the food comes out in strange orders (main dish before soup or apps) \u00a0but that also is no big deal, I would rather my food be fresh and hot (which it always is here) then have it come out cold due to course etiquette.Now for the food. \u00a0Everyone says the crispy tofu is amazing, which it is. \u00a0But since that is a given I won't go into that. \u00a0My husband and I have tried to switch things up every time we go, but over time we've found some go-to dishes. \u00a0I really enjoy all the \"crispy\" dishes, the basil chicken is almost a candied texture and soooo yum! And they are super generous on the basil! Enough for every bite! There's also one in sweet chili sauce that I remember enjoying. \u00a0Also a sweet chili crispy pork (I'm drooling now). \u00a0The crispy beef with black bean is nothing like one of those cheap chain beef and black beans. \u00a0Its huge chunks of meat that are cooked until just perfectly done and have the best meaty taste unlike allot of places where you question what the meat is you are actually eating and what they've done to it to make it the disgusting flavorless texture it is. \u00a0This stuff is a great combination of flavor and they don't use the sauce to mask the meat. \u00a0We also enjoy the \"salt and pepper\" items, The salt and pepper squid is great, simple and done perfectly(there is no sauce) though I would ask them to go light on the salt as it is sometimes a little overpowering (but I love salt) The one thing my husband always goes back to is the crispy shredded pork in hot oil sauce, and I've got to say, it's pretty darn amazing as well. (am I getting repetitive yet with the \"amazing/awesome\" comments, at least you're getting my point this place is friggen great!) \u00a0So this pork is little crispy golden tidbits with lots of cilantro and hot peppers and its coated in this indescribable sauce, I'm sure it's simple.. but simple is good! \u00a0And this is one thing you have to try! \u00a0Never disappoints! \u00a0My 3 year old daughter likes the egg drop soup and the vegetarian egg rolls, which I've tried nibbles of and also find enjoyable. \u00a0The soup is thick and filling and not neon orangey yellow, you know its homemade. \u00a0The veggie rolls are crisp and light. \u00a0Even the rice is delightful! \u00a0You can have fried or white (we tend to ask for both) \u00a0And if you need more, just bring up your bowl and they will give you more!I could go on forever about this place, you can't go wrong, be adventurous! \u00a0Close your eyes and run your finger down the menu, where ever you stop, you'll love it!", 
      "GIGANTIC menu! Everything I have tried here was tasty. A great place to go in a group, order a few dishes and share. We have had several parties here and everybody has loved it.It is also BYOB, another plus for parties.", 
      "The food is delicious, by far the best Chinese food in central illinois. I have been twice - once for takeout and once seated. I always go with my Chinese friends - they are never hard to convince because the food is so good.There are a number of dishes that I love, but I don't really know the names - I have them written down in Chinese - but more often than not I just ask my friends to pick something. I've never been let down.The employees at the register are also very helpful in finding something to suit your palette. (There's never a shortage of spicy food at my table). \u00a0The full menu is available as an English menu as well.The staff also provides a \"free\" item as well. If you order 4 entrees, you will get 5 dishes (maybe an appetizer, maybe an entree).Keep in mind - you go here for the food. The atmosphere is simple. Large room, lots of tables. But you just cant beat the food at any other Chinese restaurant in the area. The chef and owner has a tradition of establishing excellent restaurants in the area. They previously ran Mandarin Wok, later started the Wok in Mahomet, and are now moving back to Champaign.", 
      "This place is amazing! \u00a0They have a chinese menu on the wall, and an english version book menu! \u00a0I mean BOOK! \u00a0its so extensive i didn't think there was anyway \u00a0that much food could be in one place! \u00a0lol \u00a0I cant remember what i ordered, but it was really good, chicken with chiles maybe? There doesn't seem to be anything sweet on the menu :-( \u00a0Its pricey, but a total experience worth having! \u00a0I thought i was back in China town in NYC! \u00a0Loved it, you gotta go, but be prepared to spend 30 mins looking at the menu before you get in line to order your food. \u00a0Get your own beverage passed the cashier, and find a seat. \u00a0They have Extra large tables like in real chinese restaurants, with a lazy susan in the middle to share. \u00a0Sharing is the cornerstone of chinese eating, love that!", 
      "Best Chinese food in the C-U. A bit of an unorthodox approach, you go there, fill out your menu ticket, go up and pay (5% discount for cash) and your food is brought to your table. The menu is HUGE! I recommend spicy chicken, though I don't know their exact title for it and the crispy tofu. The place is usually crowded, especially on weekends.Also, although they don't advertise it, it is BYOB.", 
      "We get the hot and sour soup Taiwanese style no meat, crispy tofu (sauce on the side), and some greens. For dessert we get the sesame balls. \u00a0Great food.", 
      "So good. Can be pricey but a great place to eat family style. You must try it at least once!", 
      "Yelp \u00a0must be broken - this was barely edible. I can't possibly understand how the average ranking is so high for this place. \u00a0Honesly, I over-ordered so that I could get a sampling of a few different things. \u00a0Even with that shotgun approach I could not find any of the four dishes that was worth eating even half the portion. Is this really the best Chinese food in town?? \u00a0It definitely feels like you are in a restaurant in China when you are at a table but.... not when it comes to the food.", 
      "I was a fan of Golden Harbor when it was in Mahomet. I am glad that they moved to Champaign and with so many more tables. My favorite menu is crispy tofu, basil chicken, and wu lur fish. The food here is more toward the greasy side and kinda pricey, but if I look for chinese food, it's definitely Golden Harbor.", 
      "Yes, the ordering process was horrible. The restaurant seemed understaffed, and I couldn't believe that awkward sign detailing all the fees if you want them to clear your table. \u00a0However! It was all worth it for the crispy tofu, topped with that amazing sweet sauce. I'm a huge tofu fan and it was definitely some of the best I've had. Will be back the next time I'm in the area.", 
      "so underrated...but BEST.TOFU.ever. crispy or bbq tofu... get get get someeee", 
      "Best Taiwanese restaurant so far since I came to the states!!!!!!!!!!", 
      "Their General Tso's Crispy Chicken is normally served without vegetables. \u00a0I asked them to throw in some water chestnuts and, served over fried rice, the result was wonderful, amazing, epic...what can I say? \u00a0I live in the Chicagoland area, and this was one of the best Chinese dishes i've ever had, period. \u00a0Now that my daughter has enrolled at U. of I., many return visits will be made. \u00a0I'm already plotting the next one.", 
      "Probably (definitely) my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. It has more traditional authentic Chinese dishes but also Americanized dishes if that's your preference. My favorites are the Singapore rice, fried tofu and basil eggplant. And the Kung Pao chicken is great also.", 
      "Yes, the incredible number of choices can be daunting- but oh the fun you will have trying things out! \u00a0Food comes out straight from the stove (be careful with that first bite) and is well worth the wait.One of the reviewers mentioned a review in the Champaign Taste blog that might give you ideas of what to order. Another blogger has been posting pictures and descriptions at goldenharborchineseresta\u2026. I was inspired by one the pictures to order #896 (Snow pea leaves with King Mushrooms) - which included the greens and two kinds of thinly sliced mushrooms in a savory brown sauce (with lots of whole garlic cloves). Wow. In Hawaii, we would say \"broke da mouth\"!A warning - we arrived at 5:30 PM on a Saturday, and a lot of the tables were already reserved (which meant not a lot of tables left for walk-ins). If you have a party of more than 2-4 you might want to call ahead on a weekend. \u00a0Even if you have to wait, it will be well worth it!", 
      "Not very fond of this place. I think Lai-Lai does a much better job with lower prices. I went with a Taiwanese friend on a Sunday afternoon. It was very crowded, noisy, with a confusing ordering process. It felt like a high school cafeteria with Chinese food that cost a lot. The dishes we ordered weren't very good. I had my Taiwanese friend make the choices and he didn't think much of what was served. All in all, a disappointing experience. There are lots of Chinese restaurants in C-U and some of them are good! Try them...", 
      "This is the only place in town that I know of where you can order goat with the skin on and goat intestines. Other reviewers have commented on the lack of oxygen in the place; I'm not sure that matters all that much. If you're looking for goat, this is definitely the place to go!", 
      "The BEST Chinese food I have had in the United States in a long time. I love Asian food, but typically avoid Chinese restaurants due to the typical tired, Americanized fare. The flavors at Golden Harbor are very authentic, just like dishes I had in Taiwan and China (Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou and Beijing) in spring 2011. I'm already trying to think of an excuse to return to Champaign. Try the crispy tofu, eggplant with garlic sauce, and spicy fried green beans.", 
      "It is not one of the best Chinese \u00a0restaurant in Champaign, it is the best.", 
      "All of my Chinese friends rave about this place. I went here and while the price is a little more than your average Chinese restaurant on campus, the food is top notch. The best tasting Chinese food on campus bar none. The portions are huge too.", 
      "Everyone needs to eat here once if you like chinese food. This place is so amazing it will make you hate all the cheep dives in town (Hot Wok, No.1 Wok, etc). Number 305 (crispy shreaded pork) is a family favorite along with the Crispy Tofu, Fried Basil Chicken.", 
      "My favorite restaurant EVER!!get 511! and CRISPY TOFU! you will not regret itit's better if you go with a lot of people and reserve a table with the spinny thing in the middle cuz it gets kinda packed during dinner time.If u go with a pretty big group and do family style, you'll guarantee try some good dishes. Their sizes are very generous as well.make sure you tip them if u dont' want to clean up the tables!", 
      "This is, hands down, the best chinese food in central Illinois. \u00a0Another reviewer put it very succinctly, though: \u00a0you go for the food and not the atmosphere. \u00a0If you want to be pampered, go somewhere else. \u00a0If you want tasty & authentic chinese, eat here! \u00a0Other reviewers have complained about the notepad ordering system, and it's really not my favorite system, either. \u00a0On the other hand, folks who knew them from The Wok in Mahomet who don't read chinese will appreciate the fact that the full menu is now available in English. \u00a0One of those reviewers was perplexed about how to order a dish not-so-spicey, but it worked great for us simply to write EXTRA SPICEY next to one dish and NOT SPICEY next to another. \u00a0I feel more confident writing NOT SPICEY on the pad of paper than I do saying it. \u00a0I've had dinner there two nights in a row and still find myself craving it for dinner tonight. \u00a0My partner went for lunch yesterday and met me there again for dinner; we may have to consider just moving in! \u00a0I had the crispy tofu, which has been an absolutely favorite from the Wok in Mahomet, and my new favorite is the Snow Pea Leaves with Garlic. \u00a0I was blown away by how tasty and fresh this dish tastes. \u00a0My partner had the Cilantro Pork on Noodle and loved it. \u00a0The dumplings were awesome, and I like the vegetable egg rolls better than the regular egg rolls. \u00a0The counter staff are extremely friendly and helpful. \u00a0When I placed an order for a dish from the Diced Chicken W/ Bone, she made sure I knew that the dish I was ordering was chicken ON the bone. \u00a0She also remembered us from the Mahomet restaurant and remembered to leave the onions out of my partner's dish.I was also surprised by the dollar charge to clear your table; at the Mahomet restaurant, I always cleared my plates away and they wiped down the tables. Frankly, the prices are so good I don't mind paying an extra buck. \u00a0So this restaurant is ideal for me: \u00a0great food, no frills on the setting or service, and lower prices. \u00a0If they had full waiter service, there would be longer waits for tables, and the prices would have to be much higher. \u00a0I'd rather save the money and eat there more often!", 
      "Service: 1 StarAmbiance: 1 StarFood: 5 StarsYou will not find better Chinese food in C-U or perhaps all of Illinois.", 
      "Best chinese food. Ever. No, make that Best Chinese Vegetarian food. Ever.I'm a big fan of chinese food and when I have my cravings, I usually have to settle for places that have limited vegetarian options and greasy stir fry that tastes suspiciously like it has duck sauce or oyster sauce. Not Golden Harbor though. The vegetarian menu option runs in pages. Literally. Well, first off, there are two menus to choose from- one is the American menu and the other is the Chinese menu. Both have lots of options in tofu, eggplant and vegetables. There is a super friendly and a sweet lady (who is also the owner) up in the front who processess your orders and you can ask her any question about the dish, she will take her time to explain it to you and what it has. She also makes sure that the kitchen caters to your vegan/vegetarian needs. Once the kitchen messed up our order and we got all meat stuff. When we went back to tell her that it was not what we ordered, she was so apologetic, threw in an order of steamed vegetable dumplings for free and personally made sure that we got our right order this time. Making good food is one thing but being so customer friendly and personal for a popular restaurant is another. Having been to many popular restaurants, with bad service and arrogant owners, I will easily give this place 5 starts and more. My personal recommendation- steamed vegetable dumplings. There are 8 pieces in total and make excellent starter. The outer coat is thin and less chewy (unlike other places where the outer shell is so chewy and thick)If you are a vegetarian and in the C-U area, I would highly recommend this place.", 
      "Thumbs up for the Best Chinese food ever. \u00a0No, I am not exaggerating. \u00a0 Until I came across Golden Harbor, my Chinese food options were just limited to carry out places where I used to more often than not get the Vegetarian Fried Rice and the Vegetarian Spring Rolls but Golden Harbor to me redefined the concept of Chinese Food. \u00a0They have an elaborate menu for Vegetarians (which is very unlikely for a Chinese Restaurant) and note that none of these Vegetarian dishes contain duck sauce or oyster sauce like most of the other Chinese places. \u00a0The owner is an extremely friendly person who greets you with a smile and explains to you the menu in detail if you have any questions. \u00a0When it comes to orders, this restaurant works differently. \u00a0You have plenty of tables to sit and dine but the waiters don't come to take your order. \u00a0As soon as you enter you have a table filled with menus (both the American version and the Chinese version), a small book and some pens for you to write the order and mark it and give it to the owner at the billing counter. \u00a0The lady then gives you a token for you to take and place it on the table you sit. \u00a0Then the waiters come and deliver the food to your table.My personal favorites at this restaurant are Vegetable steamed dumplings and Spicy Hunan Vegetables.", 
      "This is Champaign, IL folks! \u00a0We don't have ANY good restaurants here, let alone, one as authentic as this one. \u00a0Went for Take Out on a Saturday at 5:45pm. \u00a0Waited in line and did not get up to the counter to order until 6:10p and food came out around 6:40p, so it takes a long time to order and be served, but in the end, the food is delicious. \u00a0I would have given it 5-stars, but waiting almost 1/2 hour in line while only one person is on cashier, is a little inefficient. \u00a0Hopefully, they will get up to speed.", 
      "Definitely worth 5 stars. \u00a0You won't get ambiance, but you will get amazing food!", 
      "It is a terrible regret that I moved away before I had a chance to become a regular at Golden Harbor. \u00a0I've been there once and the food was out of this world good. \u00a0You can have the americanized staples, which are still good, or you can get into the real stuff and just have an amazing meal. \u00a0I wish I could pack this place up and take it with me wherever I go.It does have an odd cafeteria style service. \u00a0But it's BYOB, which I would love to see more restaurants in C-U adopt.", 
      "I rarely eat Chinese food in restaurants. I find the typical American version of Chinese restaurant food to be terrible so I avoid any of the \"buffet\" type restaurants. Golden Harbor is different. It is authentic. I thoroughly enjoyed the food. It is the best Chinese food I have ever eaten. I highly recommend it.", 
      "Nice place to try Chinese food.", 
      "This was great when it was the Mandarin Wok, and it is great that the owners are back in town. \u00a0Service is minimal and you bus your own table in exchange for not having to tip (you can pre-pay like a buck or so to have it bussed if you really care), but who goes to a chinese restaurant for atmosphere? \u00a0Go for the food! \u00a0The Awesome, Awesome food!", 
      "Authentic chinese food for a good price. I went with a Chinese friend who just ordered a bunch of dishes for us; otherwise I would have had no idea what to get. We got the pork buns and crispy tofu and chow mein. All were awesome.", 
      "best asian restaurant on campus. usually i dont like eating at asian restaurants but i would go to Golden Harbor everyday. the tofu is good but a bit pricey for tofu. the salt and pepper pork is delicious. can get very busy during peak hours. pay with cash a receive a slight discount.", 
      "There is a huge difference between Chinese food and Taiwanese food. I think it's very misleading to have a restaurant bill itself as \"authentic Chinese cuisine\" then specialize in their Taiwanese dishes only. I had hoped their Chinese dishes would be good or passable at least, but their versions of Mongolian beef, Szechuan chicken, and chicken with black bean sauce were barely edible. I would give the Chinese food 2 stars and the Taiwanese food 4 stars (because the Crispy fried tofu was good) and average it all at 3 stars.Taiwanese dishes are heavy on soy sauce and sesame oil. \u00a0They can have a Malaysian influence. There are a lot of deep fried dishes. So if you prefer deep-fried food and brown sauces, as well as home-style or stewed meat, you might like this restaurant quite a bit. It's BYOB and bus your own table or pay a $1 fee, so good for feeding a large group family-style, by sharing dishes.Take a close look at the pictures that customers have attached of the food they ate here because that's what it really looks like. what wiki has to say about Taiwanese food:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta\u2026", 
      "I went to China, and had authentic Chinese food. SO basically, I know what real Chinese food taste like. Golden Harbor is AUTHENTIC CHINESE FOOD. This restaurant said screw you to the conformist chinese restaurants around campus, and created a menu that came straight from Beijing. Yes, there might be some dishes on the menu that are meant for your cookie cutter customer ie orange chicken, however the rest of the menu will blow your tongue away. Ordering maybe confusing in the beginning but the employees are really helpful. FINALLY, the best part is the amount of rice you get for your meal. As a rice connoisseur rice is vital for a good chinese experience and you most certainly get it at Golden Harbor.", 
      "SO GOOD. I have eaten at a ton of Chinese food in my life. Some of it in Taiwan, some in San Francisco (not sure which counts more...) This place stands out. Part of me can't even believe that in such a crappy little town in central illinois, there is an amazing Chinese restaurant rivalling that. This is possibly the best restaurant in the area, in any genre. Don't get individual dishes if you can help it, the menu is designed for family style dining. My favorites are crispy tofu and ma-la anything, but really, you could probably just pick anything and trust them to do it well. I have never been disappointed, and this is out of many large group dinners where I tried many dishes.",

      "Travel the world in a little shop whether it be via cheese, chocolate, spices, teas, jams, or exotic drinks. Try the bulk bins for nuts, seeds, grains and spices if you need a little of something for a recipe but you don't want to buy a huge container of it.", 
      "This place is a great retreat if you're looking for finer foods than the local campus fare. The ladies and gents at the counter are always willing to let you try a sample before you buy any of their pastries and cheese. They also make a mean baklava (with pistachios, to boot). My only critique would be that the Asian goods and foods are waaay overpriced. If you're willing to dig around a bit, there are some great Asian food stores in the area, like Am-Ko, Green Onion and Far East. Otherwise, I would definitely come here for the \u00a0luxury chocolate, cookies and organic sugar substitutes. A great little international shop, known especially for its Mediterranean food and knowledgeable staff.", 
      "This review pertains strictly to the menu. \u00a0The store itself is quite charming, and it does indeed have a variety of foods that are very excIting. \u00a0Based on other reviews, we stopped through to pick up lunch. \u00a0What an unfortunate mistake for us. \u00a0The menu features fairly-priced Mediterranean foods that sounded great. \u00a0We ordered the baba ganoush and falafel sandwiches and a vegetarian platter. \u00a0The falafel was microwaved and lost any texture it might have had when first prepared. \u00a0It had no distinguishable flavor. \u00a0The baba was so smoky, that I couldn't finish the sandwich. \u00a0Three bites overwhelmed my palette completely. \u00a0We had already purchased the dessert and gave them a shot, because they were aesthetically very pleasing. \u00a0Unfortunately, the birds nest was soft (so sad) and the date cookie was crumbled and poorly prepared. \u00a0I've never thrown away so much food. \u00a0Maybe we came on an off day, but based on our experience, my recommendation is to shut it down. \u00a0You've got a great store, why compromise your credibility with this food?", 
      "Now this is more like it! This store is full of amazing treats. Chocolate, cheese, frozen goods- everything you want, but don't really need, but will buy anyway! The owners/staffers here are so friendly and welcoming. On my first visit here, the owner invited me to come back the next day for a cheese tasting. It was like he had known me for years. All of my dearest friends know how much I love cheese! (for a more in-depth look at my life, click the link youtu.be/GxqycijBUn0 )They don't sell fresh meat or produce here- it's not that kind of store. This is your place for specialty items- treat yo self!", 
      "Great service and incredibly nice owners but the prices make my wallet weep. \u00a0A few of the more common things (some curries, pastas, etc) can be found for less in the Schnuck's international aisle. For goods from countries less well represented in CU, I suck it up and shell out. Over $20/lb for basturma? Fine, fine, take all my money.", 
      "Absolutely the best selection of random imported foods you'll find in the C-U area, topped off with a friendly and helpful staff. \u00a0It's pricey for Champaign, but that's the nature of international foods hand-selected and accumulated just for you.Absolutely GIANT tea section, which has me in heaven every time I visit. \u00a0We used to go to the tea shop downtown, but World Harvest has them so woefully beat that we don't bother anymore (which honestly makes me a bit sad, as the tea shop is an institution in my memories growing up... I suppose that's where it'll live from now on).", 
      "I'm here just to talk about the tea. OMG the tea. As an international food store, they have brands of tea that you won't find in a typical grocery store. The have a whole aisle just of tea. Both sides! And two end caps! There were so many brands and kinds that I had to remind myself that I can definitely come back, and no need to buy all the tea. The price ranged from $4-$8 for a box of 20 bags of tea. They had bulk tea, and about 8 specific tea flavors (not brands) were on sale. Unfortunately, none of those appealed to me, but I'll check back again!The owner is so nice! He chatted me up, asked me what I was studying, if I'm new to the area. Definitely made me feel welcome.", 
      "World Harvest is a little gem of a business in Champaign. They have such a diverse and complete variety of products from around the world, including ethnic foods, teas, jams, oils, spices, seeds, nuts, sweets, confectioneries, cheeses, meats, and even beauty products, it's definitely worth a visit. The owner is friendly, and he also owns Istanbul mediterranean restaurant in Champaign at the Crossing, which is a fresh and delightful winner of a business. It seems everything he is doing, he is doing right.", 
      "This store is CU's foodie mecca and for good reason- it \u00a0has everything! Primarily tailored for the needs of international students and former city-dwellers, this is the place to get everything from ghee to chevre. Only here can I indulge my desire for German Kinder chocolate, Dutch Roka cheese crispies, Middle Eastern Zaatar, and Norwegian lingonberries. They also have a good selection of local foods from nearby farms and bakeries. Prices are far more reasonable than big stores like Cost Plus World Market or similar Chicago stores. For gifts or gourmet food, this is the best place in CU!", 
      "If I lived in Champaign, I would be in trouble. \u00a0World Harvest is amazing. \u00a0Take every single ethnic market you can find and put them all together. \u00a0Add an olive bar, artisan cheeses, fresh baked breads, and all of the worldly chocolate you can handle (including kinder chocolate and Mozart balls) and you have World Harvest. \u00a0They not only have spices and dry noodles, but a large selection of frozen ethnic foods, a wall of balsamic vinegars and olive (as well as other) oils, ad did I mention the chocolates?They also had a bulk nut and dried fruit selection to choose from. \u00a0Jordan Almonds scare me... but I digress.The bakery items looked freshly made, and the staff was very friendly. \u00a0They will let you try any of the deli, cheese, or olive selections before you purchase.", 
      "This place reminds me of this insane NYC spice store with every spice in the world. It's overwhelming! Aisle after aisle of spices! All kinds of rices, jams, etc. I bought some Greek mountain tea that I've been wanting to try. This store should be in Chicago, or one like it. If you are driving by Champaign, this place is worth a pit stop. It's always fun to just look at food crap.", 
      "Wow...Wow... \u00a0All I can say is I can't believe I didn't stop in sooner. \u00a0I've been in town for 4 years and just discovered World Harvest.The owner and staff are very welcoming and helpful, which shows that they take pride in their business. \u00a0There is a very extensive selection of food from all over the world, with a delicious looking deli/cheese selection as well. \u00a0I was able to find an Eastern European bread that I've been looking for, a great looking frozen Indian dish, and my favorite French biscuits, all in one trip. \u00a0Unlike some other places, this store is clean and well organized. \u00a0I really look forward to coming back again.",

      "I really like the selection of unique foods that this place has. It also has some great gluten-free options. I love the variety of chocolates, beans, oils, candies, etc.However, I've bought some things here that have been disappointing to say the least. Once I bought a rice mix and then when I opened it, I was dismayed to find several dead worms and larvae in it. Yuck! I also bought a can of coconut milk and opened it and it was as thick as mud and very sour. Obviously well past its prime. That really irks me. Some of the products have been sitting on the shelves for god knows how many years. Decades possibly. They need to have a more professional attitude and throw out all the expired food.", 
      "World Harvest is definitely my favorite import/specialty foods store in C-U. The staff is super friendly, the place is clean, and the prices are generally pretty reasonable. And the cheese...mmmm...the cheese. They have an awesome selection of cheeses, all of which they're happy to let you sample. Most importantly, they have Lurpak (a popular brand of Danish butter). Mmmmmm....butter.", 
      "As I sit here finishing my very fresh schaumk\u00fcsse, I reflect on how awesome this store really is, and how lucky we are to have such great owners who really listen to what their patrons want!In fact, just a few months ago they did not have schaumk\u00fcsse (and I had not really remembered them carrying it prior to this moment). I knew this because I asked the owner. Only a few weeks later I came in and there they were! It seems that since then they have started keeping them in stock non-stop. Thus, this is the best international store in Champaign-Urbana.", 
      "I'm not going to repeat what the other reviewers have said about the selection and the great cheeses and the tasty halal/kosher local meats -- it's all true.The place also has all kinds of cool cosmetics and grooming products from other countries. They have several different kinds of henna, powdered and in tubes, ranging from poor quality to good quality. They have some cool Islamic items like tooth cleaning materials made from traditional miswak, fancy imported dates, and Arab keffiyeh scarves. They have this aromatic Lebanese soap made from olives and imported oils and tinctures I had never heard of before. It's really cool. And omg it's cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeap!",

I'm always pleasantly surprised when I stop in here, whether it's for a delicious treat or that hard-to-find ingredient. . . oh, and the baklava's devine.", 
      "This is a really neat store to browse, and if you're looking for a specialty ingredient you'll probably find it here. \u00a0However, consider other options before you actually buy something. \u00a0It's almost definitely cheaper elsewhere. \u00a0If you don't feel like shopping around or stopping at multiple stores to get what you need, just be aware that you're paying extra for the convenience of a one-stop-shop. \u00a0Also, check expiration dates. \u00a0I forgot to do so last time I shopped here, and ended up with some lovely stale food. \u00a0I do like to stop here and buy a few things as an occasional indulgence, but in general it's just too expensive.Their halva is fantastic, though--seriously, the best.", 
      "Check on expiration date... But otherwise awesome...They have a great variety of international food. Best place to get Argentinian food (Dulce de leche, yerba mate, masa de empenadas y tarta)...", 
      "I like world harvest. I go there for cheese, chocolate, pita bread, grains, jam ... that kind of stuff. And its good. They have many things you cannot find elsewhere. However, they WILL sell you rotten food. We bought goat cheese on \"sale\" that was 3 weeks past the sell by date. And I found worms in the rice once. Right there on the shelf with all the other foods. Kind of off-putting. I told the management and they argued that the cheese was totally fine. Um ... maybe, but 3 weeks past the date? They said, \"oh yea, totally fine.\" Unacceptable to receive no compassion for the fact that they sold me 3 week old cheese. Update: the cheese is still on the shelf a week later. A month old. Is that even legal?Two years ago, I would have also given this a 5-star rating. Today, just 2. Just stop selling rotten foods. It's THAT easy.And don't eat the falafel sandwich either. Its soggy and gross.",

      "i like world harvest. \u00a0i don't love it. \u00a0they have amazing baklava. \u00a0i mean... uh.maze.ing. \u00a0i could eat it all day long. \u00a0however, if you get the deli food... it's just... meh. \u00a0i got a couple falafel sandwiches that were promptly heated \u00a0up in a microwave. \u00a0the hummus has a strange flavor that i can't put my finger on. \u00a0i haven't eaten tuna in about 25 years, but honestly, this hummus tasted like tuna smells. \u00a0just kinda strange. i don't prefer it over other places in town. \u00a0i certainly wouldn't go out of my way to get it.the selection in this store is overwhelming. \u00a0any AND every kind of ethnic or health food is contained on these shelves. \u00a0if you can't find it somewhere else, you can probably find it here. \u00a0there is a wide selection of spices and dried beans and spices. \u00a0lots of gluten free alternatives for pasta and flour. \u00a0i was surprised by how many raw vegan things there were, actually. \u00a0however, one raw bar was almost $5, and even, raw \"boutique\" prices... $5 is kind of steep. \u00a0lots of things in here are on the expensive side.i would come in again if i need something unique that i couldn't find anywhere else, but this would not be my dedicated shopping site. \u00a0the service is super nice, though.", 
      "I do not want Sriracha sauce. \u00a0I need sriracha sauce. \u00a0Also baklava, organic chocolate, gouda with basil and garlic and maybe some ginger beer. \u00a0All of which World Harvest is more than prepared to sell me. \u00a0They have a nice selection of the yuppie luxury items I'd expect in such a store - olive oil, mustard, chocolate, dried pasta, etc. \u00a0Basically everything I'd think of as \"contraband\" if there was a war on. \u00a0And while I can't speak for 100% of the store-made goods, I will say that the cashew baklava is mighty fine stuff. \u00a0Plus, the prices on all of it seem very reasonable.I took off a star because... I'm a snob. \u00a0Because I want more. \u00a0I'd like a bigger cheese selection with more of a display and some fois gras. \u00a0Not that kibbi isn't also excellent, but I'd like you to indulge my stuffwhitepeoplelike attitude just a tad bit more please. \u00a0The store could also stand to have a couple hundred more square feet, perhaps filled with a nice wine selection. \u00a0There really aren't enough places to buy a decent Malbec in this town, maybe this place could be one?All in all, an excellent establishment that I will never be able to just walk past. \u00a0Surely one piece of baklava can't hurt me.", 
      "Shopping here is a joy. So many international-type food stores are focused on one country or region at the expense of all others. This place has everything. EVERYTHING. The cheeses! the cookies! the spices! the strange canned foods from around the world! Plus, halal meats and everything. Oh what fun.", 
      "The freshest Feta cheese. The hugest selection of Thai and Indian grocery items. Nice/pretty/intelligent/ethnic/artsy girls behind the counter who elaborately answer every single dumb question that I invent about olives or cheese. This place makes dreams come true! I LOVE you World Harvest Foods!", 
      "This place is where my love of cheese and wine is satisfied. It is also a great place to get delicious chocolate and olives. Me and my boyfriend are both a huge fan of this place. They also have a tasting on saturdays.", 
      "They have a wonderful selection of cheeses, especially Western European styles. Another strong point is the chocolate... they even the hard-to-find Callebaut baking chocolate.Their selection of olive oil, balsamic and sherry vinegars is unmatched.The only (mild) disappointment I have is that they don't have fresh, locally-baked flatbreads, like you see in similar places in larger cities.", 
      "I love this place! \u00a0Upon my move to Urbana from Boston, I immediately went to World Harvest. \u00a0They have absolutely every odd ingredient I've looked for there. \u00a0They have Castelvetrano olives, which I thought would be impossible to find in CU. \u00a0Lots of delicious cheeses, which they will always let you try before you buy. \u00a0Sometimes they give away free chocolate! \u00a0What more could you want?", 
      "I love this place. \u00a0They have expanded and it just keeps getting better. \u00a0They have a wide assortment of international foods, especially Indian, Mexican, Middle Eastern. \u00a0They have a great selection of olive oils, pasta, tea, jellies and jams, condiments, and candies. \u00a0Saturday is cheese and olive tasting and they have a wonderful selection of both. \u00a0Prices are very reasonable and the quality is high. \u00a0The owner, Mohammed, is a very friendly, kind, gracious, helpful man who is a pleasure to know. \u00a0I can't say enough good things about this store and its owner. \u00a0Go there. \u00a0Walk the aisles. \u00a0Sample the cheese and olives. \u00a0Stock your cart or basket with a wide array of goodies. \u00a0You will become a regular just as I have.", 
      "I can always count on World Harvest having whatever I need to make a special meal. Knowledgeable staff make great recommendations and know their merchandise.", 
      "I love World Harvest! They have a huge selection of stuff, but I most often go here for a handful of things:-Falafel sandwiches-Cheese. For a given type of cheese, it is usually cheaper here than the grocery store, and of course the selection is far superior.-Halal meats, but especially sausage. Italian sausage, soujuk, and merguez are all usually available here.-OlivesThe staff is really helpful and will answer any questions about their huge and sometimes bewildering selection.", 
      "Food is pretty expensive, huge variety though - always check the expiration dates they tend to have so much stuff that a lot doesn't get bought before they expire from my observation. Also just bought a box of cookies which were packaged separately inside - the seal on both packages was broken - they tasted good but just wanted to make people aware (Les Galettes Caramel de La Mere Poulard).", 
      "Just when I thought I'd seen all of the international food stores in the Champaign area, I found World Harvest! The employees were courteous and very helpful! When I asked for a special mexican dessert that I've only found in my home town, I was surprised when the owner came out and asked me if I would bring the wrapper of the dessert so that he could try to have it ordered! I was also fascinated by the variety of foods, drinks, sauces, chocolate, you-name-it. They even have a lot of organic items. I definately recommend shopping here!", 
      "Great place for international foods in champaign", 
      "They have good variety of brands and items and although they're priced fairly high, it's understandable. They do have a warm food counter, however, from what I noticed, they use a microwave to warm up the food which some don't like. Their warm food is ok but not something I would go out of my way to get. They've improved cleanliness throughout their shelves/isles which was a problem in the past especially when you take a product off of the shelves with a good amount of dust covering it. But again, that's all understandable assuming some products don't sell as frequently. I've questioned the warm food hygiene since it is located near the cash register and employees are often switching back and forth between handling cash and serving food. They've always used gloves or spatulas but those that have the knowledge are aware of reaching over uncovered food containers to rich a product placed closer to the front of the display and the fact that bacterial and etc, can easily come from an employee's skin/clothes/etc, while reaching over. The above are all justifiable based on their location/resources and other factors that limit their operations. What I don't understand is $10 minimum requirement to use Credit/Debit cards. I'm a frequent customer at this business and I look past all the faults that I stated above. However when I rush over during a few free minutes only to be turned down because of a purchase of less than $10 when I only have my debit card to pay with? That doesn't speak highly of the management/owners or the employees because what I spend at this business is well over the transaction charge. This is a small convenient store slightly larger than an average sized 7-Eleven and they sell many items that are less than the $10 requirement. Greedy? Maybe but regardless of the title any one of us chooses for their practices, the lack of competition in this area shouldn't give the owners a reason or excuse to have ignorant policies. $10 minimum? I would even let a $5 minimum slide but $10 is pushing it.Bottom line, take cash with you or don't walk in unless you're willing to spend more than $10 which I almost always do, except this one day. They may lack local competition but the internet is very close and I can most definitely purchase the same products for cheaper or the same, including the shipping charge. Not good business practices for a local business that depends on local clients.If you don't care about that, then more power to you and enjoy your shopping experience.", 
      "I think it is has \u00a0great selection and I felt welcome...I was given a hair care tip..mustard oil....very cool", 
      "While I certainly appreciated the variety of ethnic food that World Harvest offers, I was very disturbed to find two small dead worms on a box of Spanish rice I was about to buy (at first I thought it was two grains of rice which made me even more disturbed). That is just not acceptable for a grocery store. If you are going there, be sure to look over all of your items before purchasing.", 
      "I love this place. The frozen parathas, the goat, the foreign cookies and chocolates, the spices, - I love it all. I know this kind of product is expensive to sell, so I won't complain about prices, though I do have some trouble affording it. Friendly and helpful service."

      "On the one hand, Legends is in my opinion the best campustown/Green Street bar. On the other hand, it's still a college bar. But it's my favorite and thus 5 stars.Great atmosphere, never overly crowded the way some of the other dumps on campus are, often you're able to grab a seat, even on some of the busiest nights. My favorite night was Tuesday nights - Ride the Rail, and yes I completed my rail card senior year. I've got my name up on the wall which is very cool but I've got so many great memories of sitting around having beers with friends. And, I have to say, the beer selection's pretty good actually. They always have a few good drafts on top of the normal college bar cheap, watered down stuff. Nothing elaborate, but good quality mass produced stuff - Sam Adams Seasonals, Woodchuck, etc.The food's surprisingly good as well. I would say Firehaus has better food, but as far as green street bars go, that's probably it. I generally stuck with burgers or chicken sandwiches and they have a good selection of toppings to put on whatever food you get.But you really go to Legends for the atmosphere. It's an upperclassman bar where you can go to actually hang out and talk with friends. They have good music playing in the background but it's never all that loud and it's stuff you want to listen to anyway. They've got some slot machines and pool tables now which also make for a good time and there's a dressed model of the Chief up front which is a welcome sight for any Illini.", 
      "For one of the \"main\" campus sports bars, the television angles were not optimal when seated in the back by the kitchen order window. \u00a0You really had to twist your head around or rearrange the 50lb barstools.Oddly, the only tv in the joint that didn't have the Illini playing was the one nearest to our table and we got in before the student crowds woke up.The Nachos Supreme w/chicken were anything but...Still, they packed 'em in and turned over some crowd so it'll be around for eternity.", 
      "Meh...typical college bar. Good selection. Fair prices, but sticky floors & tables...food was ok. My kids like it. Good location. Needs a scrubbing!", 
      "It is a college bar that reminded me of Fatty's Pub and Grill in DeKalb. Nothing special except Chief Illiniwek (I think that's how you spell it) is in the house!Nachos Supreme (sorry, I hate nachos) and burgers were ordered. Beer was consumed. Men scratched themselves. This is a sports bar in a college town. I bet a lot of puke has been cleaned from the floor. Nice looking beer garden (growing beer in there, right?). I would not go back because my palette requires a little more \"oomph\".", 
      "Legendarily lame.This place has managed to successfully wage a campaign against fun for more than a decade. Tactics include: carefully measuring out each shot with a measuring cup while making mixed drinks and charging four dollars above market price for shitty food.Going to legends is like having the hot water cut out in the middle of a shower. It's like getting your scrotum caught while zipping up your fly. It's like watching Schindler's List during a bachelor party. It's like clogging the toilet at your girlfriend's parent's house. Not fun at all.", 
      "Legends is a University of Illinois favorite for watching football games and grabbing a beer. While watching a game and enjoying a brew bar food is always great to tame your appetite. The cheeseburger at Legends is a typical bar-style burger. Featuring a sesame bun, a thin patty, and topped with the works. The classic flavors are all their with the burger at Legend's, however nothing is necessarily exceptional. The bun, beef, and topping could all bring more to the table. It is not the best burger in Champaign, but Legends is definitely one of the best places to watch a game. The burger will satisfy you if you have a craving while enjoying a night with friends.", 
      "Love it love it. Went here, hungover, on a Sunday in hopes of watching a game - and nursing the hangover. I had a delicious chicken wrap with french fries. I liked the all-wood interior, gave the place a nice feel to it. They also have a few games in the back...I think I saw Buck Hunter?Whenever I return to UofI to party, I'll definitely hit this up in the evening to see how it is then.", 
      "Comparing this not only to other bars at U of I but other college bars in general. \u00a0There beer selection is average at best recommend the Sams Adams octoberfest on tap a pint for 3 dollars or any leninkugels on tap. \u00a0They have daily drink specials, two dollar long islands on Thursdays, Friday yaegar shots 2 dollars.The food is your average bar food burgers, some wraps, wings, nachos, for fries have to pay 2 dollars extra. \u00a0The real annoying part of this place is the food is ordered at the bar than picked up by you when the number is called. \u00a0There is no hostess or waitstaff all self serve and first come first serve on tables. \u00a0You could be waiting hours for a table at this place recommend you get there at 6:00pm before the late night rush!!!", 
      "Amongst the many other campus bars, Legends is truly a find - a not so well hidden diamond in the rough.The drink prices are reasonable for campus and amazing when compared to Chicago. \u00a0The food here appears to be your regular run of the mill bar grub, but alas, there is something special about those loaded fries. \u00a0Their half off appetizer deal on Fridays is pretty sweet too. \u00a0But my all time favorite is the Legends Ranch Chicken served only on Mondays. \u00a0I'd call in sick for that.Don't miss out on their Long Islands ($5 on Mondays)... they're seemingly innocent which makes them all the more lethal.", 
      "I had a fish sandwich here, it was okay. I drank beer here, but not the one I wanted because their selection is pretty poor. I looked at a giant chief statue, and got super creeped out.In sum, I really do not like this place and avoid it as much as possible.", 
      "Be careful what you ask for at this popular Campus Town location. \u00a0Legends is known for their hamburgers, their Friday Fish Fry's and their different kind of wraps. But straying from those favorites might make you wish you hadn't. (Case in point, I had the grilled cheese with tomato and it came out entirely sopping with butter.) They do have an island, though, that offers up all the best condiments - make sure to try the pickles, they're out of this world! Food comes out fairly fast, though it can be unreliable in a party of more than two. \u00a0Food is always at the right temperature and they make french fries just the way I like them, crisp and not greasy! \u00a0Don't go to Legends to drink. \u00a0As a matter of fact, outside of a few places in town, I recommend doing your drinking at home (your wallet will thank you). \u00a0The prices are insane and watching them measure out your liquor makes it feel like you're getting shafted. \u00a0Legends is also not a place to go if you want to skip big crowds on weekends. \u00a0It's usually packed on game days (whatever the game), but it's also relatively quiet on weekdays, so it's ideal for lunch. \u00a0Plus, they also have a parking lot (one of the only ones off Green) and that makes it a real keeper.", 
      "Legends has the benefit of being close to Green/Wright, making it easily accessible, and a frequent #2 stop on barcrawls. Never any cover, Legends is ALWAYS crowded on weekend nights.And no reason not to; their drinks are cheap, space plentiful, and their pool tables are not slanted on the ground. A great place for happy hours, and just the occasional night out. Also, you cannot have a barcrawl if it doesn't go to Legends.If only they would stop repainting the exterior wackier and wackier every 2 years...", 
      "This is one of those places that deserved *ZERO STARS* if Yelp would allow it. \u00a0We asked if there was table service before 9 of us sat down in a large booth. \u00a0Big mistake!The same waitress that told us to have a seat came over about 20 minutes later. \u00a0During that time, some of us went to the bar out of shear frustration. \u00a0Bigger mistake.They came back from the bar after another 20+ minutes without drinks. \u00a0At that point we had been there for almost an hour and my alcohol dependency started to give me the shakes.We finally got the drinks from the server and asked for our check so we could leave immediately. \u00a0Despite saying that we could pay however we'd like and she just needed a card to \"hold\", she insisted on swiping the one card for the whole bill. \u00a0The reason: \"It's just too busy to bring you the check\". \u00a0If that was a busy night, I would hate to see what that place looks like when it's slow. \u00a0The icing on the proverbial cake was the *BROKEN GLASS* I found in my cocktail. \u00a0The server was disinterested in my future digestive issues resulting from the shards of glass and lurked over the table as we signed the check.", 
      "One of the cleaner C-U bars, Legends is a pretty nice place (while keeping in mind that everything's relative). \u00a0I've never seen nor heard of this place charging cover - even on Mom's/Dad's weekend, and good bar food during the day (especially the fish sandwich).Generally one of the less packed bars, it's a good place to sit down with some friends and play some drinking games, pool, darts, or just chill and talk - note how I said talk, not scream at the top of your lungs. \u00a0They have a full bar and play whatever the current hits are at night, but no one actually dances sans a helluva lot of alcohol. \u00a0It's also a great place to go on game days as they have a nice, big, flat-screen TV, and plenty of booths/bar stools to crowd around, watch, and cheer for your team. \u00a0Go Illini!", 
      "Legends: a place that is stuck between being a bad restaurant and a bad bar. \u00a0The place is setup quite a bit like a restaurant with all the booths and tables in the place, and with waitresses that come around and try to get you to order more drinks. However, the burgers here are really bad: they seem to be cheap, frozen, store-bought patties that are generally overcooked and not so tasty. \u00a0Their prices don't make up for it either; who wants to pay $6 for a burger that is worse than McDonald's? The bar portion also pretty bad. \u00a0It's always hard to get the attention of the bartenders. \u00a0Once you do get their attention, you're likely in for some crappy tasting beer. \u00a0All the taps here taste a little foul; maybe they just don't know how to clean them? \u00a0The good side of Legends is that it's almost never crowded, and usually not too loud. \u00a0They also have a few projectors they use to show Illini games, so that can be nice. \u00a0So, if you're not too much of a beer snob, this isn't a bad place to go and knock a few back.", 
      "Honestly, this is the same as most any other bar. This one falls to the pub style rather than the disgusting bump and grind style. Good place to get a table and hang out. An extra star because they sell playing cards for a buck. Really cheap, awful, uncoated, unshufflable, undealable, soak up beer faster than any paper I've ever seen playing cards, but playing cards all the same. My friends and I aren't smart enough to bring our own, so this saves us. But they lose a star for having recently eliminated the internet jukebox and added a DJ. How else can we play \"In the Air Tonight\" to kill the mood at 1am? We actually paid the dude a fiver and left him an iPod to get something played that wasn't part of the standard littany of horrible bar songs.", 
      "It's nearly impossible for me to give any Illinois campus bar more than 3 stars but Legends comes close.Yeah, sometimes the service can be downright lousy but compared to anywhere else, it's par for the course. \u00a0Legends' best attributes are the many TV's available to take in the game and the space for people to spread out. \u00a0If you're nice and it's not too busy the staff might even put on the game you request. \u00a0It's not too tough for a few people to lock down a good chunk of space here which is what makes it a winner. \u00a0The patio is a decent size and appealing when it's nice out.The prices are about campus average and the tap selection sucks. \u00a0The main draw is coming here on Wednesday and doing the venerable \"School of Beer\" (which should be renamed \"Buy our entire bottle list\") which features more enjoyable selections than what is on draft and awesome prices ($4 max per beer, usually less).Definitely my go-to if I feel like drinking on campus without being heavily annoyed. \u00a0Also, if you look like someone who used to work here, current employees will ask to take their picture with you or stare at you from across the bar.", 
      "Legends has food?? Seriously?? How come I did not know this? They make a fabulous Sex on the Beach. The drink prices are reasonable. The noise level is tolerable. And it's always fun to challenge your crush to a game or two here. That being said...and for all the time I spent here...I still didn't know they served food!", 
      "After a disappointing visit to Murphy's on Wednesday evening for a burger, I decided to try Legend's on my way out of town late Thursday afternoon. \u00a0I was not disappointed.It's a bar - bar food, beer, booths and stools. \u00a0The food is actually quite good. \u00a0This was probably my 3rd or 4th visit and it will now be my 'go to' spot for a burger when I'm in Champaign. \u00a0Did I say that the girls here were much, much more attractive than over at Murphy's?", 
      "I feel like this is the bar that people go to when Firehaus is packed and you still want to catch a Chicago/Illinois sports team game. They've got plenty of seats and some pretty good specials (except for hose god-awful meme glasses, *shudder*). It also seems to be a favorite for older people who visit during conventions/career fairs. I've never seen so many polo shirts and khakis in one venue.All in all, Friday happy hour is pretty good here and so is Ride the Rail, but if you are looking for a night which you might call \"Legendary\", I doubt this is the place where it's gonna happen.", 
      "I cant stand this bar. The bartender was a jerk to me and I swear to godits the slowest service ever. I went on Tuesday because my friends like doing the stupid ride the rail thing because God knows no one would ever go here otherwise. It takes forever to get a drink. They only pour beer! I hate this place because I paid for a drink with accredit card and the bartender told me to not do it again. I want to punch that guy so bad. I am so glad me and my friends don't go here often. I strongly suggest pickingmurphys over this abomination of terrible service. And the student newspaper voted them for best service! I don't know what that writer must have been smoking but it must have been extra strong. Never go here.", 
      "The big pro is the location in Campus Town. Most nights they also have food specials and the bar is usually very clean and service is fine. The \u00a0big con is the food. I have eaten here several times and the food is just simply bland, mediocre bar food which is overpriced. This seems like another place that hustles the students with little value for the money.", 
      "A lot of people I know hate on this bar, but I think they're expecting something akin to what you find at the other campus bars. \u00a0Legends is the perfect place to stroll into with a big group of people, as there's rarely a line and with the bar in the middle of the building, it's accessible from wherever your group decides to sit.No, you can't really get your dance on here, even though there's a lot of space...but if you're just looking to get a good buzz, you won't miss that. \u00a0The large area does make it enjoyable for happy hours though.Food's pretty good. \u00a0I like Murphy's burgers better, but I like the ranch chicken sandwiches and fish sandwiches from here.It's not the most bumpin' bar in Champaign, but it's the best place to come and chill with some friends. \u00a0Or roll in with a ton of people, take up a quarter of the bar, and do shots until they kick you out. \u00a0Either way.", 
      "I-L-L-I-N-I. What? You didn't realize this is an Illini bar? How could you not tell from the blue and traffic cone orange facade?This is a great place to bring a group, because the venue is huge - as in, \"host an entire 200+ class with room for other people to grab dinner here\" huge. It is also conveniently located on Green street, the apparently \"happening\" area of this town, with a pay-to-park parking lot adjacent to it.I didn't have food or alcohol so I cannot comment on those.I am a big fan of the StepNPull in the women's bathroom. Finally, someone acknowledges that I don't want to touch a probably dirty door handle after washing my hands!", 
      "Have to say, at 3PM on a monday afternoon, this place was actually not too shabby. \u00a0It was clean, had on some nice soothing tunes, we were the only people there so we got super fast service, and when I went back to pick up my french fries (which were actually good enough to entice my friend who didn't want any and doesn't usually eat french fries to eat some) I actually observed the line cook spraying down some cleanser and wiping an already clean counter. \u00a0The fish sandwhich is allegedly \"the best,\" but I've never had it. \u00a0I wouldn't be surprised if it were worth trying.", 
      "Legends is one of my \"must go to\" bars when back in town. \u00a0I've had many a fun night here. \u00a0Wed nights back in the day was $1 bottles and $2 neon drinks or something like that. \u00a0Fun times. \u00a0Wait staff and bartenders were always nice. \u00a0Legends always had an \"older\" crowd since there was no dancing and there's pool tables in the back.Food - taco salad, how I love thee. \u00a0I haven't found a taco salad in the city that compares. \u00a0It's HUGE and actually has a lot of lettuce! \u00a0Cheap too, even for a college student.", 
      "The things I love most about this place are the Tuesday evenings - working on the Rail Card. Outside of that, I don't care for this place a whole lot, but I do appreciate the size. Nice, large establishment with multiple pool tables, large screens, and an outdoor seating area. It is very beneficial to just walk up to the bar when you get there to order your food. Then you can pick it up near the back. This is the quickest and easiest way to order here!Food is OK, in my opinion not up to par with other campus establishments, but do they offer a nice selection of beers on tap.", 
      "One of the better campus bars. \u00a0Great place for relaxing, having a couple beers and taking in a game or three - slightly different story Friday and Saturday nights when it's packed wall-to-wall.", 
      "This place opened up while I was in college. At first, it was a somewhat upscale choice to Murphys and didn't get all the fraternity/sorority traffic, but that did start to change after a while. I was surprised when I went back to see that they've changed their familiar brick exterior with something that looks like school colored siding, kinda tacky. Still, the food was good and my woodchuck cold.", 
      "for those of you present in CU prior to the late 90's, you would remember this as Deluxe, home of the Friday Fish Sandwich. \u00a0Deluxe is no more but this structure sits on the burial ground of where Deluxe once stood. \u00a0i try not to think about Deluxe when i'm in legends otherwise i feel like i'm looking for my dead dog among a litter of perfectly fresh purebred puppies. \u00a0You kind of have to treat Legends this way, like a fresh puppy. \u00a0Grow with it, create your own tricks together, develop a routine, find comfort in it, know it's always there when you need it.If you can detect different ratios of pepsi syrup to carbonated water when you drink a fountain pepsi, i challenge you find a better ratio than what is going on here. \u00a0it's a science and they have the titration juuuuust right. \u00a0when i used to consume a juicy burger, this was my destination of choice. \u00a0now i thoroughly enjoy the greek wrap minus the chicken and still feel i have consumed enough oil to be guilty. \u00a0the fries are awesome too. \u00a0good university crowd to go along with all the university memorabelia on the walls. \u00a0nice staff primarily made up of college kids from the suburbs who always seem to smile and do their jobs well. \u00a0the fish sandwich still exists on fridays but i just haven't been able to bring myself to consume one...", 
      "I want to like Legends more. I've been there a couple of times to watch various sporting events, and I love how the staff will obligingly change the channel for you if you want to see a different game. However, the hamburgers are a bit weak. My boyfriend and I went there after the depressing Illinois-Penn State game this past weekend and we were starving. Admittedly we were drunk too, but we were immediately hungry after we ate our burgers. Also I don't think the burgers come with fries. We were a bit disappointed to see bags of chips. I do like the way you can put your own stuff on the burgers and all, and the toppings are nice and fresh. Maybe next time I'll order something else! I am nothing if not magnanimous.", 
      "The grill kicks out good food, but no one goes here primarily for the food. \u00a0Come here Thursday's for \"Logo Night.\" \u00a0The beer is cheaper and at the end it all you get to stagger home with a bar glass. \u00a0The ambience is sports bar, but when there's not a big game in the afternoon it's seldom noisy or crowded. \u00a0I have come here many times after class to get a burger a beer and catch up on studying.", 
      "We try and go there for the best fish sandwich in town ! Be sure and order the beer batter onion rings also. A quaint Illini sports bar with a nice atmosphere and \u00a0easy access. A pay parking lot is right next door.", 
      "Yet another sports bar that's on campus. \u00a0Don't get the \u00a0mushroom soup here even though it sounds awesome!", 
      "Ok beer selection, ok bar food (though I am a bit of a beer/food snob). \u00a0I don't mind going when a group wants to go, but not my first choice if I'm out on my own.", 
      "Ugh. \u00a0This garish place, recently repainted, is in the spot of a storied bar and eatery, The Deluxe. \u00a0This place existed before campus got swanked up over the last number of years. \u00a0It is a big yawning space, with marginal food and service. \u00a0They have the nerve to serve something called the \"deluxe\" fish sandwich, which is not as good as their predecessor, nor as good as Derald's (campus catering truck) or Seaboat, both of which are institutions. \u00a0Guess I am old school on this one.", 
      "Absolute love this place! I swear, senior year, there were weeks where we went probably 3 or 4 nights in a row. Great for a chill night with friends, but I especially like it during the day. The happy hour deals on food are fantastic, and the food is actually really good. We also really enjoyed the outdoor seating area out back. Oh by the way, next time you are there, order a Sex on the Beach. They have their own special way of making it....realllly good and I've never seen it done anywhere else!", 
      "I used to like this bar when I was in college, on occasion. I definitely had some good times there, and the outdoor area was nice. I haven't had their food so I can't speak for that, but I just remember it being sort of average overall.", 
      "If you're hungry and looking for a good meal, do not come here. I cannot comprehend how their burgers were ever voted best in Champaign.", 
      "I'm torn about Legends. On one hand, they've got a pretty good selection of whiskeys for a Campustown bar (I got Bulliet out of a very dusty looking bottle). On the other hand, the food's pretty weak; I'd rather eat a burger at Meatheads or Five Guys any day of the week. Beer selection is okay, though."

      "This place is great. On point with all things Chipotle. Could be a little cleaner but the food is consistently good, staff nice, and they handle a busy large crowd excellent.", 
      "This Chipotle looks like any other, serving up your fresh, stereotypical Mexican cuisine. \u00a0Service: The workers here are a bit terse and pretty inefficient compared to the Chipotles in Chicago. \u00a0But then again, there is much higher traffic in Chicago... \u00a0Thank goodness I didn't come when school already started...!Food: The quality here is just as good as any other Chipotle :)", 
      "Champaign chipotle serves decent food but it has two strikes against it.1. The line for this restaurant borders on the absurd. I've seen times where the line wraps around the restaurant then out the door. I've even seen people lining up before the restaurant has even opened. If you like waiting in long lines to eat passable mexican food then this is the place for you.2. The portions tend to be on the skimpy side. I've been to chipotles across the country, and I have noticed that this one gives the smallest portions. It doesn't really matter for the management because the demand they have is abusrd, but it us upsetting. Chipotle isnt cheap for that they provide.If you have time, I'd recommend going to Maize instead. You still have to wait in an crazy line, but the food will actually be worth the wait and walk.", 
      "Liked the food a lot. Exciting and exotic taste no matter how you choose to mix up the ingredients. However I'm not always happy with the service. Staff a little rude and inpatient. Maby just to busy? Also portion varies each time I go there.", 
      "A popular lunch and dinner place with the campus crowd, there is almost always a line of some sort at Chipotle. Unfortunately, the line is pretty slow. It's not uncommon to see the line backed up, wrapping around some of the tables, because of one or two orders that seemed to have thrown off the staff. If you are the type to plan ahead, order online, so you can just walk up to the pick up register and get your food almost immediately. It is also quite common to have to repeat yourself when ordering; this is largely due to the noise level inside during lunch and dinner hours.Chipotle has burritos, bowls, salads, and tacos (and more on a secret menu). Just about everyone gets a burrito or a bowl and you're likely to get more for your money with those two. It's easy for a burrito to get over packed if you're the type to get everything on it, so you might want to opt for a bowl instead. The chicken is arguably the best meat option here. The steak is chewy, the barbacoa is boring, and the carnitas are dry and under spiced. A pork travesty. Veggies (green peppers and onions) are free, but they won't ask if you want it, you'll have to be explicit.Note that the food here is not true mexican, but very Americanized.Chips, salsa, and guac here are all good. Note that if you want guac on your burrito or bowl, it costs extra.They don't have Dr. Pepper in the soda fountain. :(What I've said so far might not seem deserving of a 4 star rating, but the reason this place is 4 stars is because of the price. A little less than $7 bucks gets you a HUGE amount of food.", 
      "Champaign Chipotle sucks. Honestly, I love Chipotle. I've had it in numerous places, always enjoyed a big juicy burrito, but this one... The worst of the worst. My burrito was half-sized, and most of the ingredients were overhelmed by rice and beans. Barbacoa was tough and dry... Rice was dry too, Corn was pale and weird. Pretty much all of the ingredients tasted different!Never again.", 
      "Ok - it's no El Charro. But if I had to pick a chain restaurant on campus, I'd go with Chipotle. Especially now that Chipotle isn't owned by McDonald's anymore - I feel better about endorsing them. Their veggie burrito bowls are very filling and the majority of the ingredients are organic, naturally raised, sustainable, hormone free and sometimes, even locally grown! It is truly Food With Integrity, like their ads claim. And anyone who goes to Qdoba (greasy barf) is out of their mind.", 
      "Gut bomb.Filled with more rice and beans than anything else, so not even really worth the price.", 
      "I love it!", 
      "Let me start this off by saying I LOVE Chipotle. \u00a0I could eat it everyday if I could afford that. \u00a0I've been to them in Champaign/Chicago/etc. \u00a0They're great and deserve five stars.The problem with this Chipotle in particular- THE LINE. \u00a0Holy hell. \u00a0Everytime I would think to myself, \"I want Chipotle\" I'd look in and see a line wrapping around the building. \u00a0Of course I waited in it, but it took forever. \u00a0This isn't a one time occuring thing either- there is always a LINE. \u00a0I think it's because of the online orders, backing everything up. Either way, the food and everything is still excellent, it's just a long wait.", 
      "I was a late bloomer when it came to Chipotle, and I now love it. I regret not eating it sooner. I wish they had more than one location, because if you don't live close to it and don't feel like going on campus at that certain time, you're out of luck. But it's across from an Urban Outfitters, double trouble.I'm a fan of the guacamole, and I think the chips are delicious. My weapon of choice is a chicken burrito, but the tortillas are a little too thin. Maybe my add-ons are just too much, but the thin tortilla never makes it to the end in one piece. Then everything kinda turns into a clusterfuck. But nonetheless, it's very tasty. Line can be long but usually moves fast, friendly staff. Two thumbs way up, holiday fun for the whole family.", 
      "One of my peers is a native of Mexico and I asked him what he really felt about this place. His exact words were \"It's just like Taco Bell.\" It's nice to get a native's perspective on our Americanized Mexican food. I gotta say that the food is fairly delicious and filling though but it does cost a bit too much for it.", 
      "Okay, so I know it's owned by McDonald's, and after watching Super Size Me, I will never eat at that place again. But wow, I don't care if it's going to clog the crap out of my arteries, I LOVE CHIPOTLE. Then after being in Florida for school for so long, my obsession with Chipotle became clear. Their chicken fajita burritos and their salsa are just soo good! It's also nice that you're able to get a Corona on the side if you want. MMmmm.UPDATE!Melissa M right below me just informed me that McDonalds no longer owns Chipotle. EAT UP!", 
      "I love the fact that the prices are about the same no matter if you're getting three tacos, burrito, or burrito bowl. \u00a0It's not authentic Mexican food.. but it surely tastes good. \u00a0I also like how they don't charge more for extra peppers and onions. \u00a0I do think you are a bit mislead though.. you might think you may be eating healthy.. but one visit to their website and you learn that you eat about 1000 calories per burrito. So.. if you're looking to eat healthy, I definetely wouldn't eat here.The seating is a bit limited here.. they have some seats upstairs. \u00a0I don't like how they don't really clean off the tables.. so it may require some self service. \u00a0But I love the fact they use Tabasco sauce.", 
      "Chipotle may not be authentic Mexican, but it does set itself apart from other chains. The primary reason to go to Chipotle is the quality of the ingredients. Niman Ranch pork is ten times more juicy and delectable than the factory farmed version. It's also much more humanely raised and ecologically friendly. Chipotle braises the pork with pepper and other mild spices and the tender and flavorful result is what keeps me coming back all the time. There are lots of other options ranging from chicken to vegetarian, but in my opinion the pork is really the best. This location sometimes will give you a discount if you order just meat/cheese/rice and sometimes not...it's rather bizarre, but I think it depends on if the manager is around or not. I keep my receipts as a rather amusing record of how many times I have gotten the \"Ilini secret special.\"It's quite expensive as \"fast food\" goes and it gets crowded. I usually take mine to go, since every Chipotle I've visited has had a harried atmosphere that makes dining in unpleasant...but even if it upscale fast food, it's still fast food, so that's what I expect.", 
      "Chipotle is delicious. \u00a0Way better and fresher than qdoba, but they also don't have as much variety (I'd go for fresher and better over variety any day). \u00a0Burritos run about $6.50-$7, plus you can go for the upsell with guac, chips, and a drink and end up with a ~$12 bill, which is a little much for a meal in a fast casual restaurant. \u00a0The burritos are pretty big, but I can't say that I'm completely full after them, however with the calorie count, I really shouldn't complain. \u00a0Biggest downside to this location is that it's almost always busy; you can expect a 10-30 minute wait during lunch and dinner periods, and sometimes just randomly throughout the day. \u00a0Also, they aren't open all that late, so you can't satisfy those late night munchies with a Chipotle burrito :-(", 
      "I really don't understand all the guilt in liking Chipotle! If you like it, you like it. Frankly I'd take a tasty inauthentic chain restaurant burrito over some of the local flavorless grease bombs any day. I think the success of Chipotle is down to their very focused menu. They only serve burritos, salads and chips. They have chosen a narrow scope and do it well.Like most chain restaurants, it usually tastes better the when they are busier. I have gone at off-times and had less-than fresh ingredients served to me. Frankly though if they start scraping the bottom of the container of meat I imagine you could politely ask to wait for a fresh batch.I'm not a fan of grease and I enjoy the fact that the meat seems lean but juicy. That way grease isn't squirting all over your plate as you attempt to eat the burrito. Their chips are generally very fresh tasting and warm. They have just the right amount of salt. I'd recommend the guacamole as it's certainly better than I ever imagined it could be.There are better sit-down restaurants to eat Mexican in town. But if you need something quick to eat and are near campus this is a great choice over somewhere like Taco Bell.", 
      "It's a Chipotle. So the food is what you'd expect from any other Chipotle. Don't go at lunch or dinner time because the line winds around the eating area.", 
      "Service is quick and friendly. I like the two stories with the building. Things are a little bit more quiet upstairs. Their Chips and salsa are addicting. Simply put. mmmmm Tacos. . .", 
      "Visited here for the first time a few days ago. I've been to Qdoba many times over the years, but had always avoided Chipotle due to the much longer waits. \u00a0I generally avoid campus eateries when students are here, but since it was much less crowded on campus a friend of mine and I decided to take advantage.I wanted to get a chicken burrito (as did my friend), but we were told it would be at least an additional 5 minute wait, so my friend chose steak and I decided to try the carnitas. \u00a0I was expecting something very flavorful, but I felt it was rather bland. I chose black beans, medium salsa (wish I had gone with hot now, because medium had no heat or taste at all), and cheese. \u00a0Perhaps it would have been better with chicken, but I would have taken a steak queso burrito from Qdoba any day. \u00a0I will probably give it another chance if I have the urge to go on campus, but the hype I had heard before going outweighed my actual experience. \u00a0Extremely loud, but you kinda expect that on campus.", 
      "Why the fuck would I review Chipotle, a delicious but slightly generic burrito chain? I had to echo the chorus whom can't help but laugh at the portion sizes. Of course some may say we're just being \"Fat Americans,\" but I love the bang-for-my-buck gut bombs that Chipotle is famous for. The burritos at this location simply seem like a sample size compared to superior other locations; the employees seem to give less of \u00a0a damn than any other fast food location in the area. That's a great summation of this Chipotle.", 
      "Gimme a break, this is an imitation Mexican restaurant run by McDonalds. \u00a0I'm from Urbana and I live in a very competitive place for mexican food, San Diego, CA. \u00a0The best thing that can be said about the food is, (a) Its not expensive for the amount you get, (b) It's unlikely to cause indigestion, and (c) If you've never tried mexican before, this won't turn you away forever.Otherwise, compared to many other mexican fast-food restaurants, this one is highly forgettable. \u00a0Example : L.S. (CA West Coast), much better, a 5-star fast-food mexican restaurant. \u00a0Example : R. (National), much better, a little pricier than the one above and salsas not as good, a 4-star fast-food mexican restaurant, and a publically traded company. \u00a0Example : T.B. (National). \u00a0Ok, it's not really mexican, but I enjoy their \"imaginary\" mexican creations, such as the 7-layer burrito and their chalupas, 3 stars.", 
      "Never understood why people love Chipotle so much. Regardless, it's a quick lunch spot with seating upstairs. I ordered the vegetarian bowl with guac and sour cream.", 
      "When I visited this Chipotle most recently, it was lunchtime and the staff seemed stressed. \u00a0There was a very large fax order and the crew was trying to get that order made, as well as tend to the long line of people. \u00a0I had to wait for a while, and even when I was first in line (and waiting for the fax burritos to be made) no one greeted me, or apologized for the delay. \u00a0They ignored the lengthening line as they made the fax order. When they were able to start my tacos, I noticed that all the food looked fine, really delicious, but I thought that the portion size of the meat was less than usual. \u00a0I eat at a Chipotle at least once a week, and most frequently I have been a customer of the West Lafayette, Indiana or Valparaiso, Indiana stores. \u00a0I used to live a half-block from the West Lafayette store, so for close to a year it was probably my favorite place to run out to eat. \u00a0So, I think I know what the portion size should look like. \u00a0I assumed that the workers were rushing and not being careful, so I spoke up and asked for the right portion size because what I was given looked \"short.\" The crew member got defensive and said that if I wanted more, I would be charged for double meat. \u00a0I didn't want, nor ask for, double meat, just the right or \"usual\" portion size. \u00a0He then said he had to ask his manager. \u00a0The manager agreed to give me slightly more (which was probably getting close to the right amount), which could have resolved the problem entirely if she had done so with a smile. \u00a0But instead, she had to \"be right\" and she verbally pointed out to me that the way my tacos had originally been served was correct and that I was wrong for saying it wasn't. \u00a0She even said something about the number of ounces it is supposed to be (but she didn't have any way to really measure this other than eyeballing it.)All I wanted was probably 25 or 50 cents of ingredients to make it right (and the ingredients I didn't select, like cheese and sour cream, would have made up the cost to the company, on the whole.) So instead of delighting me with a smile and a quick resolution to this issue, the manager made a choice to verbally argue with me (after I had waited a good 5-10 minutes in line), and leave me displeased with both the food and especially the customer service.Chipotle, you're supposed to leave the customer relaxed, happy, and satisfied -- not upset.", 
      "Please don't hate, but I like Chipotle... Sure it's owned by McDonalds, sure it's not authentic Mexican food, but still it's very tasty. Nothing special about this particular location: it looks like any other Chipotle restaurant (maybe a little nicer?). The nice thing about it, though, is that I get the same burrito that I would buy in NYC for $2 cheaper...", 
      "I don't like burritos but I love Chipotle! Yes, it's fast food but I think what makes them different is their ingredients. They grill their meat to perfection, make their buttered rice from scratch and their salsas are amazing! I would easily choose Chipotle over La Bamba's anytime.", 
      "Recently, the prices at this location have arbitrarily climbed (while the prices at other locations have remained static), and customer service has significantly decreased. The burritos, which were already smaller than usual at this location, have shrunk an inconceivable amount (I now get only about half a scoop of meat compared with an ample scoop and a half at other locations), significantly reducing my satisfaction as a customer. I e-mailed Chipotle directly with my concerns and received a copy and paste response almost two weeks after my complaint. Way to go!", 
      "I love Chipotle and lived in a town without one for a couple years. I was really excited to move to Champaign and finally be able to have Chipotle once a week for lunch again but this location just sucks. The employees are rude and move so slow. They give really skimpy portion sizes. The guac, rice, and tea taste different than all the others I've eaten at. This location goes against everything Chipotle stands for. It's such a shame.", 
      "Chipotle is the best. We all know it. But the thing is, this Chipotle could run a lot more efficiently. There is a lot of time waiting in line because the efficiency of getting more food on the line isn't as fast as it should be, especially for a fast-food chain 2 blocks away from campus. Why still four stars? Because it's delicious! I still go here all the time because the food is so fresh-- it must get replaced very frequently because of the amount of people that go here, so it's in its freshest state. All in all, good place, but could use some better efficiency.", 
      "Awesome like always!!!! Great healthy food!", 
      "It's Chipotle. It fulfills a need--satisfying my cravings for psuedo-Mexican food. I do actually think their guac is really good, and the unique char on the chicken is what keeps me coming back. Of course there are better choices for Mexican, but how can you deny that specific craving?", 
      "I'm giving Chipotle a 2 only to differentiate them from Qdoba, which is definitely worse, but in a just world this would be a 1.5. The food is only nominally Mexican, meat is dry and not so flavorful, prices not all that reasonable, and the salsa tasteless. There's really no reason to go to either Qdoba or Chipotle with La Bamba and (even better) Los Amigos around.", 
      "Its a Chipotle, so there isn't much to elaborate on. \u00a0Don't go from noon to 1pm when school is in session, as the line can get ridiculous. \u00a0But otherwise I've never had a bad experience at this location.", 
      "My first time Chipotle was sometime last year. It was one of the best things, and I fell in love with Chipotle. The service is fast and the food is great. I love their chicken tacos and burrito bowls and they have tons of other great choices. If you love Mexican food, I would definitely suggest trying \u00a0it out!!", 
      "mmmm....I love the Burrito Bowl....I think you get more for your money. \u00a0They have their signature Rice with Lime & Cilantro now with Brown Rice. \u00a0And I love the Guacomole....Mmmmm.", 
      "There is NEVER a good reason to go to Chipotle. \u00a0Even the worst non-Chipotle Mexican food in town is better than this place.", 
      "This Mexican restaurant is not exactly fantastic but it could be the only choice you have if you like some Tabasco sauce on your lunch. Price wise, it is not cheap: a little below $8 dollars for a bowl of rice, your choice of mild to hot salsa, lettuce and beans with your choice of beef or chicken. The line is topically long if you show up around noon. They are fast in scooping your food once you get to the food counter though, I give them that.", 
      "It's a hit or miss chipotle. I love chipotle, but this place you need to get lucky with the person preparing your order. The amount they give you isn't measured so it will always be different. The actual quality of ingredients though is somewhat worse compared to other chipotles I have been to. Since it's the only close one in champaign, it'll have to do.", 
      "For some reason, I am hungry 2 hours after eating at Chipotle. \u00a0My friends say it is because I order the vegetarian crispy tacos instead of the burrito. \u00a0However, an 800 calorie meal shouldn't do that! \u00a0Nevertheless, the tacos are delicious! \u00a0They are messy!", 
      "Always get the fajita burrito with extra rice. My chipotle experiances have always been great except for this chipotle. The service is not super friendly, and when then put the meat on your burrito, they don't put alot. There is always a long line, which is usually acceptable except when the line has to fold into the eating area. This chipotles burritos are usally 3/4 the size of the ones i get made for me at other chipotle places. Still this chipotle is able to fix my chipotle fix."

      "My wife and I stopped here on our way back to Chicago. The food was all very good and reasonably priced! Everything tasted freshly prepared and full of flavor. They also have outdoor seating which is a huge plus. I'd highly recommend this place for a casual get-together or a date night.", 
      "The meal started with the coconut crusted shrimp and orange jalapeno dipping sauce. \u00a0The shrimp was well prepared but the sauce was somewhat bland and oily - very oily. \u00a0For the entree, I had the chicken mole. \u00a0The waiter described the mole precisely which was excellent since it was the sole reason for choosing it. \u00a0However, the sauce was poured over a very small half chicken with skin and bones resulting in little meat and lots of picking through the skin and bones to find said meat. \u00a0The fresh squeezed limeade could have used more lime juice.The restaurant itself is comfortable and inviting. \u00a0Service was excellent.", 
      "Consistently, I have always had very good food here. Recently, we ate at the bar. \u00a0Hopefully, the owner or management will read this... THE LIGHTING IS HORRIBLE!I've been in the hospitality business for over 35 years and I am a major \"Foody\". \u00a0Three things that can spoil my dining experience is bad food, bad service, and bad atmosphere/lighting. \u00a0At Escobar, the food and service is good and the atmosphere in the dining room is decent. \u00a0But the bar... I couldn't wait to leave. I experienced the very same thing at the sister restaurant Milos where the entire restaurant has horrible lighting. \u00a0The food and service was wonderful, but because of the atmosphere/lighting, I never wanted to return.", 
      "Seriously, what's so fancy about this place when the food and the atmosphere doesn't reflect anything close to fine-dining. I have eaten million times in fine-dining places from L.A. to Europe and this is DEFINITELY NOT the place to experience delicious fine dining. However the prices and portions does fit to the fine-dining definition unlike the taste, service and atmosphere.", 
      "I went here for my birthday and holy crap, amazing food. Where has this place been hiding? The drinks were great, but the seafood paella was awesome. Perfectly cooked scallops. They were so tender and sweet, I could have eaten twenty. All of our food was great.", 
      "Meun is interesting, food is delicious. \u00a0All 4 of us very much enjoyed our meals. The only issue we had was service; it seemed like they were understaffed (maybe a few servers called in?) and though our server did ok, it was slower than expected. Bottom line, one of the best restaurants in Champaign and I'm excited to return!", 
      "Good food -- a bit pricey for the portion sizes but all prepared well. Meat dishes like the Hanger Steak Asada and osso bucco contained tasty prepared meat that was very tender to the fork and deliciously prepared vegetables and potato on the side. The seafood dishes like the sauteed shrimp and scallops and seafood paella also contained nice large juicy pieces of seafood, although only a few pieces. The rice on the paella as surprisingly flavorful although a little wet. The crema catalana I tried was also prepared very nicely with a crunchy caramelized sugar top over tasty custard that wasn't too thick and tempered with just the right amount of citrus. Overall, the food texture, temperature, and flavor was great -- however the small portion sizes for the price make me hesitant to award the final star.", 
      "Awesome menu and always delicious fresh food! Only real complaint is that their hours can be tricky to remember, \u00a0especially on weekends. \u00a0Could be an amazing brunch spot.", 
      "So torn...Food + D\u00e9cor = 5Service = 1Attitude = 1D\u00e9cor was quaint & created a warm/relaxing atmosphere. Food was delicious & consisted of many local ingredients. Coffee (also local) is memorable. I ordered the Guatemalan Torta: eggs, ham, black bean spread, and Monterey Jack cheese on Cuban Bread $9 and my brother had the Guatemalan breakfast: Two fried eggs with black bean sauce, sour cream, fried plantains and tortillas $9. Portions were large, fresh, and appetizing - the torta bread was soft and chewy = awesome; the other ingredients worked well together (ex. saltiness of the cheese + sweetness of the ham). Bonus: I was able to have half of it as leftover lunch today which tasted just as good and wished I had a cup of their coffee to accompany it. The Guatemalan breakfast is a version of the torta deconstructed and my brother's favorite part was the plantains.Operations/management aspect was a mess & unwelcoming. There was a sign that stated \"wait to be seated\" but that only works if you actually have someone seating people. After waiting for what seemed like an eternity a server appeared moving at snail pace. Coffee came in a cup the size of an airplane coffee cup because they ran out of regular mugs. No one stopped by after food came to the table to check how our food was or refill coffee. I was finally able to locate a server by the time I was close to being finished for a coffee refill, box, & check. Management was unprepared/understaffed to say the least but the alarming part is that they didn't seem to care or wish to be there themselves and it felt like we were intruding. I'm hoping we were secretly on an episode of Punk'd because that delicious meal took too much effort. \u00a0Great concept, terrible execution.", 
      "Love this place! \u00a0The food is awesome. \u00a0Only complaint is that the \"roll of the day\" rarely lives up to the expectations set by my first visit.", 
      "Actually awesome. My friend and I shared the mushroom enchiladas and paella, so we could get a taste of each. I was nervous about the seafood in the paella not being fresh, but I was wrong. It tasted great, not fishy at all. The mushroom enchiladas were good, nothing special but still quite tasty. The service was nice, too. For a college kid, yeah this is a bit pricey, but go here on a date, for a special occasion, or with your parentals! Loved it.", 
      "Not worth the money! Drinks $8 and not good and very small. Chips that were served with the guacamole were very greasy. Pear salad and pear not ripe. Pork chop under cooked. After telling waitress the above, she didn't offer any suggestions to rectify. Very disappointing!", 
      "Had dinner here on a Friday night, and it wasn't too busy. I know there have been several comments about the service, but I felt like my server Tyler was really attentive. The hostess was MIA when we came in so we stood around for a while waiting, even though there were several empty tables. She came up finally and just said 'have a reservation?' I thought immediately: is this Champaign or Chicago ?! The food was ok, I agree 100% with a previous review saying the seafood paella was not a paella- this is correct. It's more of a risotto with seafood on top, which was not seasoned that much to be honest. It was decent, but it was not paella. I had the calamari for an appetizer and it was good, although the way it was prepared was reminiscent of fish sticks. I had the Escobar's Punch as a cocktail and it was good.I would definitely come back, I liked the atmosphere/ambiance. I had a good server but it seems like they still have some overall service issues to work out.", 
      "The saving grace for Escobar's is the decor/ambiance and the quality of food, but I would not go back given the poor service. \u00a0My boyfriend and I went here for our belated Valentine's Day dinner on Saturday and I had never been there before. \u00a0When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised with the warmness of the decor. \u00a0It was very cute.However, when we were seated, it took a very long time for our waiter to get to us. \u00a0The busboy also kind of tossed/threw the bread bowl on the table which was weird and definitely made me raise an eyebrow.We ordered the guacamole appetizer and a caesar salad to start; my boyfriend ordered the hanger steak and I got the mushroom enchilada. \u00a0The guacamole was pretty good and both of us really enjoyed our entrees. \u00a0However, the salad failed to come and our waiter only noticed it once he brought over the entrees. \u00a0We still got the salad but it was pretty bland and unexciting, despite the enticing description on the menu.The worst part of the evening was the service. \u00a0Even though our food was good, we could never find the waiter to refill our water or order dessert. \u00a0He took so long we ended up deciding not to get dessert at all. \u00a0Even though the interior of the restaurant is cute, I would not go back. \u00a0Compared to other places in Chambana, the prices are high and I can also get really good food elsewhere.", 
      "While the owners may be Guatemalan, Escobar is a swanky pan-Latino flavor fiesta. \u00a0It's on the higher end of the restaurants for Chambana, and it's nicely done without being too overdone. \u00a0I ordered the tilapia, which came in a delicious mixed sauce with sauteed vegetables. \u00a0YES. \u00a0'Twas wondrous.After a great time chatting with fellow graduate students, professors, and a prospective student, it came time for dessert. \u00a0And they had bananas flambe. \u00a0Now two of my favourite things in life are desserts and unnecessary applications of fire. \u00a0And this bananas flambe was absolutely marvelous. \u00a0I was filled with happiness. \u00a0And BANANAS.All in all, the service was extraordinarily friendly, the food was well-plated, nicely prepared, and delicious; and the ambiance was pitch perfect. \u00a0NICE.", 
      "I really needed to break out and try a new restaurant in Champaign. \u00a0We are here for football weekends and usually go to the same couple of spots. \u00a0I was down visiting my daughter and she chose a winner!Escobar's has a very inventive menu with a fusion of many latin tastes with its own Ol\u00e9 added to the mixture. \u00a0We had the fried calamari for our app, something I would not expect in a Latin restaurant but it was delicious with one heck of a tasty sauce. \u00a0I had the Cuban sandwich for my main course and it was crunchy with all the distinct flavors you expect in a Cuban sandwich but with their own version of it.My favorite two beverages in the world are freshly brewed iced tea and bottled Mexican coke and they had both. \u00a0Hard choices that are great either way are part of what makes this such a great place.It's more expensive than your typical Mexican restaurant because it is so much more and quite frankly, aren't you worth it?", 
      "I'm with Pete B. -- doesn't live up to the hype.My parents took us to Escobar's as part of their \"see - Champaign has just as good dining as your neck of the woods... promise!!\" dining tour. \u00a0This was near the top of their list of must-go's.The food was good, but not great, and certainly not amazing. \u00a0At our table, we had:- Hanger steak asada - Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin (got the best reviews, but they still weren't enthusiastic)- Sesame-crusted salmon- Saut\u00e9ed shrimp and scallopsThe service was fine, though we were kept waiting for our food for a LONG time. \u00a0Plus, all entr\u00e9es but one came out at the same time, and it took more than five minutes for the last to show up. \u00a0I hate when they do that... everyone who has their food wants to eat it but feels they need to wait, and the one person who doesn't have their food is left feeling guilty and telling everyone to start. \u00a0No thanks.Also worth noting:18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more, \"for our convenience. \" Really? \u00a0I've never seen this for under 6, and usually under 8. \u00a0This is so they're more sure to get a good-ish tip because they're planning on the party being difficult because of its size. \u00a05 people is not difficult, suck it up.$4 Split plate charge. \u00a0Really? \u00a0This is not a hoity-toity enough place to pull this off, even in Champaign. \u00a0Thanks for putting it on the menu, though, instead of trying to sneak it in... at least you're broadcasting your shortcomings.-Overall, given the weird choices they make, the good-but-not-great food, balanced with the meal prices (most hovering in the $20 entr\u00e9e range), it's solidly a two-star experience. \u00a0I wouldn't return.", 
      "I was a little disappointed with the food at Escobar's. The place was recommended to me by a friend as being one of the better restaurants in Champaign, and the menu online looked interesting, so I decided to give it a try for dinner. The restaurant is really big and was pretty empty when I went (around 8pm on a Tuesday night). After pigging out on the complimentary bread and drinking a mango margarita (tasty if a bit too sweet maybe), I started with an appetizer of fried calamari. I should better than to order seafood in the middle of Illinois: it was certainly not terrible, but it wasn't great either... a letdown for the calamari lover that I am. I then ordered the duck breast: the duck itself was not very good (not very tender and slightly overcooked), and it came with steamed vegetables (boring), mashed sweet potatoes (not bad but a little plain), fried plantain chips (good), and roasted pears (definitely the highlight of the dish: these were actually quite delicious). Overall... not a terrible entree but still quite disappointing and a little overpriced. To their defense, the portions were very large and I was completely stuffed by the time I left the restaurant. Friendly service.", 
      "Escobar's might be the best restaurant in Champaign. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. The wait staff has always been pleasant and attentive. And the food is almost always impressive. I'll acknowledge other reviewers who gripe about the time it can take to receive your food. Going to a fine restaurant should be an event, not something you rush through. It's an experience. I've never found a meal here to take longer than similar fine restaurants. A typical meal at Escobar's might last roughly 70 - 90 minutes if you get an appetizer, entree and dessert. Not unreasonable at all, but maybe a little longer than a meal at Chili's, for instance. ;-)As for the food, you'll be served a small basket of assorted breads once seated. These are always fresh, delicious and unique. Some sweet, some savory. I never know what kinds we'll get, and I always get a little bit excited to see what will be in there. Please excuse my nerdiness. Below is a rundown of some of the dishes I've had at Escobar's. Appetizers: Coconut crusted shrimp - fantastic. The shrimp are enormous and perfectly fried. Served with a delicious orange-jalapeno dipping sauce.Duck confit taquitos - a taste sensation, but at $10 for just 2 taquitos, it's a bit of a splurge. Almost an amuse-bouche than a true appetizer. If there were 4 in an order, getting this would be a no-brainer every time. House made guacamole - a huge portion of freshly-made guacamole, served with a heaping pile of warm, roasted tortilla chips. This is a favorite when I come here. Entrees:Filet mignon and andouille sausage kebobs - my new favorite dish. I have never had such tender, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon in my life. The andouille sausage was a nice, spicy accompaniment. Huge portion. Absolutely delicious. Phyllo wrapped lamb loin - a bit overrated. The phyllo was a little burnt when I ordered this, and there wasn't much of a sauce. Crab cakes with guajillo cream sauce - O.M.G. The crab cakes are light, flaky, fresh, and this guajillo cream sauce - a bright orange sauce, takes this dish to a whole new level. Spicy, smokey - it's a heaping forkful of warm love going in your mouth every few seconds. Love. Sauteed shrimp and scallops - a forgettable, bland dish - and the scallops were gritty (my worst nightmare whenever eating scallops). One of the few disappointments I had when dining here. They do have a small dessert menu. Mango rum cheesecake, lemon curd pie with berries, flan (I never knew I liked flan until I tried it here!). Dessert portions aren't too big, nor too small. The perfect way to end a fantastic meal. Again, service has always been friendly and attentive. Once, we were not waited on for about 10 minutes after being seated. When our waitress realized her mistake, she offered us free soup to make up for it, and gave us excellent service during the rest of our meal. She went out of her way to make it up to us, and we appreciated her enthusiasm. One of my favorite restaurants in the C-U area!", 
      "Fabulous wine list.Fresh ingredients.Talented Chef.Great Staff.The best and fresh fish! (for Champaign! hell yeah!)My favorites:Fried Calamari with aioli.Seared Salmon with fried rice and wasabi cream sauce.Lamb with couscous and rosemary goat cheese sauce.the PAPUSA!! YES!New York Strip Steak...cooked perfectly.Obdulio's ribs...OMGThe flourless chocolate cake with chilis and cinnamon...which I try to make at home and am getting closer and closer everyday.Why are people so whinny and pissy? Get the stick out of your ass and eat good food :) Champaign is a growing palace of local ingredients and inventive restaurants. Go Champaign!", 
      "Wish I could give two different star ratings.Would give 5 stars to the food and the bartender who greeted us and romantically described the specials. The scallop nachos were innovative;the phyllo-wrapped lamb was divine.Unfortunately our service turned frightening when the sweet bartender was shunned to the dishroom and a wicked witch took over the service. She was just plain mean when she delivered the works of culinary art to our tiny space at the bar, tossed dessert menus at us and rudely swiped the check out from under my arm. Granted it was 830 on a Thursday night in Champaign, but in the reality of niche restaurant management you can't treat guests this way and survive! Sorry Chef...you front of the house staff ruined a fabulous meal!", 
      "Consistently excellent. \u00a0This is probably the best restaurant in Champaign County right now for quality of food and preparation.The atmosphere is not wild, but the acoustics are great for a dinner conversation, the waitstaff is highly trained and professional, and the meals are works of art.Great wines and good ingredients are used to make for wonderfully delicious tastes.If you want to be sure that no one in your party is disappointed, this is the place to go. \u00a0I award it 5 stars because of service and presentation.Check out my photos for beauty of the entree plating.", 
      "Escobars delivers with good food and great drinks. Went there on a Saturday evening without a reservation and got a table for 2 outside right at 7pm. Usually we order wine or beer, but this time got our mixed drink on. She had a super strong sangria that was good once you had a couple of sips and I had a Capirinha (sp?), which tastes like a Mojito w/o the mint, but with tequilla instead of rum (I know its not tequilla, but that is what it tastes like). Anyway, that was really strong, too but was not as tasty as their spicy Bloody Maria that followed.Service was spotty for us. Our server probably should not have been assigned our table, as she was busy with a private party in a special room they have. She did not make it up to us in the al fresco dining section as much as I would have liked. However, she made up for it with a comp on the Bloody Maria, so its all good in this hood.The food was great. We had an app of their stuffed pupusas, a great vegetarian dish that is bready goodness just bursting with latin flavors. I had the enchiladas and she had the pork tenderloin. Both were fantastic and big enough for lunches the day after. Since we were on bikes, they were able to wrap the dishes up extra careful for my backpack, and they made the trip back to Urbana no worse for the wear.BTW- There was an obnoxious 40-something biatch next to us getting all nasty with her server about the (extremely moderate) amount of spice in the food. Its not too spicy. If you are think Escobar's is too spicy, then you will never know the joys you are depriving yourself.", 
      "This place has really good lunch options, with the empanadas being my favorite. The bread that they apparently make in-house is also delicious.Dinners, not so much. The first and last time we came during dinner time, three out of three people were unhappy with their items. This is one-third due to the fact that desirable vegetarian options are few and far between. My friend ended up with a cup of chili. My husband had an open-face tamale that was on special. He was confounded by texture and taste. I had a lamb dish that was probably $8 more expensive than it needed to be. Our server was also not that spectacular.I get that it is very exciting to have \"fine dining\" in Champaign, other than Radio Maria. But, I am not sure that it is fair to say that just because such places exist mean that they deserve five stars, or even four stars. Honestly, I would give it three stars but I take serious issue with how management perceives customer service. Consequently, I will likely never come back here.", 
      "One of the better restaurants in Chambana. \u00a0A cozy, open dinning area with a small bar. \u00a0Warm colors, bright and airy. \u00a0A very comfortable feel. \u00a0Service is attentive and knowledgeable. \u00a0The food here is very fresh, and the kind of Latin American/Mexican that I wish more places would make.Appetizers are great. \u00a0Ceviche is fresh as can be, and I love the Duck Confit taquitos. \u00a0Main dishes are large, filling, and always fresh as well. \u00a0Their seafood is great. \u00a0Tilapia and salmon are cooked perfectly. \u00a0Wild mushroom enchilada is awesome. \u00a0They have some sandwiches for lunch that are great. \u00a0Tacos for early bird dinner, great. \u00a0You will not find mounds of gelatinous refried beans and crappy rice that come from a can or bag here. \u00a0You can taste the fresh flavors. \u00a0A great mix of Latin America and Mexican. \u00a0They also have a half way decent beer selection in bottles. \u00a0I usually enjoy some Founders. \u00a0A well stocked bar, and good mixed drinks. \u00a0I keep saying this, but it is true. \u00a0A great spot with fresh and well prepared food. \u00a0One of my favorite spots in Champaign/Urbana.", 
      "I was here with a group of about 12 people tonight, and I think at some point independently each and every one of us said \"I can't believe this is in champaign,\" with an emphasis on \"I can't believe this is in champaign behind the neil street post office.\"For real. \u00a0This is the best food I've had in champaign. \u00a0My strip steak was a fantastic cut of meat, prepared perfectly. \u00a0I sampled almost everyone else's dish, and there was nothing that I couldn't have eaten a whole plate of. \u00a0Duck Enchiladas, man.Hit it up now, before word gets out and it gets impossible to get in.", 
      "This was not the best meal I've ever had, but it was really great. \u00a0And, at the risk of sounding like a snobby jackass (which I suppose I am), it's probably one of the best fine dining experiences you can anticipate having in the middle of Illinois.Personally, I was really pleased with the nice wine selection. \u00a0I don't remember what we chose anymore (it was a red, though), but it was strong, complemented the food well, and was loaded with delicious, teeth-staining tannins. \u00a0Mmmm....moderately-priced wine...The food was definitely the best part. \u00a0It was artistically displayed and delicious. \u00a0I had southwestern crabcakes. \u00a0While they were good, the red skin mashed potatoes were even better. \u00a0I savored them until the very end. \u00a0Mmmm-mm. \u00a0The Boy had \"sauteed shrimp and scallops with lime butter and cilantro-pepita pesto over ziti pasta.\" \u00a0This was also delectable. \u00a0Oh yeah! \u00a0And we had an appetizer of \"coconut-crusted shrimp with mango jalapeno relish.\" \u00a0SO good. \u00a0The shrimp were of the \"super-mega-huge\"-variety, the relish was to die for (I could eat it all the time), and there was some awesome dipping sauce that they don't mention, but should.The weird bits were in the service. \u00a0A waitress came over, introduced herself like, \"Hi, my name is ____, I'll be taking care of you tonight. \u00a0Do you know what you would like to drink? \u00a0Okay, I'll be right back with that wine for you,\" and then never came back. \u00a0We saw her go out to her car and drive away. \u00a0Someone else took over for her, but it took awhile and the personnel-swap was never mentioned. \u00a0Secondly, we were only one of two parties when we showed up. \u00a0By the time we left, there were three other tables that were literally seated all around us. \u00a0The restaurant is spacious enough to spread four tables of people out instead of cramming everyone in a small area. \u00a0I wouldn't have minded, but it was an anniversary dinner for us, and it kind of killed the ambience. \u00a0Oh well. \u00a0It was still nice.", 
      "I wish this place had more vegetarian entrees. This being said they do have amazing food. Their guacamole is to die for and their desserts are the bomb. Also, their bathrooms are pimp.", 
      "Wonderful Champaign Restaurant. \u00a0We went with a group of 9, and it was delightful. \u00a0The wait staff was attentive, but not over crowding; the guac was absolutely delicious and the portion was very large. \u00a0I had a Spanish rioja, which made me very happy as well, libation wise.For dinner I had the phyllo and chevre wrapped lamb; the lamb was a little more cooked than I wanted with a medium rare order, but it was still delicious; the chevre/rosemary/phyllo was an awesome, melt in your mouth combination. \u00a0Veggies were good, mashes potatoes were awesome as well.Overall, I really liked Escobar; great food, we had great company, and a wonderful celebration to finishing theses :) \u00a0Definitely a Champaign gem!", 
      "Best restaurant in Champaign. The lamb, salmon and lobster dishes are so delicious.", 
      "MMM MMM Great. \u00a0High-end Latin food that makes you think your in Chicago its so good, but not the city pricing. \u00a0The menu is high brow, and smart, but the look is casual. \u00a0It's a treat that you can get food this good, but wear jeans!I have only eaten there a few times (okay, more then a few because I hate to cook) and the staff has remembered me from day 2. \u00a0In a town with a LOT of restaurants, this is a huge stand out. \u00a0Why go eat crap on North Prospect when you can go here!", 
      "3.5 starsFor such a highly-rated restaurant on yelp, I was disappointed.We made a reservation for graduation Sunday at 8:30 pm. I called back a week before we went to make sure they didn't screw up our reservation. They assured me that the reservation was still there.Well, it wasn't. They screwed up our reservation, and we had to wait till 9:10 pm to be seated. The group ahead of us, who DIDN'T make a reservation, got a table before us. I asked if there's a point at all to make a reservation, and the owner stuttered. The owner then attempted to seat 5 of us at a small table meant for 4 at most which I thought was a little ridiculous. Being a server myself, I could've found a better spot ESPECIALLY when there's an empty 2-person table that could easily be joined to my table. FYI, the place was busy, but it was NOT packed since it's 8:30 pm on a Sunday night. The also had a special graduation menu which is almost identical to the regular menu but pricier. Food was good, but not great. We got 2 appetizers and 5 dishes, and we all sampled each other's. I liked the duck and the tilapia entree the most. I don't think anyone liked the chicken with mole sauce at all, but at least it was tenderly cooked. I got the red sangria which I didn't really like, but my dad did.This place didn't blow me away like I hoped it would. I've had better food in Champaign.", 
      "So, so, sooo goooood. I have never had a bad meal here. I've lived in Austin for 5 years now, but every time I come home for Christmas, I have to eat here at least once. My favorite is a shrimp and scallop lemon cream sauce dish. The merlot braised short ribs are also pretty awesome. Their white sangria is pretty tasty but maybe even a bit too sweet for my tastes. This place is a bit more expensive than your standard restaurant in Champaign, but it is definitely worth it, if only for a treat every now and then. This place has excellent food and the amount is usually more than I can eat in one meal anyway. I love the way the inside is decorated - it feels very festive without being too obtrusive.Also, Escobars is just fun to say.", 
      "A very nice treat after special events. \u00a0 The graduate enjoyed prime rib and Mexican chocolate cake. He said it was \"two thumbs up.\". \u00a0A couple of the ladies ordered tilapia with a chili sauce on one side and a honey sauce on the other. It was superb!My pork tenderloin was a bit overcooked but it was still very good.Overall - well worth a visit. \u00a0And the owner and staff was very friendly!", 
      "Ma\u00eetre d' \u00a0gratuitously, breathtakingly rude as we walked in. I gave him a chance to simply apologize and he used it to justify his rudeness. Full disclosure: I didn't know whether we'd have 5 or 7 guests (it's ebertfest). Fact is I wasn't rude to him: he treated me like he thought I was an idiot. A basic principle of good resto services is to avoid gratuitous meanness, even during ebertfest. I'm a local, love their food and won't go back. People deserve to be treated with basic civility, esp when they are civil to you. The second waiter's apology later sounded a bit more genuine, but not enough. Goodbye Escobar's. I hardly knew you, but I'm not coming back, and I'll be telling my friends. I recommend not going.", 
      "My mom, sister, husband and I went to Escobar's for my sister's birthday -- it was a Sunday so we had brunch. \u00a0The restaurant was cute -- nicely decorated and comfortable. \u00a0The waiter was very personable and helpful with suggestions and descriptions of dishes. \u00a0I started with a limeade, and my mom and sister had coffee -- a fantastic blend developed at the Columbia Street Roastery (which is next door). \u00a0We were served cornbread with orange zest mixed into the batter. \u00a0It was a little bit sweet for my taste (but I tend to prefer more savory cornbread in general). \u00a0We ordered platanos fritos, which were subtly spiced with cinnamon, and served with black beans on the side -- they went together surprisingly well.For brunch, I ordered the California Benedict -- avocado, asparagus, and a poached egg atop an english muffin, covered with a chile-spiced hollandaise sauce. \u00a0It was quite good -- I thought the little zip in the sauce complimented the eggs nicely, and helped to engage the palate more. \u00a0I was told that the crab cake sandwich and the salad with egg were delicious as well. \u00a0All told, we had a great meal -- the only complaint I have was that they did not serve all of the entrees at the same time (although the delay was not long, it did serve to make the eggs Benedict a little lukewarm by the time we all started eating).Anyway, to sum up, the atmosphere was nice, the prices reasonable, the service generally good (and always pleasant), and the food delicious -- I will definitely return here when I come to Champaign again!", 
      "Disappointing food for the high cost.The ceviche ($10) does not come with raw fish cooked with the acids of a fresh lemon, but rather it is canned, cooked fish sitting in bottled lemon juice. The duck taquitos were dry, like frozen ones that were microwaved a little too long. (And they still sold for around $10 for two taquitos.) And the seafood in the paella ($21) was overcooked, and in a sauce that tasted a lot like Chef Boyardee sauce.My colleagues enjoyed the fish filet dishes, though, so perhaps it may be best to just avoid the dishes mentioned above.Besides that, friendly service and a good beer selection.", 
      "Awesome. Actually, half of the owner team is Guatemalan. They also own Milo's in bufu, Urbana but as Escobar is the chef, Escobar's is his place.I always have a good time with their wine staff, especially the lovely salty gal that has only been tending a short while but swigs wine like a sailor, which is to say she doesn't take a dainty white-glove approach. She's a no-nonsense, straight-up pro that can take in a mouthful of wine and nail the flavor notes without all the swirling and sniffing and sloshing. It's the only time I've been able to say, \"this one tastes like a chewy, sweaty S&M jock strap\" and have someone know exactly what I mean without further explanation. And despite the fact that she's a beer girl, her vino recommendations (granted the list is not as extensive as other places downtown) are excellent.I've done a few different things on the menu but I always go back to their duck a l'orange. The meat is always cooked to succulent perfection and maybe it's because everything on the plate is a shade of orange but the entire dish tastes juicy, earthy, bright and warm. Like 6pm sunshine! Like it's made from Care Bears! I want to liquify it, put it in an IV and jack the whole tasty lot right into my veins!The mussels are excellent as well and my friend scarfed the ceviche on our last visit (I had my face in the mussels - so much for sharing).The bread is baked in house and they have a bombin' spicy corn focaccia so it's easy to load up on table bread guilt-free because you can't nosh on Escobar bread anywhere else but Escobar's.Most importantly I like this place because the food is so good and the staff is so nice that it doesn't need all the flash and glam of other restaurants to earn five stars on yelp! The closest comparison I have is the cluster of restaurants out in Napa: sun-drenched, family-owned, friendly and in an epic love affair with food. Outdoor seating means gazing into a parking lot as cars zoom by but it is still the only place in Champaign where I am a little saddened at the end of my meal because I don't have four stomachs, four wads of cash and four hours to sit and eat four more servings of Escobar's duck a l'orange.", 
      "I must admit it is taking a little while for this place to grow on me but mainly because I like simple food without all of the frou-frou fanfare. \u00a0But I thought it worth mentioning that I had a fantastic hangar steak and garlic mashed potatoes there recently. \u00a0Very simple, just meat and potatoes. \u00a0It was great.And the restaurants is very nice inside as well, we like the bar area.", 
      "I love this place. \u00a0The decor is cozy and warm, with unique items that give it an ethnic feel. \u00a0I have only been here for lunches. \u00a0My favorite is the grilled chicken sandwich. \u00a0It comes with avocado, cheese, sweet potato fries, and a small but sufficient green salad. \u00a0They also serve warm muffins to eat while you wait for your food. \u00a0I love the cornbread muffins with a touch of butter--mmmm. \u00a0I also really like their fish tacos.I've had various servers and they have all been friendly, without being too eager for tips. \u00a0This has a genuineness to it that I keep coming back for."

Maybe it's the location, but this place should be jampacked with yuppies with elitist tastebuds and students looking for a foodie $$-saving deal. With the quality of the food here, you'd actually expect the service and dress to be a bit more uppity but surprisingly, it's casual and laidback (a good thing). The menu seems to be well-balanced; can't go horribly wrong with any choice.Foods I thought stood out: the Spanish rice (not too dry and nicely spiced) and the Mango-Rum cheesecake (a fluffy cheesecake! tricks you into thinking it's healthier? i'll succumb...).", 
      "This is definitely one of Champaign's nicer dining establishments. \u00a0I went in with a friend for lunch. \u00a0It was pretty empty in there, but it was sort of after the lunch rush and it was during the week. \u00a0We promptly were served ice cold water and some delicious banana bread muffins with butter for free. \u00a0I ordered a freshly squeezed limeade, a nice twist on lemonade. \u00a0My friend and I both agreed on getting the Cuban sandwich. \u00a0So many different flavors playing into this sandwich. \u00a0Sliced ham, a deliciously marinated shredded pork, Monterey-Jack cheese, pickles and a whole seed mustard topped off the sandwich served on baguette bread. \u00a0My friend commented on how he doesn't usually enjoy mustard but really enjoyed it on this sandwich. \u00a0The sandwich was accompanied by a side of mixed greens in a vinaigrette and some sweet potato fries. \u00a0Sweet potato fries are always an A+ in my book and the mixed greens were a good add too. \u00a0The fries and salad weren't anything to get super excited about, but definitely yummy and helped fill me up for sure. \u00a0Left there with a whole other half of my sandwich and one of the muffins. Lunch is extremely reasonably priced and although I understand it to be a little more expensive for dinner, I can't imagine being disappointed from what I saw from this meal.", 
      "They get points for presentation but that's pretty much where it ends. Service: Decent and attentive once we flagged someone down and asked to talk to someone about ordering! It took them about 5 minutes to get to that point.Appetizer: We had the morrocan-style mussels; probably the only well-seasoned dish of the night. Tasty, but not the best I've ever had.Entrees: The seafood paella is not a paella; its a bunch of seafood in a pot, with rice and sauce buried at the bottom. It was a beautiful presentation, and the seafood was cooked well but woefully underseasoned. None of the sauce touched the seafood, and the sauce was sub-par at best. It's Latin American food, right? Seasoning?!The phylo-wrapped lamb is an inventive dish, and beautifully presented. I think their chef went to beauty school, not culinary school. Again, underseasoned and the glaze seemed to be missing something...salt probably. Drinks: The mango margarita tasted like it was laced with lighter fluid or nailpolish remover. Their wine selection was really good.", 
      "WOW!!!!!!A great place for a fine dining evening. A couple friends and I went to Escobar's after reading some rave reviews. We entered the restaurant and the place was packed. It was about 6:30. We didn't have to wait long before they offered us a table in the bar room. The ambience was nice and the food was delicious.Our wait staff was a little slow and it took them a while to come around to refill our water and our bread basket, but the entree and overall experience made up for it.I ordered their white sangria. I must tell you that if you like sweet and fruity drinks, definitely order it it. It was so good that my friends decided to order it as their second drink.For our food, we decided to start off with the Coconut-crusted shrimp with orange-jalape\u00f1o dipping sauce. It was pretty good. The best part was the sauce.My entree, I ordered the Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin filled with goat cheese, rosemary, and coriander, served with red-skin mashed potatoes and port reduction. It it a mouthful to say and I must say that it is worth every word. The lamb was cooked perfectly and all the sides were very complimentary. I would definitely order this dish again.Overall, I give this place an A. I would definitely go back to try all the other dishes on their menu.", 
      "Dear Escobars Management -- If you are listening. . . I have been a loyal patron of your restaurant for years. You've been up and down, HOWEVER. . .  \u00a0 Yesterday I came in for brunch with visiting family on Easter, and our waitress was an embarrassment. \u00a0The food was good, but what strange service.  \u00a0 She was clearly on a diverse mix of prescription meds, because she had a hard time communicating with us. \u00a0The food was cold, because she brought it out one plate at a time for a group of 6, and proceeded to talk our face off as we were about to leave, despite being cold and indifferent during the rest of the meal. A little training might be in order here. Maybe you had the B-team on staff for Easter - but y'all need to check yourself before you wreck yourself.", 
      "This place is really hit or miss. The first time I came here, I had heard lots of good things about it, but the food was really mediocre. I returned a few years later and the food was awesome, one of the better restaurants in CU. Soon afterwards I came back again and the food was not so great. I'm not sure what's going on here but it's too bad they can't be more consistent.", 
      "AMAZING PLACE!!!!!! I love escobar... this is a right blend of amazing customer service with amazing food. I love Escobar, never disappointed me. I got the paella, so much delicious sea food. !!!!thank you Escobar for being so awesome!", 
      "Always tastes fresh, staff generally nice. The menu doesnt have that one gotta have it item as far as i am concerned but still plenty of good choices.", 
      "Stopped in for drink and an appetizer one evening. \u00a0We were greeted by a friendly (and beautiful) hostess. \u00a0Friendly seems a trait missing in most hostesses. \u00a0The great service continued with a friendly and efficient bartender, who can make a good martini (you'd think that was easy,it's not). \u00a0 We had the guacamole app and it was fantastic! \u00a0I will go back just for it.The atmosphere in the lounge area was calm and quiet (no tv's or rowdy people).Will go back for dinner soon.", 
      "Great choices that are well prepared. \u00a0I had the ceviche tonight followed by the pheasant and it was delicious. \u00a0Only complaint (and this is a bit snobbish) would be that there was a little much onion in the ceviche. \u00a0Besides that the wait was fairly long (25min) for my entree despite the restaurant being almost empty but I have to say it was definitely coming straight out of the oven and the preparation of my pheasant did not leave anything to be desired. \u00a0Solid 4 stars. \u00a0If I was back in town I would come here again.", 
      "Great food, great service.Made reservation for 14, including a toddler.Waitress handled our table with ease. Will for sure go back.", 
      "I wanted to like this place, really. I've been here twice. The first time, I ordered the duck dish, and I was underwhelmed by it. The second time, hoping I'd just had bad luck, I brought a group for my birthday. I had the lamb, which was OK, but not worth the price. One of my friends got a cocktail glass with lipstick still on it, and another friend's entree had a long hair in it. The waiter said that it didn't look like any of their kitchen staff's hair, which was almost worse. The owner came out to apologize, which was nice, but they didn't do anything beyond not charging my friend for the dish with the hair in it. That friend mentioned to the waiter that it was my birthday, and they didn't offer a dessert or anything else to me. I won't be back, and I don't think any of my friends will be, either.", 
      "What took me so long to try this place? I've passed by so many times and thought about it but I finally took the plunge. I'm so glad I did. It's a lovely location. It's nicely done but unpretentious. The wait staff was incredibly friendly. Refills were quick in coming and we got our food very quickly. As you waited you are served a basket of various tasty breads.We started with the coconut shrimp. It was absolutely delicious with huge, perfectly cooked shrimp covered in a tasty coating. The coating was very light and wasn't as sweet as some coconut shrimp can be (I think that was a plus) and it was served with a slightly spicy sauce and and a small bed of greens, onions and mango. The flavors were spot on. You only get four shrimp total but the shrimp are quite large and it was a good size portion for an appetizer.I had the chicken mol\u00e9 for my entree. Finally I have found a good mol\u00e9 in Champaign! I seriously had given up hope of finding a decent version of this sauce here, let alone an excellent version. I've tried just about ever mol\u00e9 sauce in town and it's almost universally bland with little more flavor than the sauce black beans are canned in. But this sauce had a great smokiness, a slight cinnamon undercurrent and the perfect amount of spice. It's served over two large pieces of chicken, still on the bone. The chicken was wonderfully cooked. The presentation was also a plus. It was served with Mexican rice, black beans, cooked fresh vegetables, \u00a0a fresh salsa and two large plantain chips all on a banana leaf-covered plate. The portion is nicely sized. Every element of this dish was superb. I really cannot find a fault with any of it and everything went so well together. The vegetables were even cut beautifully!My dining companion had the lamb dish and from the bite I had it was phenomenal as well. We finished off the night by sharing the chocolate-covered orange cake with raspberry cream. I would probably be a little afraid of how something like that might turn out if the meal I'd had wasn't so delicious. The desert did not disappoint.It's not a cheap place to eat dinner, although I took a look at their carry out lunch menu and they had some really great options all in the $10 - $11 range. And sometimes you really do get what you pay for.", 
      "Everything we had here was amazing, the chile relleno, chicken mole & sangria were all fantastic. \u00a0The waiters are very attentive and they never complained when we stayed almost 30 minutes past closing. \u00a0Yay!", 
      "This is a lovely, if noisy space, a beautiful rehab done on several contiguous buildings in the nascent loft district north of downtown. \u00a0Service here can be spotty, but I have been happy with the food for what it is. \u00a0It is not really what I would call Nuevo Latino or Latino fusion, such as a Cuatro in the South Loop in Chicago. \u00a0It is more Americanized, with some influences of Latino cuisine. \u00a0That said, I have had good steak and pork here, and the tres leches (three milk) cake is excellent. \u00a0I suggest eating in the bar area. \u00a0Quieter, full service, there are tables there as well.", 
      "Escobar's just opened a few months ago, and it's far enough off the beaten path that I imagine they're missing out on walk-in traffic. \u00a0I've only had brunch there, so I can't comment on the rest of the menu. \u00a0The brunch menu isn't too breakfast-y, but the options are tasty, and the portion sizes aren't ridiculous. \u00a0Our service the first time was excellent, and the second time, despite an almost empty dining room, our service was so-so. \u00a0The interior is gorgeous, especially the bathrooms. \u00a0I wish the menu changed more regularly, but they're new - this will improve in time.", 
      "Went Thursday night for a late dinner with my husband. \u00a0This was my first trip to escobar but middle son, who had been there before, refused to go because he claimed the atmosphere was too uninviting. \u00a0This was unusual for him to refuse to go out because he is a serious boy-about-town and never misses an opportunity to experience anything.OK, i'm sorry to say the aesthetic sensibilities of my 12 year old are a bit more fine tuned than whoever designed the interior of this restaurant. \u00a0It's all hard surfaces so the feel is very cold and extremely loud. \u00a0I asked my husband twice throughout the meal if he would be mad at me if I asked the people at the table next to us to stop laughing in such an annoying pitch. \u00a0Since he reminded me that i am not Larry David and nobody would find it funny, i refrained. \u00a0onto the food. \u00a0we had a spinach salad with mangos, shrimp, cucumbers, and red onions in a citrusy dressing. \u00a0this was good. \u00a0definitely fresh. \u00a0then we had a grouper over rice with veggies...eh, it was ok. \u00a0very large portions as in enough to feed 2 hungry adults, which worked well since we shared everything. \u00a0the fish was very fresh though so i give it 4 stars for that. \u00a0then we ordered coffee and bananas flambe. \u00a0the coffee had to be sent back because it was so weak and instead we ordered espressos. \u00a0i rarely ever send anything back probably because i hate wasting anything, but this was reeeeeeeeeeeeeally bad coffee. \u00a0Our waitress even agreed that she has to doctor her coffee when she drinks it here due to the weakness. \u00a0But the bananas and the caramel sauce...now that is worth 4 stars. \u00a0Would i go back? \u00a0No. \u00a0Should you try it? \u00a0Yes. \u00a0There seemed to be a lot of people there having a good time, laughing loudly.", 
      "Went to Escobar's last night for a celebration dinner for our daughter. \u00a0We shared the guacamole appetizer, I had spinach salad with mango Chile dressing, strawberries and candied walnuts and for my entree, mushroom ravioli with saffron cream sauce. \u00a0Daughter had the beef kabobs and mango/rum cheesecake for dessert, and hubby had the roasted chicken with mole sauce. \u00a0They have a nice selection of beer and wine by the glass. \u00a0Waiter was attentive, but not intrusive, presentations were nice. \u00a0We all enjoyed our meals and will definitely go back.", 
      "I really enjoy going to Escobar's! \u00a0I've been a few times, most recently for their fish tacos on \"taco tuesday.\" \u00a0Also, my boyfriend and I happened to get there a little early for the early-bird special from 5-6pm: fish tacos (or a couple other options), plus soup for only a $1 more. \u00a0We tried the red pepper gazpacho and some kind of pork stew; both were delicious. \u00a0Definitely recommend this place!", 
      "I won't go here again. The service was very slow and some of our food came cold. \u00a0I had the shrimp from the appetizer menu and didn't feel good the rest of the night. \u00a0This is definitely a miss.", 
      "Yum! \u00a0I finally made it to Escobar's, and I was not disappointed. \u00a0The food was excellent and the portions were the perfect size. \u00a0As is the case with Milo's, the dressings on the salads were divine. \u00a0Escobar's is not cheap, so minus one star, but it's a great destination for those special evenings when you are willing to spend some money on a nice meal out. \u00a0The white sangria was particularly noteworthy.My complaints would be that they were stingy with the bread. \u00a0They only gave us three slices of bread, a boring white and wheat and then some sort of corn foccicia thing that was really good, but two of us had to split a small piece so I really didn't get to enjoy it. \u00a0Also, on the jicama orange salad I had, they served the orange in slices rather than segmenting them. \u00a0This meant chewing on nasty orange membranes instead of simply enjoying the lovely combination of flavors in the salad. \u00a0I know it's probably more labor intensive for the kitchen, but when a diner pays $7 for a salad, you need to segment the damn oranges. \u00a0Overall though, these were really small things that really didn't damage my overall enjoyment of the evening. \u00a0My entree and dessert were absolutely wonderful, and the service couldn't have been better. \u00a0The food wasn't spicy at all, but was still very flavorful. \u00a0I personally would like to see a little kick added to some of the dishes, but it would be icing on the cake and they are fine without it.All in all, I really enjoyed my dinner at Escobar's and plan to go back. \u00a0It's not cheap, so I won't be a regular, but I certainly plan on coming here for birthday dinners and the like.", 
      "Escobar's has a lot going for it: location, friendly service, a chef who is fearless and skilled. What it doesn't have going for it is timing. Spouse and I have been there several times, and each and every time, there has been a timing problem in the kitchen. We've had dinners come out two minutes after our appetizers (and then left to overcook and dry out under heat lamps when we sent them back so we could eat our first course BEFORE our main course.) We've had main courses come out for half the table, with the other half left to wait five + minutes for theirs. Any time we've been there that someone has asked for a deviation from the menu - the last time it was \"no potatoes or rice, please\" - the kitchen misses the deviation. Spouse and I have had many good meals there, although not great. For us (and I stress this may just be us, having read other reviews), the portions are WAY too large, and the dishes can sometimes be needlessly complicated. The lamb wrapped in phyllo with chevre fell apart so that it was impossible to experience the textures and flavors of the phyllo, lamb, chevre and sauce in the same bite (will say the phyllo and chevre together was really good.) Add in the rice that came with it (the one we tried not to get), and the overall dish was mostly just...starchy, which stepped all over the more subtle flavors of the lamb. Like another reviewer here, we liked the dish, but it was too heavy handed. Too much food and too many competing ingredients. While the kitchen timing issue is annoying, it's not our ultimate problem with Escobar's. Escobar's just doesn't \u00a0seem to trust how very much it has going for it already, so it keeps piling other stuff on, just in case. The result is a meal that always makes us feel slightly bludgeoned afterwards and we end up returning to other places over and over before venturing to Escobar's again.", 
      "Outside seating however only a few tables. Obvious good service. Great bread started with sangria and a mix of bread some jalepeno some cinnamon. Calamari was fried, large, and excellent. Larger than anything else we have had locally. Dinner was the talapia with a honey glaze and chile sauce. It was also good. The chef poured the corn cream sauce on half of the talapia. A simple and wonderful idea that let us enjoy the dinner in different ways. The side vegetable mix was great too. Obviously cut and cooked right before the meal. The better half had a steak with a port reduction sauce. Same fresh vegetable mix. Note, I mentioned to the waitress I do not like peppers. Without asking she made sure there were none in my dinner vegetables. Good, thoughtful service. Wine menu was OK, but would not stop us from coming back. Easy parking. Outside seating.", 
      "this was easily our best meal in champaign. \u00a0we came here for brunch yesterday, and it was delish. \u00a0my brother had come for dinner before and wanted to try their brunch menu, but unfortunately, they had a special graduation menu which didn't have their usual brunch items but rather dinner fare. to start, they gave us some warm apple/banana muffins, which were delicious. \u00a0there was one brunch item, which was the crab cakes benedict, so i ordered that. \u00a0it was a nice portion and came w/ a side of sweet potato fries and fruit. \u00a0this wasn't your typical side of fruit either, b/c there were papaya, pineapple, grapes, and watermelon in the fruit salad. \u00a0yum. \u00a0everything was delicious, including the sweet potato fries. \u00a0my dad and bro's entrees came w/ a side of a carrot puree, which was yummy, and fried plantains and veggies. \u00a0i would definitely come again if i came to champaign again. \u00a0they even had pupusas on the menu, which i wouldn't expect to find in the middle of illinois.", 
      "I love this place, food is consistently good. Ambiance is nice and quaint, service is always great. I had phyllo wrapped lamb with goat cheese and a red wine reduction one of the last times I was there, it was cooked just right and delicious. \u00a0The wine list is kind of small but I always find something that suits me. \u00a0Great date place or with a group of friends...can't wait for the patio to open up!", 
      "Pricey but amazing. Everything I've ever had there is top-notch. And when you're there for brunch, you get bottomless MUFFINS! And they're amazing muffins. Try the pupusa if they still have it on the menu (I think the menu changes a lot). This place TROUNCES Radio Maria. Trounces. I can't believe more people don't go here. I suppose it may be due to its location, which is a bit lonely.", 
      "The food here is amazing, complex, surprising, delicious. The prices are reasonable for the quality and portions. Has become perhaps my favorite place to eat a little bit of a fancy meal in CU.", 
      "The flavor of their foods is not strong enough for a non-Latin America person. The decoration is classy and elegant though.", 
      "I'd like to give this place more stars (especially since it's in Champaign) but the reality is that as far as Latin-fusion goes the food here is horrible. \u00a0I went late evening with a friend and paid $15+ for some watery mole and burnt beans. \u00a0Sadly, this is the best Champaign has to offer, but if you want some real high-end Latino food stick to Chicago.", 
      "My girlfriend and I went here for the first time on Easter weekend. We started off with the calamari with aoli and their Moroccan beef soup as the appetizer. The calamari wasn't the traditional type you'd get at mainstream American restaurants but it was thicker pieces of squid with panko breading. This non-traditional set-up was quite good although the sauce that came with it could be a little bit more tangy. The Moroccan beef soup was very good, beefy but not overbearing. For the entrees, I ordered the Phyllo wrapped lamb and she the duck roast. The lamb was excellent, it came wrapped in a flaky Phyllo pastry and a succulent sauce. The sides were also superb, although I could use a little less garlic in the mashed potatoes. The duck was cooked to perfection, although the plantains and mashed sweet potatoes were left a lot to be desired.We shared dessert, which was the banana flambeed with vanilla bean ice cream. It was amazing, although it is quite hard to mess up something so innately satisfying. Overall, the presentation was superb and the waitress courteous. The atmosphere was fine for the occasion, although my girlfriend did complain about the \"orangy\" walls... haha. In any case, I highly recommend Escobar's for a good meal.", 
      "Great place for a lunch or dinner - with the office or friends. \u00a0The lunch menu is full of great options. \u00a0I always get the grilled chicken with guac and it's always good. \u00a0I can't usually eat it all because they give you so much. \u00a0The sweet potatoe fries and salad that come with it are my favorite. \u00a0I think I would be happy with just those two items. \u00a0Their house salad dressing is different and I love it. I believe they even have their own homemade ketchup if I remember correctly, good! \u00a0For dinner, I only get the Broiled tilapia with chili-honey glaze, sweet corn-cream sauce, and fried rice - WOW. The spice from the tilapia goes great with the corn. \u00a0My favorite fish around! \u00a0Portions and price are perfect.", 
      "pork chop was excellent and so were the sides. flour-less chocolate cake was delectable. waiter was a little...quirky. he sounded like napoleon dynamite.", 
      "So so blah. I never go here and it's not because of the location.", 
      "Escobar's is easily one of my favorite date spots. I have been here three times - spring, fall, and winter. The ambiance is romantic and cozy, although it does get crowded due to the restaurant's popularity and for other good reasons, too! The servers are really nice and the food is delicious! My only qualm is the hostess: she has always seemed to be disorganized or overwhelmed every time that we have visited, and does not handle it very well. Other than that, Escobar's is great.", 
      "This place was delicious! Free parking in the downtown area because they have a private lot, so that was nice too. My only complaint is that the bread and rolls were cold and the service people were confused about who would be helping us at first. I got the hanger steak with fajita veggies and it was amazing! Veggies were cooked perfectly. I could have eaten a whole plate of those.", 
      "A great place to eat without burning too big a crater in your pocket and if you want to impress your date or out-of-town relatives (or both!). The food and service is both great. I usually get their salmon dish (it seems to change a little bit each time) and it is always a winner because it is not dry but not too moist. I also tried the carne asado (medium-well) and it was also a wonderful dish with tortillas, assorted veggies, and rice and beans. Their beer selection has some variety in case wine or sangria is not for you and if you are sick of the usual suspects. I have gone here three times and it still never disappoints. This one is a winner indeed.", 
      "I wasn't thrilled with my meal here--but the drinks are great and the banana dessert was amazing as well. \u00a0Best to go here if you're into authentic Mexican dishes as opposed to fresh tex mex.", 
      "Excellent! This is one of the best places to eat in the Champaign-Urbana area. The food is delicious, the presentation is beautiful, and the menu is creative. All of this and the prices are very reasonable.", 
      "I give props to the food. Everything is delicious. My only qualm is I wish you got more food for the price. I'm sure the quality of the ingredients is exceptional, but I like being full after my meal and not having to shell out another $7 per person to leave with a full tummy. Like that one commercial - \" it's like elf food...\""

      "Ok so Maize is the most highly rated place on Yelp at UIUC for all cuisines. Combine this with the word-of-mouth it gets around campus and my liking of Mexican food, it was a must try.I came in to order take-out on a Wednesday at 5pm. The place was pretty busy with lots of call in orders, pick-ups and even a few people eating in the small sitting area. It was bustling!I grabbed a menu and took nearly 5 minutes to decide what I wanted. I wanted to try a little bit of everything but still order what I usually would. I finally decided on the Torta Aghoada (asada) and a Taco Americano (pastor). The Torta Aghoada wasn't exactly what I was expecting and part due to my own ignorance. I thought for sure what I was getting was going to be flat with all the ingredients on top. Nope, my memories of high school Spanish deceived me and the torta is a sandwich. I got it confused with a tostada....d'oh! Regardless, I had never had anything like it even in the south suburbs of Chicago where I'm from (maybe I should have Mexican more often). The sandwich was piled with carne asada, beans, cheese, avocado spread, lettuce sour cream and spicy sauce. Unfortunately, the spicy sauce was very overwhelming and I wasn't able to embrace all the flavors of the torta, especially the avocado spread and the meat. In all fairness, I was warned that it was spicy, so I can't complain about it!I also ordered a pastor (pork) taco Americano. I guess the Americano taco comes with more than just a traditional Mexican taco, namely lettuce and maybe even cilantro or onions. This was surprisingly good. The pork had great flavor and didn't taste overly salty. The only thing this taco needed was sour cream!Also included with my take-out order was salsa and chips. I got 2 little cups of salsa and a small bag of chips, which was enough for me since I had ordered a pretty large amount of food, but may not be sufficient for a group of people. The chips were surprisingly good and didn't taste like they were out of a bag. The red salsa was too liquidy to eat just with the chips, but had great flavor. I enjoyed the spiciness and consistency of the darker salsa, but didn't like the taste as much. Either way, they were both decent.I really enjoyed my food from Maize. It's not the crappy Mexican you pay $1/taco for and its also not Rick Bayless expensive, but does sit very well towards the better side of those two and the portion size is very good (I was stuffed after eating everything). I will definitely be back in to try some of their other things. A fair warning though, the menu inside is a little different from the one online (maybe it changes?).", 
      "Restaurant review:Simply delicious. Yelp was spot on that this location has likely the freshest high quality mexican food that may top the best in the US. It was so busy 30 minutes into opening that we had to take our food to go. There is a wide selection of authentic mexican dishes. I ended up with a selection of tacos (steak, pork, and carnitas). Although they were soggy by the time I got home, the ingredients were so fresh and the flavor was perfect. Not too salty and rich in flavor. The prices are perfect a lot cheaper than Rick Bayless Xoco. I just wish it was easier to find parking or even space to eat in. You get chips and 2 types of salsa for free as well even if you are getting carry out. I was surprised I only got 1 bag even with four entrees. I will have to make sure I ask for more next time. Overall this is probably the best mexican restaurant I have ever been toPro: delicious mexican authentic and fresh Cons: very small parking lot and equally small dining areaHidden gem:Free salsa and chips", 
      "I came here on a Saturday for lunch and it was packed so we took our food to go. By the time I was able to eat my torta ahogada, it had already soaked up all the spicy sauce it was swimming in and was soggy and quickly disintegrating. Normally I'm pretty tolerant to spicy foods but all I could taste was spicy. My friend got 3 fish tacos, which were super tiny. He was still hungry afterwards so he had san other full meal. Overall, it did not live up to all the good reviews I kept reading about on Yelp.", 
      "Everything I have gotten from here has tasted amazing. Maize doesn't have much indoor seating and there aren't many parking spots. They always have a long line. Despite all these cons, you can never go wrong when ordering food here. They handle long lines really well. That have gotten used to long lines. My favorite thing to get here is their torta de milanesa. Their chips are really good; They might be a little greasy for some people but I can't get enough of them. They give you two different types of salsa with your food and both of them are really good. Their menu is simple and easy to understand. They also have your classic Mexican sodas. The prices of all their food is cheep. I would pay more for the quality of the food they provide. I hope that in the future they expand their restaurant because the food, service, and environment is really good. If you don't know what to get you should try their quesadillas.", 
      "I'm from San Diego, CA. We generally have the most authentic Mexican food in that part of the country. Maize is the most authentic you can get in the Midwest. Everything about the food is really good. And the service is quick, friendly and the restaurant is really clean.", 
      "Fantastic food! Gluten-free friendly, too!My wife and I went there on a whim in between appointments at Carle Hospital. I got two carne asada tacos and she got a chicken taco americano. Good stuff! I grew up in Phoenix, AZ and recently spent 18 mos in Southern California for work and this is the only place in C-U that I have eaten at in which I don't feel like I'm settling for inferior/americanized food. Tasty, authentic and very friendly. My only complaint is that there is so little seating we can't take our kids there to eat - we'll have to do takeout.", 
      "I love this place! Try the tlacoyo if you haven't. With a side of rice and beans, you got yourself a meal. The tlacoyo with al pastor is my favorite. The meat is really flavorful. Mmmm. It's topped with cream, cotija cheese, and cilantro. It's delicious!", 
      "I have had the beef burrito and the amazing melted cheese, and felt both of them are sooooo good!", 
      "Never disappoints, the carne asada burrito is delicious. The service is fast and friendly. You probably should take it to go though, not much seating.", 
      "I travel for a living and have probably eaten at over a hundred Mexican restaurants AND I just got back from Mexico, yet Maize is seriously one of the top 5 Mexican restaurants I've been, maybe even top 3. Wow! There are 2 hot sauces served with chips, the red one is ok but the more yellow one is UNREAL. Delish! Very unique sauce!!!Guacamole and chips: A+They have real Mexican sodas like Jaritos and Coca Cola (made with cane sugar, not high fructose corn syrup as in the US recipe).The tacos were the best! I'm sure the tortillas are hand made. Yum! There is very limited seating (less than 20 spots) so it's hard to get in but the wait is well worth it. Thanks for having such high standards, \u00a0Maize; we the (eating) people appreciate it!", 
      "Awesome, fast, cheap. Great food, quick service. 4/5 because its super, super, SUPER cramped in there!", 
      "Small restaurant and relatively long queue, but they serve at blazing speed! The chorizo burrito is cheap and tasty.", 
      "Everything here is fantastic except the food. I like the fact that it is a small venue and there is a few seats for the patrons. The staff here is extremely friendly and kind. The service is fast when there isn't a long wait. The food is terrible. I ate here a few times last week and each time it was disappointing. The meat (steak) was flawed on many levels. It is a poor cut, not carne asada but something cheaper. The burrito here is small and there is very little meat to begin with. I also tried the tacos and they too were bland. The guacamole is alright and the sauces add some flavor. I am not sure why everyone thinks, writes highly of this place. The owner should do justice and actually use descent meat and not rubbish. You are not doing a service to anyone except your bank account. Sad. TBK would be put this place to shame.", 
      "My absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area (and perhaps of all-time). The ingredients of every entree are fantastically fresh, the food is very quickly served, and the service is fantastic. The menu is extremely simple to navigate, and the ladies who work the register are very kind and helpful. On most days, I eat the veggie burrito here, and I'm always elated to eat it. It's cheaper than Chipotle, and that much tastier!Do note that the restaurant is extremely small, so seating may be tough to find at peak hours, but it is 100% always worth the wait.I made it a point to go to this restaurant weekly instead of attending one of my lectures. That was one of the best decisions of my life.", 
      "Good authentic Mexican food. I was a little worried when I pulled up because of how small the place is but it was good. Thank you Yelp for leading me here.", 
      "Food is tasty, service is great but the seating capacity and parking need to be addressed. I'm surprised this place hasn't expanded b/c they do have great food. But the dining feels like i'm eating in a packed standing elevator. If you choose to dine in, try to go before peak hours or after.The price is a bit expensive but worth the money.", 
      "I could write a really long review about this place but I'm going to be short and sweet. \u00a0I've traveled through all 50 states and eaten at a ton of great restaurants. \u00a0This little dive in the middle of Illinois is on my top ten list. \u00a0I happened to see this place on yelp when I was working in town and I just had a feeling it was going to be good. \u00a0But it exceeded every expectation. \u00a0They are the real deal! \u00a0Every single thing I've tried there was absolutely phenomenal! \u00a0And they aren't just serving up the basic tacos and burritos. \u00a0No they do gorditas, chalupas, tlacoyas, and much more! \u00a0The salsa is homemade and is awesome too! \u00a0Simply put, if you live in Champaign or are traveling through it or anywhere near it this place is a MUST!!!!!!!", 
      "It really doesn't get better than this when it comes to Mexican in champaign. \u00a0From their chorizo burritos and nachos to the tortas and tacos, this place is worth braving that long line that snakes out the door into sub zero temps. \u00a0Maize always hits the spot (sadly, even when you occasionally find a bit of bone in the chicken.)", 
      "Maize has become something of an obsession for me and many of my friends. We love the tacos there and the consensus is that Maize will be the food of Champaign-Urbana that we miss the most when we move away. (This says a lot because it won out over campus bars with sentimental value, downtown bars with good food/alcohol, Papa Dell's and many other venues.) The place is small, so we tend to call in our order and show up to pick it up. When we've ordered on site, there was usually a line, but the wait was never too long and the food was always worth it. Our favorite item there is the fish tacos, but we also enjoy the chips and salsa. This is definitely the top Mexican place in my opinion and it is super affordable and tasty.", 
      "Best Mexican food place in champaign. Everyone needs to eat here!! Seriously!! Their tacos are bomb.", 
      "Awesome for eat in, and mostly for take out too. Fast, cheap and friendly.When will they open in downtown champaign?", 
      "They are one of the best place in town. I really like their chorizo burrito a lot and that is what I usually get. I hear their tacos are great as well. This place gets packed so ordering ahead and doing a take out is advised.", 
      "Maize is closer to a fine restaurant than a storefront. This would be one of the top 5 Mexican places in Chicago, even.Everything is seared to a crust, exactly how it's supposed to be. Masa is pressed to order as sopes, tacos, huerachas, etc. Ingredients are generously applied, almost absurdly so. They have two salsas, and both are excellent complements to their recipes. Prices are low, you can eat like a king for under $10. Food comes out quick, in less than 10 minutes.Most of all, everything tastes phenomenal. This is a special place and I hope UIUC appreciates it.", 
      "Solid a la carte taco joint. Quick friendly service and good, reasonably priced food. I'll be back.", 
      "Best Chicken Burrito in CU. Absolutely love this place, just wish they would open up a bigger location!", 
      "Best Mexican food in town! Park somewhere else and walk up for your food though, spaces are limited and it fills up fast. Totally worth the trouble, and a great place to bring visitors.", 
      "Very delicious. My sister said: muy deliciouso My wife said: 5 starsGood traditional food. Very very small inside. Nice size portions.Loved it overall, I'll be coming back. Note: confusing terms in the menu, due to authentic atmosphere, ex: pastor = porkTry it! You'll never find a chain this good.", 
      "I had heard a lot about Maize before I tried it myself. Everyone who I talked to seemed to have enjoy their meal there, so I was rather excited when I pulled up together with a friend yesterday evening. My first thought was \"Wow, they weren't kidding when they said that it's small.\" It seems like a perfect place to get food to-go and seating is very limited.I ordered a burrito with pastor and my friend ordered torte with pastor. The food was really well priced and arrived at the speed of light! We had a seat at the counter and ate our meals there. The staff quickly served up our Jarritos (before we sat down even) and chips together with a delicious spicy habanero (I think) sauce. We were both satisfied with the burrito and the torte and enjoyed our dinner at Maize. Highly recommended if you're looking for a quick, delicious, affordable meal!", 
      "Great Mexican food in the Chambana area. What is particularly wonderful is the freshness of the ingredients used in the food. Burritos and tacos are on the menu of course, but the carne asada and fajita plates are wonderful.Parking is difficult (there are only a few spots) and at times there may be a long line, takeout service is quick - you can also call ahead and your order will be ready for pick-up when you arrive.", 
      "If you have any bad things to say about this restaurant, then you have issues. Everything on their menu is authentic and fantastic. The only down side I can possibly think of is the fact that it's good is too good, and there will always be a line to place your order for food. But do not let that turn you away! You can always place your order early through phone and pick up your food when you arrive! That's what i do when I am tight on schedule. I honestly cannot recommend any specific dishes because they are all very good! I usually just ask the cashier what they are in the mood for, and I will take that recommendation. The restaurant itself is small so there is very little chance that you can actually sit down to eat on site. But if you do, definitely have their chips and salsa. They are worth every second of wait! They also provide some authentic Latino drinks that you do not usually see everywhere else!The price for the restaurant is definitely reasonable. It may be a little out of students way, but definitely worth the effort, especially if the weather is getting better!", 
      "Just passing through on our way from WI to Indy, we stopped because of the positive yelp reviews and we were trying to make time on our trip. \u00a0A few things stand out:1.). Yes the place is small...however we found seating as soon as we ordered as the turnover was quick +12.). The staff was very friendly +13.). Chips and salsa were delivered almost instantly (and free) when we sat down and noticed that's the standard here. \u00a0The chips were firm and thick, solid combo with the spicy two salsas they served +24.). \u00a0Prices and food both good, bordering on great! +1 (I had the burrito and a taco americano with chorizo, the burrito was delish and would have been enough by itself )5.). Speed - we were in and out in 20-30 mins", 
      "YUM YUM YUM!I would have to say they have the best Mexican food on campus!They have everything from tacos and burritos to flautas and tortas. I can't even put into words how delicious everything thing is. I really wish I could give them 5 stars but can't because of their limited seating areas, such small store space, and limited parking. Really, other than that. It's wonderful :)", 
      "Very small place but well worth squeezing in. We had tacos and tostadas both were excellent.", 
      "The best Mexican in Champaign hands down. Fast, great value, and a good spot to dine in as long as it's not peak hours (it gets cramped fast).", 
      "I'd like to give this place a second shot after an underwhelming first visit. I got some sticker shock (after being told how cheap it was), paying almost $10 for a fish taco and a very small tostada, both of which were good for Champaign, but a bit bland. I'm hoping other menu items will be more fulfilling, and at the very least filling.I'd also assumed that, since they apparently offer free chips and salsa at the restaurant, I would get some with my takeaway order. I was disappointed to find out, upon arriving home with my order, that is not the case, so it felt like an even worse deal than I originally thought. I will definitely give it a second shot now that I know what to expect, but I wish they had their prices listed on the website and that they made it clear you only get chips and salsa with dine-in service. Service was friendly and fast. Parking is horrendous (only a few parking spots, and very limited street parking nearby), but that is no fault of the restaurant; just be aware you might have to circle the block a few times before a spot opens up.", 
      "Food here is good! I have tried different items and have always liked it. It's one of the few good Mexican restaurants in the area. However, the place is just too cramp. There's barely any space to move around and definitely no personal space during busy hours. It's only good for take out.", 
      "Dear Maize, On planet earth, a torta is a crispy bolillo roll with various fillings, a kind of a sandwich that one holds in one's hands and sinks one's teeth into. It really doesn't matter if you can point to some group of earthlings who recognize a torta by any designation to be presented as a soppy, glue-like, waterlogged roll to be eaten out of a bowl with a spoon. There are exceptions to all good things, and your decision to serve a sandwich as a soggy concoction floating in broth makes your taqueria is one of them.", 
      "LOVE this place. Don't let its small size or hole-in-the-wall style intimidate you. Their steak burritos are the best in town (in my opinion). Great value (burrito and chips are under $6) when weighting portions, price, and quality. And you get fresh, warm, homemade chips and their own unique salsa free with every burrito order. Their service is quick and their staff is friendly. Townies know to call ahead and order your food if you are going to do takeout. Then when you get there you can just walk right in, pay, and leave! If your in Chambana and havent tried this place you are missing out!", 
      "Cinco Estrellas?? That does not do this place justice. This jawn is Heisenberg level Mexican cuisine, at a Los pollos hermanos price point.Every time I have eaten at maize, the food has been consistently fresh & consistently delicious. The proportions are generous, with no corners cut that I can tell ( except lettuce at the bottom of the guacamole to make it appear as a larger quantity, but that's common practice everywhere)The only thing this place needs to do is obtain a bigger space or open another location.. It kinda cramps my style"

      "HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE PLACE IN CHAMPAIGN/URBANA. I have been craving real Mexican food since I've moved out here for school and it definitely fulfills the feeling of real Mexican food. It makes me feel like I'm at home. Good service and fast. I can't wait to visit more times!", 
      "I wanted to cry from happiness when I bit into my burrito--it was that good.This is by far THE BEST food I've had in the Chambana area. \u00a0I had the horchata along with my meal as well and it was delish! \u00a0Definitely a step up from Chipolte, and a better deal, too. \u00a0You get chips and salsa packaged with your meal for free!", 
      "Came here once with my friends and will definitely come back for more. The tacos are amazing and my favorite is fried chicken quesadilla. Their salsas are delicious and spicy enough for my taste. The place is quite small, so we just ordered take out. And the price is quite certainly right for the quality food they're serving here.", 
      "Let's be clear- the 5 stars is about the food and the service. \u00a0This isn't a fancy 5 star restaurant but that's not what the stars mean on Yelp- as we all (should) know!We moved here from Southern California in August, so it's safe to say we've had our share of excellent traditional Mexican food. \u00a0Since our first trip to Maize we go there at least once a week- it's so good.BE PREPARED: Parking can be a problem and it's almost always packed. \u00a0People frequently come in and order for takeout. In our experience, by the time we order a seat almost always clears up. \u00a0We have never taken it to go. \u00a0If you eat there, you get free (freshly made!) chips and salsa while you wait for your food. \u00a0Since it's just the two of us, we have always been lucky. \u00a0If you have a big group, I'd suggest ordering it to go and eating at home or having a picnic. \u00a0You can call your order in too, which is nice.The food is always ready super fast, so even if you order to go, you won't wait long. \u00a0The staff is extremely kind and happy to answer questions if you're not sure what something is. \u00a0I've tried many things on the menu but keep coming back to the tacos- chicken or fish are my fav- because of the RIDICULOUSLY amazing corn tortillas. \u00a0So. Good.Word on the street is that they'll be opening a larger location near the Amtrak in Champaign soon.", 
      "OMG! I love Maize. My only sadness is that I can't eat wheat and corn right now - making Mexican food hard to stomach. But - the quesadlla with mushrooms and chicken! And the tlacoyo with pastor - the best! They're really fast and friendly. Highly recommend.", 
      "This is my favorite restaurant in Chambana!!! And it's pretty plain to see that this is a nearly unanimous consensus. I've been there dozens of time and have had just about every item on the menu -- everything is absolutely delicious! My all-time favorite items are the al pastor torta ahogada and al pastor/carne asada buritto.Growing up in Colorado I've had plenty of delicious Mexican food and I have to say that this is some of the best Mexican food I've ever had!", 
      "Great little Mexican place, best for take out.Can't wait until they open the larger restaurant downtown.", 
      "Maize was one of my go-to lunch places when I lived in Chambana. I'm from New York, so I'm not exactly an expert on Mexican food, but everything I ever got at Maize was excellent--chalupas, gorditas, tacos, and burritos. (The chalupas especially... maybe I should fly back to Champaign for the weekend...) The people working were friendly and the service was prompt. Maize is, food-wise, one of the best places to eat in Champaign-Urbana.The only downside of this place is its tininess. There's room inside for about a dozen people sitting elbow to elbow. I always got takeout, and even standing around waiting for my order I always felt like I was in someone's way. The parking lot is proportionately small too, with only four or five spots, so you may not even be able to park at Maize to get takeout. (Fortunately it's within easy walking distance of campus, and the Green bus line goes right by so you might not have to drive.) If this restaurant were to expand and keep the same menu it would be fantastic.", 
      "Disappointed in the Mexican food choices in Champaign? El Sombrero, Dos Unrealness, fiesta of mexico!?. You should be disappointed because the food is mostly just reheated.Ready to level up? Enter Maize. All ingredients are fresh and made on the spot. Seriously you can see the tortilla making presses in the back. I sometimes wonder if they have lettuce and tomato plants back there because it tastes that fresh.I eat here minimum 3 times a week. Not only is this the best Mexican food in town but probably the best food in town.Favorite items? Burrito + Avocado, Fish Tacos, Guacamole, Steak Tacos, Tostadas, Chicken Volcanes... seriously tho... everything on the menu is best. Level Up to Maize.", 
      "I absolutely love this place. Best Mexican food in CU hands down. I order the chips an guacamole to start, and then the chicken fajitas as an entree. The portions are huge and I had enough for 2 meals. The food was so satisfying and delicious. My boyfriend and I got lucky and actually got a seat at the window, but I always carry out. Their horhata is also very delicious, I come here all the time.", 
      "Came here when they were about to close & they gladly served us. Prices are cheap. Didn't really find anything special about the tacos but maybe cause I'm from Texas & also I got it with the standard corn tortilla. (It is called Maize though so kinda of makes sense. Lol) I think you may be able to ask for flour tortillas though.", 
      "My brother (Pat E., Elite Yelper, Pancake Lover) suggested we try Maize for lunch instead of our usual SUnday fare (eggs, pancakes). Our stomaches have been programmed to eat brunch style food on Sundays for as long as I remember. I'll be honest, I was a bit nervous going for Mexican, but it turned out to be a great choice!We arrived around 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was jam packed, which is not surprising because it's the size of a panic room. There's about 12-15 seats total in the place, and it's definitely crammed. They are actually in the process of opening up a sit down place in the area, and per one of the workers, it's in the final stages of opening. This was my bro's 2nd time here, so he took the lead. He ordered a ribeye taco, a fish taco, a hultihoche (corn smut) quesadilla, and a steak tlacoyo. The tlacoyo is bascially an open faced taco.I ordered a steak (carne asada taco), a chorizo taco, a pumpkin flower quesadilla, and a pork (pastor) tlacoyo. We both decided to ask for our sour cream on the side for our tlacoyos, because we like being in control, and we wanted to use the SC for other dishes.Only one word can describe my meal: A-MAIZE-ING (I'm sure I'm the first person to use this)!Our food came out promptly. Our drinks were always full, and everything was extremely flavorful, including the salsas that came with our chips (we each had a few).The tacos were topped with cilantro and onions. Quick note: Everything here is made with corn tortillas (get that white crap outta here!) Also, gluten free, if you swing that way. The carne asada was so good, and they didn't skimp on the portion size either! The chorizo was zesty but not spicy, which I preferred. I was expecting it to be sliced up like a sausage, but it was actually ground chorizo. Either way, the tacos were amazing! My only complaint.... too small! But for 2.25 a taco, a very fair price.The pastor tlacoyo was the first dish I actually dove into. Topped with cheese, I added my sour cream quite liberally anyways, and I did not regret it! The pork did not have as much flavor as the other meats, but that's not to say it was bad. Still very good!! I added the darker salsa to the tlacoyo, which may have masked the flavor of the pork, but I'm not sure. You have the option of grilled or fried for this dish, and I went with grilled.Finally, to the quesadilla, my favorite part of the meal. Filled with cheese and pumpkin flower, this was the best tasting dish for me. I also liked how the quesadilla came with lettuce and tomato, which can be placed on top or eaten by itself, which is what I did, along with the lighter salsa. At the end of the meal, I added sour cream to the top, which was amazing!All in all, our 8 dishes added up to 25 dollars. Very reasonable for the amount of food! If you decide to eat here, yes, it's cramped, but I thought it was a cool experience. I thought it was weird how a group of 3 adults came with a baby, and nestled up in the corner. Not really a great place for kids, let alone babies.There were plenty of to go orders being placed and picked up while we were there. They are very fast in the kitchen!Highly recommended! After my last mexican dining experience (Fernando's in Chicago), this was the polar opposite. Great food, service, prices, and memorable, for all the right reasons. I can't wait to head back for my next visit!", 
      "I've experienced Maize 3 times now, so I feel like nothing can be chalked up to just bad luck at this point.I've had the tacos all 3 times. Carne asada. Sadly, just not good (I know, I should've tried something else...). Meat is dry, served in a relatively small soft tortilla with a bed of mostly cilantro and some onions. Rice is a bit dry as well. Chips and salsa are free with every order. Hard to complain about free, but... I'll try. The chips are okay, but the salsa is basically bland tomato water with some tomato chunks. The guac here is good though. 2 tacos cost almost $5; too expensive for me considering I'm still hungry afterwards.This might be an issue only with takeout though, as the food I received looks different from the images here of food that was dine-in.Service was great. Everyone I interacted with on the staff was very nice and friendly. Food took just about 2 or 3 minutes from ordering to get to my hands.Be prepared to get it takeout, as seating is very minimal here, 12-15 people max at any time.Random fact: 2 of the 3 times I had Maize was at a Yelp tech talk.", 
      "I went here with three other teachers on a Wednesday night. To say this place cramped would be THE understatement of the year. The second time I went here I visited with my twin brother. Both trips were FANTASMIC (yep). It did open us up to hearing a conversation that two of the biggest nerds on Illinois campus were having. It was hilarious because while they were talking about geometry, machines, and other things nerds talk about they were swearing like sailors. So not scientific, bro! \"My flux compactor connected to the tangent...blah\". The second time I visited, I was treated to a conversation about Ernest Hemingway and \"Old Man and the Sea\". That was good. The lady who was talking about said author also mentioned how much she enjoyed Franklin BBQ in Austin, Texas. She was wearing one of those baby in front backpacks with a baby inside. Folks, in a restaurant this small, there is no point in having children. Get it to go!I was told that they will be opening up a sister restaurant in the old Cafe Luna location. It was hilarious because the cashier told me that this was the case and I acted like I knew EXACTLY where it was...which I do not! HEHE. It should be open by the end of 2013...they're just waiting on permits. It will also include appetizers and drinks...heck yeah, college!This place seems authentic; what I mean by authentic is not made from a package. MADE IN HOUSE! As a matter of fact, the grads and undergrads lining up out the door made me realize...THIS IS AUTHENTIC...and their prices are excellent! I ended up paying 10.32 for three items. The second time I went here I got an extra taco and it was a great choice!Among the simple menu, I decided to go with a fish taco, pumpkin flower quesadilla, and asada tlacoyo. All were fantastic! The workers were very nice and accommodated all my complicated questions (How do you say \"tlacoyo\" and it is all grilled, right?). I love how they have masa...corn based tortillas! So great! Get that white flour sh*t outta here! Those empty carbohydrates...I AIN'T GOT THAT KINDA TIME! My friends ordered some burritos, quesadillas, and some guacamole. IT WAS LIKE AVOCADO HEAVEN!I've also sampled the ribeye taco and the corn smut tortilla. All the items I've had here are fantasticThe mild AND hot salsas were excellent as well! I had to order mas (Spanish)I don't always eat Mexican in CU...but when I do...I do Maize. Simply amaizing. Pun entirely intended. I'd would order to go if I come again or just try their sit down (done by the end of the month).Based on the food (6), service (5), and restaurant experience (4), I have to give Maize a 5 star review. If this place was bigger, I would go every weekend. Actually, I might go every weekend anyway. It has a street food feel to it. This is one of my top CU area joints! Guy Fieri and Jimmy John (yes, that Jimmy John) have tried this place...which actually led me to find it. I highly recommend!", 
      "Best.Food.In C-U.I realize that the bar is very low, indeed, but this place ROCKS. You will not believe how delicious it is, or how cheap. Go here now.", 
      "Inexpensive and delicious. Bright cheerful counter with pretty green tiles and helpful servers. The fresh tortillas make everything delicious. Loved the chalupa and the yellow salsa was fresh and unusual. Well worth the two mile drive from the highway for such a pleasant meal.", 
      "This place is worth every bit of this five star rating. The prices are good and more importantly the food is delicious. The free nachos and salsas make it even better. You can't really go wrong with whatever you get here whether it's a burrito or fajita--it all tastes authentic and way better than any of the other campus restaurants serving Mexican food. Wait times aren't bad and the staff is friendly as well. If there's a place where you want to be known as a \"regular\", this one's it.", 
      "This place has excellent food and service. The people working there are responsive and the service is quick. It is definitely one of the best places to get Mexican food in the area. The food is top-tier, nicely prepared, and authentic. Definitely try the chalupa...fried!However, the dining area is small so I would suggest going on off hours.", 
      "Anything you get here is great. Really. I always tend towards the pastor because I am a pork fan, but the chicken or steak are all great too. Whenever someone visits me from out of town, the two places I take them to eat are here and Black Dog. The only person I have ever known who doesn't like Maize was one of my old roommates... but he also used to put ketchup and cheese on bread and call it a meal, so take that with a grain (or heaping mound) of salt.", 
      "aaaaahhh-MAIZE-ing!!! And, no... this place is not over-hyped! This little taco shack on the corner of Green & 1st is life changing. Friendly staff that serve up fresh, hot, flavorful food with smiles! Yes, it is tiny and cramped (bar seating for less than 15 people). Yes, the parking lot sucks. Yes, there are times where the line is out the door and around the building. But it is all worth it!! I'd highly recommend the Volcanes. Grilled cheese taco with your choice of meat... It's like a quesadilla and taco had a tasty love baby. Yummy! I really enjoyed the carne asada, pastor and chorizo. The chips and salsa were delicious, too! Btw... just found out that they are opening a second location this summer on Chestnut where Luna used to be!Peace, love & tacos!", 
      "Great food! \u00a0Love the guac and hot salsa. \u00a0I wish they could get more parking spaces, and hopefully they get that other location open soon!", 
      "This hole-in-the-wall location is perfectly lovely. Believe the hype, people. My Texan friend complained that their tacos weren't spicy enough, but I'm sure you can let them know to up the spice level for you. I love that they make their own corn tortillas (which are gluten-free, friends). They also fry or grill any meat of your choosing. I met the owner once to interview him for Best of CU for Buzz, and he was the sweetest guy from Mexico City. He recommends the authentic fish tacos. I love their pumpkin flower and corn fungus quesadillas and their chicken volcanes, but all their menu items are perfectly delicious. All orders come with a side of chips with two types of lip-smacking salsa.Rather long wait sometimes, but just go at odd hours or endure the wait. They have an array of authentic Mexican sodas waiting inside as well. Seating is rather fickle and sparse, so get ready to carry out unless you're eating plus one. Enjoy!", 
      "First, Maize is very good in the authentic Mexican taqueria tradition. They have a number of grilled or fried items from which to choose, as well as \u00a0a couple of good sides like guacamole. On each item, you can choose from the following meats: carne asada, chicken, chorizo, or pastor. My favorite is the flavorful pastor (marinated roast pork). Common co-toppings include a wonderful fresh, salty cheese, salsa fresca, sour cream, and cilantro. A variety of salsa comes with, and each bite of every item is delicious, with or without the salsa, which is very good. Tacos, burritos, tostadas, tortas, tlacoyos, challupas, quesadillas, gorditas, flautas, and huarches are all available. Honestly, they are variations on a theme, rather than distinctively different. Choose your texture. I'm an especially big fan of the tlacoyos (stuff served on top of a piece of grilled chewy flat bread -- you can get the bread fried, but grilled is better). Some of the items do offer interesting add-ons. For example, you can add pumpkin flowers or or mushrooms to the quesadillas.Maize is located in a small converted space, with just a few seats around the main counter and a counter that runs immediately behind along the back wall. Seats are counter stools. At busy times, customers who are waiting for food get packed in too, or wait outside. The parking lot is equally small. We prefer to get our food to go, and it is always well worth the trip. Prices are inexpensive for the quality -- an excellent value.", 
      "so i revisited this place yesterday during lunch and i was really satisfied with my food!~ yummy yummy juicy pork tacos and complimentary chips & salsa! yeahhhhhhh i ate so much (4 big tacos down my stomach in like 10 minutes - i should definitely sign up for a eating competition or something haha~)", 
      "Best Mexican food in Chambana (and anywhere else that I've eaten)! That is all that needs to be said about the food.The place is tiny with very limited seating and limited parking. If you go during lunch or dinner rush, your best bet is to get food to go or even call ahead and order for pickup.I recommend the asada burrito, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.", 
      "I don't even like Mexican, but I LOVE this place! \u00a0Hands down one of the best places to eat in Champaign. \u00a0Unbelievable food and also inexpensive! \u00a0Everything on the menu is great, but my absolute favorite is the fried tlacoyo with pastor. \u00a0Words cannot describe how yummy it is!Chips and salsa come with every order, which makes it possible for me to order one tlacoyo and be full for just FOUR DOLLARS! \u00a0Simply Amazing. \u00a0I love you Maize.", 
      "Let me start by saying the food was awesome. \u00a0It was hot, it was flavorful, and after I ordered it was in front of me in under 5 minutes. \u00a0The chips and salsa that come with it are also pretty tasty.The establishment itself is tiny. \u00a0we are talking maximum occupancy of 15 kind of tiny for seating, there is the low bar at the counter and the high bar lining the exterior windows and that is all. \u00a0Very cramped, makes this place more of a to go only restaurant unless you like feeling like a sardine.The parking lot was even worse, there are maybe 6 spots to park and 2 are handicap spots. \u00a0I got lucky and pulled into one with my tiny Kia Soul that barely squeezed into the spot on the end simultaneously pissing off the other 12 cars trying to figure out how to park at this establishment and not having much luck.Overall, The food is great, get it to go and walk there if you can because you are not going to find a place to park.", 
      "Maize has the best Mexican food on campus hands down. Everything I have tried there has been nothing but delicious. The service is fast and friendly, the price is relatively inexpensive, and anything you order comes with chips and salsa, making it a great value! I would recommend ordering to go because of the small size of the restaurant. Would love to see these guys expand into a larger space!", 
      "My favorite Mexican food. Food, salsa, and chips are all amazing. Price is amazing. If you eat there you can get unlimited chips. Can't find a better Mexican place than this. I wish they would expand and get a bigger place!", 
      "Their food is good, inexpensive, and fast. If you go during the off peak hours and order a burrito they'll frequently have it out to you faster than you can sit down and pull your phone out. As other people have said it's very cosy. If you're more than two people eating during peak times you're probably better off getting take out.The small parking lot during crowded times can make for fun watching as you eat. Note they don't have a bike rack, and there isn't anywhere good out front to lock a bike up. It's bit annoying (but all their pluses more than make up for it).", 
      "I've eaten mexican in Chicago. I've eaten mexican in southern California. I've eaten mexican in Texas. I've eaten in Oaxaca mexico. This place is right up there. I'll admit the first time I went I was skeptical. It's way too small, and the chips and salsa leave something to be desired (but, seriously, who cares?). Once the food came I was absolutely convinced by the hype. The al pastor buritto was incredible. The flavors were authentic, the meat was moist and delicious, and everything about that burrito told me that this place was a winner. Every time I have been back since the food has been just as good. Tortas, tacos, burritos, flautas, sopes, you name it; this place has it all and it's all fantastic. I have yet to try something that didn't leave me full, satisfied, and waiting to be hungry again so I could come back.This place is sensational. The prices are low and the food is first rate. Just, do yourself a favor and order to go. The place simply isn't big enough to house all the hungry maize addicts trying to get their fix.", 
      "Went here with my girlfriend and the staff was very friendly. \u00a0She got the chalupas and I got the fajitas. Both dishes tasted amazing! \u00a0I could tell that everything was made in house and the cooks took pride in their food. \u00a0The atmosphere was hectic but \u00a0that's to be expected because it has very limited seating and most of the patrons do carry out. \u00a0 One of the girls working said they were opening a dine in location at some point. \u00a0Sooner is better as I can't wait to sit down to a good meal from here. -one star off for limited parking and very limited seating.", 
      "So I've been twice now. The first time was crazy good, but I wanted to wait to write a review, just in case it was a fluke. It wasn't.I just had the pastor (seasoned pork) burrito. Suddenly you feel like Chipotle is bland. This thing roars with lime and texture and spice. I had the spicy salsa--it's bright yellow and has layers of flavor. And the staff I've encountered are warm and quick to help.This place looks like a hole in the wall on the corner of 1st and Green--I don't know what they're gonna do, but I hope this place is a permanent addition to Champaign and Campustown.", 
      "This place is the best Mexican food I've ever had! Easily the best Mexican food in Champaign. \u00a0My only complaint is how small this place is. \u00a0They really need to expand and serve alcohol. \u00a0Also, since they're so close to campus, \u00a0the crowd can be a little unbearable.", 
      "Best Mexican in Champaign, huge affordable menu, very fresh ingredients. \u00a0The only minus about this place is the lack of inside seating, it's basically a take out spot. \u00a0When they open their spot downtown Champaign I think it will be one of the premier spots in C-U.", 
      "Maize is my favorite restaurant ever. The tacos are even better than tacos in Los Angeles. Try the tomatillo salsa. It's heavenly. Unfortunately, I no longer live in Champaign, so I can't eat there every day. Man, what I wouldn't do for that tomatillo recipe. I LOVE YOU, MAIZE!", 
      "I have had a lot of tacos, these are probably the best. The exterior leaves much to be desired and seating is nil, but the hassle is well worth the incredible food. I strongly recommend the chorizo sope and the guacamole.", 
      "This place is amazing! We were driving through Illinois on our way to Wisconsin and read some positive yelp reviews and decided to try Mexican for lunch!Yes, it is very small and you need to wait your turn for seating, but the turnover was quick and once we sat down we got our drinks and free chips and salsa immediately (great chips and two sauces).My husband ordered the carne asada torta ahogada. And it was huge and he said the special spicy sauce was perfect: hot AND tons of flavor. He also ordered the chalupas. There were actually three per plate-it was probably the best shaved pork I've ever had. Either of those dishes alone would have made a substantial size lunch. I ordered the chicken gordita (I think it was supposed to come with beans, but I'm glad it didn't, the chicken was so flavorful and enough on it's own). Lastly (I know we were pigs today!) we had a beef volcane. The volcane was probably our least favorite, but the tortilla it was on, and the cheese it was covered in, were delicious (not soggy at all).Highly recommend for a low-key, cheap, fun, filling meal!", 
      "LOVE this place! I'm addicted. I could come here everyday. Everything on the menu is pretty cheap and super affordable. Every time I come, there is a huge line out the door, so be prepared to wait. It is definitely well worth the wait! The place is small too, so be ready to fight someone for a seat. Here's what I've had:-fish tacos (small but good)-tortas (I've tried carne asada, chorizo, and milanesa)-queso fundido with carne asada (melted cheese - really greasy)Their tortas are the best! They are only around $5 and it's a pretty large portion. Also, each meal comes with free chips and salsa!!", 
      "Saaaaaalty. The last 2 times I ate there were greasy and salty. Disappointed. Take out seems to be where they fall down on quality in particular."

      "OK, I was suspicious that Maize was writing their own reviews, but after a Friday evening visit in October, 2011, I now understand why their growing but new fan base is over-the-top loyal and giddy about the joint. \u00a0The atmosphere was intimate, the parking lot was packed, there were no available stools. \u00a0We overheard a customer who had been there before gushing to his friends about what to order. \u00a0So I get the impression this is one of those start-ups that folks feel strongly about supporting and want to see succeed. Me too.Small portions, but very reasonably priced (most things under $3). \u00a0Spend $8 and you will have a full meal. \u00a0The free chips are unique because they have dark specks in them and seem drier and crunchier than other Mexican restaurants in this genre. The free salsa is excellent.", 
      "WARNING - this restaurant does not operate in a drug-free zone. That is the only thing that explains why they can serve up Mexican food that tastes so good that it is addictive. If the DEA ever raids the place and prevents them from spicing their food with crack, than their food will start to taste like all of the other places that attempt to serve Mexican food. We ate a taco, volcanoes (tostadas), huaraches and carne asada. You could not go wrong with anything they served up. The only downside was the lack of parking. Come prepared to wait for a seat in a small crowded diner or bring a blanket to spread out on the ground outside for a picnic lunch. No matter where you eat, the food is worth the trip.", 
      "Sometimes when something is overhyped, you set yourself up for disappointment. \u00a0I wish I had visited Maize before I had heard anything about it, I think my expectations were too high. After reading reviews, it sounds like the prices have gone up since opening and it is not necessarily a bargain.The parking lot is very small and awkward since it is on the corner of a fairly busy intersection. The staff is super friendly and helpful and will answer any questions you have. If you are short on time, this is a great place to go since the food comes out FAST, unless you have to wait in a huge line to place your order.I tried a fish taco and a pastor tlacoyo, both are items I have not seen on menus at Mexican restaurants around town. They were both very tasty and authentic. The sauce on the pastor tlacoyo was delicious and I was delighted by the authentic cheese and crema topping. \u00a0Chips and salsa were good, but they're not my favorite in town.I would go back and try their torta and any entree that has squash blossom or huitlacoche.", 
      "I finally got around to trying this place, and I'm really glad I did. It was the best steak burrito I've had in town, cheap prices, and they had Mexican coke which is delicious.Just a killer place and has become a regular spot to pick up dinner for me and my lady.", 
      "THE GOOD: It's a cut above your standard mexican food. They serve limes with their dishes and they come hot and fresh. Some different menu items than your typical champaign el toro/terero/etc.THE BAD:I truly believe this place chose such a small venue to give the illusion of a busy restaurant to generate buzz about their business. STAY OR GO?: I would not go back to this place. Mexican tastes ALMOST the same everywhere you go in town. Other places in town you get to sit, be served, and relax (and the price is about the same).", 
      "In the few years I've been on campus, I've been consistently disappointed with what passes for Mexican cuisine around here. That being said, Maize is rocking my world! The food is super-authentic, perfectly fresh and wonderfully inexpensive -- I've eaten there twice in a week! They even have legitimate vegetarian options.I also love the decor. Most of the Mexican places on campus are gross inside, but this place is clean and has a nice vibe. Plus, the folks that own it are incredibly nice.A+++, would/will eat again.", 
      "If you are looking for authentic Mexican food in the CU, this is your place. Be warned, the place is very small, and seating and parking are limited. For me, this isn't a problem, and it just gives it a more intimate authentic hole in the wall atmosphereThe chips and salsa are divine, and free if you dine in. I always get three tacos-- my favorites are asada, chorizo, and chicken. Although I can't speak to the other items on the menu, the food I have had there has tasted so fresh that I wish I went there more. The last major pro-- SUPER CHEAP!", 
      "This is the corner where business comes to die, but I hope this one makes it. As soon as the pedestrian white walls of Ye Olde Donut & BBQ and, more recently, the late Derald's Diner were washed in the much richer brick red paint, the folks across the street at El Charro got off their asses and re-painted their \"Tortas - Tacos - Burritos\" signs. American capitalism at work.Seating is limited at Maize and there are no public bathrooms. It is counter service with about ten barstools.", 
      "There's not much I can add to what other Yelpers have said. \u00a0I've tried most of their item combinations: \u00a0tacos, gorditas, queso, etc. \u00a0 You really can't go wrong with anything here.", 
      "Amazing. \u00a0The rest of the Mexican restaurants in Champaign do not even compare to Maize. \u00a0I got the Volcanes --- truly one of the best dishes I've consumed in a while! The good things about Maize: (1) Maize had fresh ingredients. \u00a0The cilantro tasted like it had just been harvested from a garden this morning. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0Most of the other Mexican restaurants in the area either do not use cilantro or use barely any at all, so Maize's generous serving of fresh cilantro was a definite plus.(2) Maize appeared very sanitary and clean. \u00a0Some the restaurants on campus are somewhat grungy, but this restaurant seemed very well-kept and clean.(3) The decor and music put me in a very good mood. \u00a0From the outside, Maize may look a bit drab, but once you are inside, it's bright and colorful. I kind of wish the place were bigger and had more parking, but I don't really think it's a huge deal. \u00a0The small size of the restaurant gives it \"character.\"", 
      "This place is so small they have less than one table. \u00a0But it's worth squeezing in. In a nutshell, it's the kind of amazing Mexican place that I remember from my youth in California. I never thought I'd find anything like it in the midwest. \u00a0After eating at Maize I may never be able to eat at another mexican place in Champaign-Urbana -- they all compare so poorly to this one. \u00a0Beware, once you eat here there's no going back!I have tried the fancier and more exotic fillings on the menu (the pumpkin flower and the mushroom) and the more authentic formats for them (huaraches, taco mexico) and they were all good, but I liked the \"standards\" even better. If I were you, I'd start with the simplest: tacos pastor with cilantro and onions. Amazing! \u00a0Just amazing.", 
      "Deliciously filling tacos. \u00a0I was hesitant to try it but after expressing my gluten \"allergy\" they seemed receptive to my request for the cook to change gloves before making my food. \u00a0I've had no issues with gluten contamination with the tacos (corn tortillas) or the chips and salsa. \u00a0Its definitely a local favorite and always packed so calling in carry-out is a great option!", 
      "Arguably some of the best, well made and most authentic Mexican food you will get in Champaign and maybe even the state.I'd like to recommend something but with how awesome everything on the menu is, you can't go wrong. \u00a0The chalupas are delicious meat pockets, the tostadas expansive and the burritos are a deal at what they charge. \u00a0My favorite 1-2 punch is getting a burrito and quesadilla and eating the quesadilla late at night.Dining in can be kind of a chore as the place seriously fits about twelve people (not comfortably) but their takeout is fast and if you are a lazy repeat customer (like me), phone ordering takes less than a minute. \u00a0Add in the politeness of the staff and now you know why I eat here at least once a week...", 
      "Maize Mexican Grill is by far the best Mexican food in Champaign-Urbana. It is the only Mexican place that does not taste as if the food just got re-heated in the microwave. While they are not as cheap the other Mexican places in town, the quality by far trumps the cost and quantity you would receive at other places. I have tried a variety of their items. I really like their fish tacos and veggie burritos. The sopes are very delicious as well. Also, the hot and mild sauces that come with the tortilla chips are very good. As stated in all the other reviews, this place is very small and have limited (3) parking spots, making it very hard to obtain food when you have a craving for it. You can always call in your order for pick-up but there is still the issue of finding parking to go pick you food up. What I would suggest is they get a FOOD TRUCK that is goes around campus town, where they make some real bank. Despite this big negative of space and parking, the food makes for a worthwhile trip.", 
      "Great prices, tasty food and decent service for such a small little building and staff. Bilingual, too, which is great. They were good about bringing chips and a drink while I waited only about 5 minutes for my meal.", 
      "I've only stopped in for carry-out once, so maybe I need to try something else on the menu. I have to assume I'm missing something for this place to be getting such rave reviews. I am a taco fiend and wasn't impressed, especially with the fantastic El Charro being right down the street. I ordered two of their \"Taco Mexica\" with chicken, because I'd heard good things about their \"grilled cheese taco.\" The chicken was shredded and barely had any taste to it, which docks major points in my book. There was basically no seasoning in the meat at all, which is why El Charro wins the chicken taco contest by a landslide. The grilled cheese taco thing was interesting, but I honestly couldn't taste the cheese much, and I covet my cheese, so again, I didn't love it. \u00a0The traditional cilantro and onions topping gave it props in my book, but without tasty meat, what's the point? Maybe their beef is the way to go. They include free chips and salsa with your order, and here again I was disappointed. (I'm such a jerk judging free food, aren't I?) The salsa just wasn't my style. I'm basically obsessed with the tomatoey, cilantro-filled stuff El Toro will dole out for free, and I just can't get into spicy traditional salsa. That's a personal preference, though.The guacamole looked really good, but it was mighty expensive. It's $5.95 served with chips, and you get a giant saucer of it, but El Toro serves up some great guac at only $3.50. (And of course you get free chips and salsa at El Toro.)I might go back only to try out their fish tacos and guac, just to give the place one more shot. Good fish tacos is the only thing C-U is missing as far as Mexican food goes.", 
      "Had the asada tlycao here very good for afternoon but not too filling. The tlycao comes with a special sour cream and a taco with black beans processed into the taco itself which is quite tasty. The tylcao was good and we got seats so that was a plus. Better though for takeout.", 
      "Delightfully filling with quality ingredients. Extremely quick service and low price. I HIGHLY recommend eating here!!", 
      "Wow. I've been hearing good things so I decided to do some firsthand research and I must admit, I was worried about walking into a completely empty restaurant. Well, let's just say that by the time I left, the place was packed and for good reason, this is *literally* the best Mexican food you can get in Champaign-Urbana. What I would recommend is the Tacos Mexica which are like regular tacos except there's some grilled brown cheese on there. The cheese adds a bit of saltiness, the browned part adds some crunch and the melty part underneath adds a nice creamy texture to the party. The carne asada is salty and has some nice savory bits from the char of the grill while the pastor is spicy and crunchy.This place is as good as the stuff you'd get at little taquerias on the southside of Chicago so I very highly recommend you stop in.", 
      "Don't get me wrong, the food here is really good, but I just don't think it's amazing like everyone talks about. The guacamole was awesome, but a little pricey in my opinion. Granted, you get a ton of it. Overall, I thought the food was pretty good but didn't live up to the hype.", 
      "Best Mexican food on campus. \u00a0I always get the chorizo and fish tacos. \u00a0Reasonably priced, and free chips with every order. \u00a0The green sauce is awesome.I hope they can keep it up!", 
      "Best and most authentic Mexican in C-U, some of the best Mexican I've ever had, period. (I love RIck Bayless's places in Chicago, I think he'd approve!) Love the Tlacoyo, sopes, and quesadillas. Tortillas are freshly made, with masa, not the prepackaged factory made ones. This is almost impossible to find these days, even in Mexico! CU is lucky! \u00a0Guac is good.. Queso fundido is fantastic. When asked grilled or fried, ask for fried. Trust me.Cons: very small, always packed, only counter top/bar stool seating, which is hard if you have kids or want to go with a group.", 
      "The food is very good. The staff are professional and food is prepared quickly and fresh. I personally enjoy the fish tacos and rib eye tacos, the hand made tortillas really take it to another level. I also like the tostadas with pastor or chorizo, they come with great toppings. And the rice is amazing! Great place for lunch or dinner.", 
      "I am a taco snob! I am fully aware, but this place absolutely lives up to my expectations. I spent the majority of my 20's in Southern Cali so I've definitely done my research when it comes to tacos. The tortillas are made fresh in the kitchen, the meat is well seasoned and the toppings are perfect! I love the Lomo Mexica (not on the menu) which is basically the grilled cheese rib-eye taco. Yasss honey! The steak, fish, pork and chicken are great too (in that order) I have also tried their sopes which are totally yummy, but the tacos are definitely the main event! Stop by when you have time and patience to deal with the lines and limited seating. If I had to state one downside it would be the chips which are nothing to rave about but hey this place is A1!", 
      "Finally went to Maize for the first time today after reading a bunch of reviews online. Maize does live up to its hype. For such a small space, the owner did a great job making this place feel warm and inviting. Seating is cramped and very limited, but I guess Maize is one of those hole-in-a-wall neighborhood restaurants that everyone loves. Food was very fresh and authentic, and everything tasted good. The portion was small, so you're going to have to order a couple of things, but price is reasonable for the quality of food. Service was also very friendly too.Pros: authentic, fresh mexican food. very friendly service. Cons: limited parking and seating.", 
      "Seriously loved this place! I went for lunch last week while I was visiting a friend at U of I - so glad she suggested it! I got chicken tacos and they came with complimentary chips - love that, although I could've used a little more salsa. Since it was free, I can't complain. Tacos were SO GOOD. Very Mexican-street-food kind of tacos. yum yum yum! She got a torta which she said she's had before and loves. This will definitely be a regular place to hit up when I am visiting U of I!Only downside was that we planned on eating there but it was packed so we ended up getting our food to go. Not a huge deal at all", 
      "Best AUTHENTIC \u00a0Mexican food in CU hands down. Super staff. Very clean. Great variety. Super small place", 
      "Looks a little shabby on the outside, fantastic authentic food on the inside. \u00a0We arrived shortly before lunch and by the time our food arrived the place was full and had a line out the door.Delish: talk about flavor! \u00a0Portions might appear on the smaller side (which threw me off, eyes bigger than stomach issue) but very filling. \u00a0I ended up having to bring half of my food home! \u00a0For mushroom lovers: try the huitlacoche!My brother lives in the area - great find broey! \u00a0We'll head back to Maize when we head back to IL for a family visit.Deep friend quesadillas? \u00a0Yeah, I said it. \u00a0Crazy....", 
      "A-MAIZING!! One of the most wonderful casual restaurants in the CU area. You just have to try it!", 
      "I went here with my best friend a few weeks ago. The menu is small and the location is even smaller. As a U of I alumni, I have seen many businesses come and go through this location. It is nice to finally see a business that is showing signs of sticking around. The food is simple and delicious. The service is fast and friendly. No complaints and I will definitely be back.", 
      "Place is great.. Definitely not a place to take a serious date. \u00a0I enjoyed eating and the small dining area made it interesting. \u00a0My wife and I chowed down on everything. \u00a0The guacamole and chips were good and the numerous other items we had were great. \u00a0Make sure you go hungry because you will want to try most of the menu. \u00a0The staff made some great recommendations and everyone were friendly and hospitable.", 
      "After reading all the rave reviews I had to check Maize out and finally this past week I had a chance. \u00a0I ordered for take-out, knowing that it would probably be packed and when I got there it was indeed filled with people. I ordered a handful of items for me and my roommate. \u00a0I got a rib-eye taco, a chorizotaco, and a pastor taco. \u00a0The rib-eye was thinly sliced and was of good quality. \u00a0The grilling gave it a little bit of char and was tasty. \u00a0I did feel that it was a bit underseasoned and could have used a touch more salt. \u00a0The chorizo taco had your standard ground chorizo, but was delicious. \u00a0The pastor taco was the best of the three, great flavor and a touch of heat. \u00a0As others have mentioned the tortillas are handmade and they're fantastic. \u00a0A bit chewier than your typical store bought tortilla and adds an element of texture to their dishes. \u00a0My roommate got a fish taco, a carne asada taco, and a grilled chicken quesadilla. \u00a0He seemed to enjoy everything as well, but don't have much commentary beyond that. \u00a0 Definitely a place worth visiting regularly, seeing that their prices are low and the food is great.", 
      "Hands down best Mexican food in the Champaign/Urbana area. Everything is very authentic and the recipes are straight from a little town in Mexico. The quality of the meat is superb and they cook everything just right. I highly recommend the Volcanes because they are very unique and flavorful. The best meat is the pastor. You cannot find pastor this good anywhere around here. They marinate it just right. The staff is very kind and provide great service.", 
      "Absolutely delicious! I had the steak huarache, and loved it. Their horchata is also great (not to sweet). Only downside to this place is the size, however, you can take out. All in all, one of the best Mexican food places in Champaign.", 
      "Superb Mexican food !!", 
      "I came here for lunch on Friday. \u00a0It was pretty quiet- only a couple other people eating. \u00a0I had the chicken quesadilla and what was supposed to be a carne asada taco with no onions. \u00a0Prices were fairly low and the food came rather quickly. \u00a0First off, they messed up my order as the taco wasn't carne asada. \u00a0Then when I sent it back and it returned, the meat was carne asada, but was covered in onions. \u00a0By this point, I was over it, so I didn't bother to send it back a third time- just didn't eat it. \u00a0I was expecting more from this place because of all of the rave reviews. \u00a0To be honest, my quesadilla was really oily (on the outside!) and extremely bland. It was missing heat, spice, anything to liven up the taste. \u00a0Overall, I wasn't too impressed and doubt I'll be back. It just wasn't all that.", 
      "I have been here three times now, eating there once and twice to-go, so I will point out my favorite things. I have ordered the Chorizo burrito twice and steak burrito the other. Each time it was cooked wonderfully and topped with fresh produce. In addition, chips were included in the price of the burrito. The chips came with two small servings of what appeared to be homemade-salsa. I didn't try it, so I can not comment on it. Each time the order was under $5 which was extremely reasonable for the meal. Service was great and I enjoyed a nice conversation with the owner while I waited. You are also able to see into the kitchen, which appeared to be very clean. Finally, my last visit, I noticed they had implemented a new point-of-sale system. This was nice to see, as it improved order time, as well as I like seeing owners reinvest in their businesses. My only complaints would be minimal parking if you were thinking of driving and that it can often be crowded with limited seating areas. Overall, I would give it a 5/5 for its excellent tasting food and friendly service.", 
      "Excellent food, excellent value. Favorite Mexican place. Order huaraches with chorizo and you won't be disappointed. My bf likes the corn fungus in a fried quesadilla - I'll pass. Chips are various salsas are also delicious and different. The only downside is that it's small and can be crowded, but it's worth the wait!To the people comparing this place to El Toro and Dos Reales - really? You've go to be kidding. The chicken tacos are a little bland, I will say that.", 
      "Not much else to say that others haven't already said.... the food here is spectacular (and not just \"spectacular for central Illinois\" ... I mean actually really good). If you just get the burrito every time, you are really missing out. Yes, it's usually packed, but it's busy for a reason. If you call in for takeout, the food will be ready before you can even get there, so what are you waiting for?!", 
      "Seriously the best mexican food I've ever had. And I've had a TON of authentic mexican, in America and beyond. All you need to know is that this place is legitimately the best mexican food you will ever eat. Personal favorite is steak tacos. UNREAL people. I can't say enough about how much I love Maize!!!!"

      "The guacamole. The carne asada gorditas. The pumpkin flower fried quesadilla. All unbelievably good. Every time I eat there I leave full and spend so little money. Keep it up Maize! You are helping change the food scene in CU!", 
      "College spot; the menu is not Taco Bell, so if your Spanish is limited (like mine) you better ask questions!", 
      "This is a little hidden gem with the best Mexican food in town. \u00a0The place is very small and cramped, and there is often a line out the door. \u00a0However, the tacos de carne asada (steak tacos) are to die for - made with corn tortillas, cilantro and onions, just the way they are supposed to be. \u00a0The burritos are passable, but stick with the tacos if you want rather authentic Mexican food. \u00a0The price is not the cheapest compared to say, Dos Reales (another decent Mexican place in town), you do not get any sides and the drinks do not come with refills. \u00a0However, it is definitely more authentic. \u00a0Dining in at this place might feel rushed since it is so small - best get your food to go.", 
      "Saw all the good reviews but was deterred by small seating area and parking lot, finally went there twice this week. I think the food is quite good but maybe a notch below expectation from the reviews. Very friendly staff and reasonable prices. Will go again.", 
      "Maize, what can I say about you? It was love at first bite.This is authentic Mexican food in Champaign. The chicken, fish, and ground beef burritos are amazing. The ground beef, chicken, and chorizo tacos are great. The volcano taco is fantastic. Catch my drift? And free chips with any order...what more could you ask for?Well if you want to get specific, my only complaint would be that the place is small and so is the parking lot (5 spots maybe?). It's always crowded, but always worth the wait. Call and place your order in advance so you can skip the line.", 
      "This place is fabulous. The food is fresh and deliciously seasoned. The prices are very reasonable, especially in comparison to all the other Mexican places in town, and the decor is cheerful and clean. I would highly recommend the Sope al pastor cooked on el comal (not fried). And the tlacoyo was also delicious. Husband had a burrito al pastor, which he loved. They give you free chips and homemade salsa. We both left feeling full and happy.The owners are very kind and personable. I will definitely go back again.", 
      "This place is tiny, which often leads to tricky parking situations and lines out the door, but don't be dissuaded! Everything I've tried has been fresh and flavorful, and absolutely not drowning in grease (which is often my complaint when it comes to Mexican food, particularly in the midwest). My current favorites are the guacamole, veggie chalupas, and pumpkin flower quesadillla. I'm slowly working my way through the veggie and fish menu as I return and return again, snacking on the complimentary chips and adding delicious warm salsa to all of the selections. Yum!Lately I've been calling for take-out more often because the logistics of getting to Maize and finding space are not always easy... and so I would love if it could expand a bit and get some better bike / car parking. (Bike rack, please?) But that doesn't seem to be worth knocking off a star -- and other than that, I wouldn't want them to change anything.", 
      "Yes, this place is small, but the food is flavorful. \u00a0Very fast and affordable. \u00a0I'd recommend the steak burrito and chicken flautas. \u00a0Why eat fast food (Taco Bell) when you can eat here?", 
      "I expected MUCH more for the 4.5 stars. \u00a0Had asada flautas. \u00a0Below average at best. \u00a0Chips and salsa were average at best. \u00a0Sitting area is too small. \u00a0Would not return.", 
      "The food is really expensive. They won't let you have different types of flautas in one order. The steak in the flautas is too big so when you bite into the flauta the whole chunk of meat comes out and you are left with a gross hollow thing. I ordered queso fundito, and it was a solid hard thing, not a dip, yet it came with chips? It was like solid, with the pumpkin flowers sandwiched in the middle. They didn't warn us that the prices had gone up when we ordered ahead on the phone. There's nowhere to park. It has a teeny tiny eating area. It's right on campus, so it's overly crowded all day. The good thing is if you order guacamole you get a TON of it.", 
      "Hard to find for out-of-towners. It's across the street from Dominos on Green St. \u00a0Decently fast service - took just under 10 minutes to get 2 tacos and a deep fried quesadilla (say it like Napoleon Dynamite's grandma). The tacos are somewhat authentic w/ cilantro / lime / onion. \u00a0They put mayonnaise (interesting) on under the meat on the tortilla, but it was hardly tasted. My big complaint is the tacos and quesadilla were extremely dry. \u00a0They have two salsas - an orange and yellow colored salsa. \u00a0The salsa tasted good on the chips, but not good enough or complimentary for the entree. \u00a0The girl who took everyone's order was very nice so customer service was good. \u00a0Lastly, the restaurant only seats 12-14 people (elbow to elbow) so eat out if you wish. \u00a0 Ultimately I would not eat here again, but if you read other reviews and decide I'm off my rocker, take it to go and buy an extra bottle of water because your mouth will be dry after eating.", 
      "Best place to eat on campus by far. Authentic food, lots of taste. If you haven't been there, you are missing out.The guacamole is incredible. My favorite things to get are sopes and tlacoyo. Get them fried, trust me.", 
      "Absolutely delicious food. \u00a0Huge portions. \u00a0Cheap prices.The only downside - it's constantly packed with college kids, and the extremely limited space is quickly overflowing with ugg boots and axe body spray. \u00a0Get your order to go.", 
      "Best Mexican food on campus!", 
      "I lived in California and have visited Mexico several times. \u00a0The Maize grill has the most authentic south of the border flavors I have ever encountered in the States. \u00a0I had the torta and tried a regular taco, both with Carne asada. \u00a0All I can say is that they were absolutely delicious. \u00a0Can't wait to go back.Don't expect any ambiance, though. \u00a0There are only about 12 - 15 counter seats available. \u00a0The food makes up for it. \u00a0And, show up early for lunch, because they have a tendency to fill up rather quickly.", 
      "Best Mexican in town, perhaps the best inexpensive Mexican I've had anywhere. \u00a0Yes, it's cramped, parking can be difficult, including getting out at the corner -- but it's worth it. \u00a0Chips + verde salsa (I think you have to ask for the verde) are great. \u00a0Fish tacos are best in town. \u00a0Love the chorizo burrito -- so good I'm willing to suffer the upset stomach. \u00a0(The price I pay for any chorizo.)Always friendly even \u00a0when it's a little chaotic in there. \u00a0Wish they would expand and wouldn't mind having a margarita with my meal. \u00a0Hoping.", 
      "Great new place. The food was very fresh and light, but incredibly filling. I got a chicken burrito, while my husband got two tacos and a chicken quesadilla (the tacos and quesadilla were small-ish, but made a great meal together).Will definitely be back again! I think this may become a regular carry-out for us. Too small to go to with a group, but great as a grab-and-go meal.As for the parking - I recommend using the meters across the street behind Domino's. Waaaaay easier to get in and out of than the tiny parking lot by the restaurant.", 
      "Tostadas, I'm such a fan of their pastor tostadas. The wait and limited seating make it kind of a pain though. So I suggest calling in and ordering for pick up.", 
      "Yes, Authentic Mexican food that is oh so affordable. They even have pumpkin flower and huitlacoche tlacoyos. Try them and you won't regret it!", 
      "Carne Asada tacos - possibly the best I have ever had. \u00a0The homemade tortillas are amazing with the queso fundido as well as with the tacos! \u00a0The other yelpers are right that it is a tiny place with just counter seating - but it's worth it! \u00a0The staff was extremely friendly as well! \u00a0Probably not the best place for kids though as it's a more adult taste.", 
      "Great Mexican Food!", 
      "Best addition to Chambana Mexican food life! They need to find a bigger place to accommodate the demand that I anticipate.", 
      "I ate there for the first time last week, and it was fantastic. I got there early to beat the lines and actually got a seat inside. I really cant think of any criticisms. I can't remember the name of what i ordered, but I do remember that it came on a perfect flour tortilla grilled to perfection. The meat was extremely tasty, and the onions and cilantro made it perfect. Plus, the prices were amazing. I'd recommend them to any of my friends.", 
      "My favorite restaurant in CU I recommend the volcanes. They're like a tostada but with this nice grilled melted cheese on the tostada shell.My bf (from mx) loves their tortas ahogadas and says he feels like he's back in mexico when we go there.I love their beautiful tile counter/bar with tiles from mexico. :)", 
      "Finally, a place on green and first that is good! i think i have tried everything on teh menu. This is the most legit mexican food in town. Get the chalupas! It's the best deal. You get 3 chalupas for 4.99 (ish). Other good things to get are tacos and tostadas. \u00a0if you get a torta, get ready to bring home leftovers because that thing is huge!The meat here could use a bit of salt and pepper. also, don't bother to get the fancy steak taco or fish taco because they dont taste that great. otherwise, everything is delicious!", 
      "This is a small establishment with about 5 parking spots. There are about 16 counter seats. \u00a0We ordered Carne Asada and Fish Tacos (around $3 per) which were both tasty and not too greasy. We were recommended another open faced item on fried dough which was great as well. Chips and Salsa were offered as we waited for our tacos. The food was tasty/fresh, service was efficient, and overall a positive experience. Whoever was running the cashier was super patient, had a genuine smile, and was very calm even when it was busy (which seems like the line is always out the door). Can't wait to go back!", 
      "Fantastic service in such a small but cozy diner-esque place. \u00a0The food was really good, with soft corn tortillas a fresh ingredients. \u00a0If you dine in, they also provide fresh homemade salsas and chips. \u00a0Food was just a tad underseasoned for me but the fast and friendly yet unobtrusive service definitely more than made up for it. \u00a0Check them out!", 
      "The best and most authentic mexican food in Champaign!", 
      "Best Mexican around. \u00a0Might actually be one of the best restaurants around. \u00a0Almost everything is done from-scratch and the tiny dining area serves for a cool/different atmosphere.", 
      "Excellent place. Always crowdy, but they are very quick in service. I always try a different dish when I go there, and not a single dish has failed my expectation yet :-)", 
      "Excellent and authentic in every way. \u00a0Don't mind the size of the place of the wait, it is all worth it. \u00a0I wish they were bigger, but lets not mess with perfection!", 
      "This is a VERY good mexican restaurant. \u00a0 I've been meaning to come here for several months, but based on the reviews, I decided to wait when school was out and campustown would be empty. \u00a0 The parking lot is SMALL. \u00a0 I mean like, 6 parking spots maybe.... so either get their early or park on the street somewhere and walk on over. \u00a0 The restaurant is a little hole in the wall ex-diner/donut shop.... seating is super-limited.... again, maybe like 10 seats.... so your best bet is to probably eat in your car or on the curb. \u00a0 The prices are very reasonable.... you'll fill yourself up easily for $10. \u00a0 I got three tacos -- al pastor, fish and a rib eye. \u00a0 They were authentic -- cilantro and onions... corn tortillas. \u00a0 I could've eaten about 6 of them easily. \u00a0The rib eye was good, the al pastor was better and the fish was outstanding! \u00a0 I got complimentary chips and salsas while I waited. They were good.... but not sure how fresh they were since they were already warming under the heat lamps when I sat down. \u00a0 This is a GREAT Mexican restaurant.... but not sure if it's really worth venturing into campustown to MAYBE get a seat AND a parking spot. \u00a0 You definitely don't want to be lugging around a baby in a baby carrier because they'll just wind up sitting next to you on the floor (limited space) --- I mean, like stretch your arms out to your side and that's probably the size of the dining space width-wise. \u00a0 \u00a0Don't even think about bringing a toddler here because again, they won't be able to sit still on the chairs for very long. \u00a0 But if you're by yourself or with a small party, go for it!Other than that, there are other alternatives in town that are just as good (ok, no other place has fish tacos like these, but for other mexican fare, there are good alternatives) such as Taco Loco, the taco trucks (the Mas Amigos at Prospect and Bloomington, and whateveritscalled Taco Truck in the Springfield and County Fair Dr \u00a0area).", 
      "Everything was tasty. \u00a0The salsas are great, very fresh! \u00a0We got our order to go, parking is VERY limited which was ok when it was a donut place (you're in and out) but maybe not so great for a restaurant. \u00a0 Prices are very reasonable, filling food and friendly staff. \u00a0My only real complaint is that the vegetarian options are kind of limited. \u00a0Sure they list veggie as an option for most items, but don't order it thinking you're going to get a taco or sope or huarache with grilled veggies instead of meat. \u00a0You'll basically get the item with NO MEAT, just the toppings listed, even though you pay the same price as one with meat. \u00a0I'd love it if they added some grilled veggies so at least it seems like a vegetarian option instead of an afterthought.", 
      "Amazing New Mexican Restaurant!I hadn't heard about Maize, just saw it pop up on First and Green where during my 4 years here on campus I've seen many establishments come and simply disappear. Me and my roommate (all mexican) went to try it highly suspicious that any place around here could actually offer authentic mexican cuisine. Boy were we wrong. This place is great! It does everything right, taco, quesadillas, huaraches, and even tortas. It's the level of authenticity you might expect from a place like Nuevo Leon. I wish they just had more seating and were able to offer a dinner type atmosphere and menu. Great lunch and cheap dinner food. They are missing a lot of dinner items such as \u00a0enchiladas, mole, or pozole. However, everything they do do, they do it right. Their salsas are great, their tortillas delicious. Everything has the perfect amount of grease. Seasoning could be better, but it's better that they under salt than over salt. . Definitely try this place out!", 
      "Best Mexican food I have ever had from a restaurant. \u00a0Period.", 
      "I'm changing this review after thinking it over. The food is REALLY good, and they're super nice! Even though the space is small, that's not a reason to take off a star because this place is thee best in Champaign, and closely competing with some great spots in other cities/states as well!", 
      "this place is a hidden gem in champaign. arguably the best mexican food in town. salsa is awesome and tortas are just right. i haven't gotten anything that has tasted bad there.parking is quite difficult during peak hours, but it makes the atmosphere that much better.", 
      "Only authentic mexican food in Champaign. It is a little cramped, but the food is absolutely incredible. I can't wait for the new one to open up where the cafe luna used to be. If you are looking for great food at an affordable price, look no further than Maize.", 
      "Fantastic hole-in-the-wall authentic Mexican place. Indoor seating is a little cramped but the food is fantastic and fresh. The quac is pricey but excellent. Would definitely recommend", 
      "I absolutely loved it here. The food was so good and it actually tasted like real Mexican food. The rice water was also very good. I would totally recommend this place!! Minus the fact that it's so small in there."

      "A strong addition to the relatively unimpressive community of campus restaurants. \u00a0Had the flautas and steak tacos. \u00a0Almost as good as La Pasadita in Chicago. \u00a0Efficient for the small size of the place. \u00a0Will return.", 
      "I was really happy when mas amigos opened because im from california and i like tacos \u00a0this is The best Mexican food in town by a long shot. \u00a0If you're against dairy you're going to have some problems cause pretty much everything is covered in nice fresh cotija crumbly cheese and slightly sour and delicious crema which I love but could be bad for the lactose intolerant.", 
      "The tacos are so good at this place I don't know how I'm ever going to try anything else on the menu! Taco Mexicana, hands down the best thing ever. I love carne asada even though it's a bit greasy but not in a sickening way. They load these tacos with fresh onions and cilantro so you can taste the stuff for hours to come. Heheh. I love all the salsas they have for the chips as well. It's a causal diner and the service is just right. I will go back again and again until I'm completely tired of the tacos. Maybe only then I'll be able to finally try something else!", 
      "Food=5 starsSize of restaurant=2 stars, it's tiny!! :( Don't let that scare you though! (Word on the street is that they're moving to a bigger location though? Don't quote me, that's just a rumor I heard)I've been here twice and each time I've thought the same thing- The food tastes so FRESH. \u00a0Especially the guacamole. I live in Normal and I told my fiance that I would drive the 50 minutes to the restaurant just to eat and come home. I love it that much.Big portions. Decent prices. If you want proper Mexican, go here.", 
      "You know you've found a good deal when you see undergrads lined up out the door. \u00a0I don't know how this place turns a profit at the prices they charge. \u00a0I got two items, both under $3 each, and they gave free chips and salsa (good and spicy salsa at that) with my order. \u00a0Their chorizo is excellent and all the ingredients tasted really fresh. \u00a0It's impressive seeing the waitstaff team go to work during rush hour, running with the speed, friendliness and efficiency of a championship McDonalds staff.", 
      "Excellent food and great staff. Small space to eat, but the chips and salsa make it an ideal place in Champaign! \u00a0I had the chicken and carne asada tacos and they were great!", 
      "Best Mexican in town, and very reasonably priced. I only wish there was more seating! My favorite is the chicken tostada. If you get takeout, be aware that they are VERY generous with the guacamole- it probably serves 2 or 3 people and is priced fairly for that amount.", 
      "I went to Maize for the first time today for lunch; all I can say is AWESOME! Fantastic, authentic, Mexican fare with homemade tortillas, homemade salsa, and flavorful meats and fresh toppings. I loved the chicken, asada, and pastor tacos all equally, and can't wait to go back and try more!", 
      "Delicious!!!!! Good price, excellent food!", 
      "As good as Mexican food gets in Champaign! I like the al pastor and steak tacos. There torta is also delicious! Oh and the salsas are great! Best horchata in town too!", 
      "This place saved me. I struggled to find a good authentic Mexican restaurant near campus. The burritos and tacos are outstanding, and the presentation - complete with lime wedges and two types of salsa - makes for a wonderful experience. There is not much seating, but if you order and wait a moment you're sure to find a spot at the counter or at the window.", 
      "Coming from CA, we were generally happy with this place except the lack of a truly spicy salsa. \u00a0We'll give it another shot soon, though!", 
      "The food was pretty tasty but I feel the portions were really small for Mexican food. I know it's more authentic but I like the more Americanized Mexican food with bigger portions. I eat a lot so I don't know if that's why I don't get full but you can definitely get bigger portions elsewhere.", 
      "Awesome food. This little place just sprung up a few months ago, and it looks like it is here to stay (I sure hope so at least). Maize always seems like it is busy, so I decided to try it out. Great food. I like how the burritos are prefect sized - I can eat one without feeling stuffed (unlike a Chipotle burrito, not that that is bad though). Really friendly staff, and a small bag of Chips and salsa comes with every order. The inside is small though, so if you walk in and order, be prepared to wait a little (less than 10 mins though) in a small space!I used to be an El Charro fan, but since Maize moved in I haven't gone since... and I haven't really missed it either.Pros: Great food. Decent prices. Friendly staff. Chips and salsa with every order. Orders don't take long (I can call an order in and by the time I walk over it will be ready!)Cons: Small location, not a whole lot of room to wait around for your order or to sit down and eat. Really busy sometimes.", 
      "This place is good. I got a huarache with squash flowers the first time, and a chicken burrito the second. Both times the food was super fresh, and the base for the huarache was home-made I think. A friend mentioned that they forget to add salt...that might be what is missing? Also, I like really hot salsas and theirs are extremely mild. I would say the taco truck at Bradley and Prospect is my first favorite for Mexican food here, and Maize is my second favorite. Then maybe the Mexican grocery on Green is my third favorite.", 
      "This place is amazing. Best Mexican on campus, forget El Charro, even on wednesdays. The homemade salsas are amazing. I always have the same order, 3 tacos: chorizo, pastor, carne asada.My only drawback is a decrease in quality with the high volume. Food amounts can be variable, but their dining room is tiny, and the line always out the door.I'll be back many times next year in champaign.", 
      "Really good Mexican restaurant. It is always packed. The food is really authentic. The menu is small but it has a lot of stuff to try out. You can't go wrong with this place.", 
      "Great staff, great service,great food. Take out because its a small place and they are fairly quick about orders.", 
      "BEST TACO PLACE ON CAMPUS. If they delivered, it would probably be the greatest thing to happen to the UIUC area. \u00a0But in all seriousness, their meat is great, the tacos are always very well filled, and it comes with free chips.", 
      "Yes, it's very good food. Yes, they have lots of great choices. Yes, it is authentic mexican food in the middle of Illinois.But, it's always packed and they are continually raising their prices. It was once extremely cheap and I went there a lot. But now I prefer Huaraches Moroleon for better food, better prices, and a better atmosphere. Maize is still delicious though.",

It doesn't take long to get your food either, very quick.",

      "Authentic and tasty, no question. Enjoyed a burrito con al pastor, which had that lively, slightly sweet flavor. It was excellent and plenty large. The salsa is clearly made in house and is also delicious (and comes with the meal, I might add). As good as Mexican gets in CU. Here's to hoping the steady volume of traffic I've noted driving by (and visiting the once) continues.", 
      "Tried Maize for the first time about a month ago and it was good. Tortillas are made fresh so that is amazing. They ribeye steak tacos are extremely tender and the fish tacos have excellent flavor. Wish the place had more sitting space though. Chicken tacos were a bit bland but the salsa verde adds great spice for them.", 
      "Okay, my credentials: I lived in LA for 5 years, which has probably the best Mexican food in America. \u00a0My favorite taco place is Tacos El Gordo in San Diego, which has 559 (559!) yelp reviews and 4.5 stars; I raved about that place 3 years ago before it blew up. I like lengua, sesos, suadero, barbacoa, al pastor, asada, tripas, carnitas, and buche. I like tacos with pickled radishes and carrots served from trucks parked under LA overpasses late at night.Maize Mexican Grill is seriously legit. Hand rollled tortillas. Huitlacoche. Huaraches. Rib-eye tacos! The fish quesadilla is incredible: it's a hand rolled tortilla filled with cheese and fish, perfectly deep fried with a delicate crispy outside, a soft doughy tortilla inside.The atmosphere is awesome, too. At once bright and airy, and cozy too. Sit at the counter and you can't help but talk with Armando, the owner, and your fellow diners about the food coming out. It's more of a foodie community than just a restaurant.Pro-tip: if you have the time, when you get to order tell Armando that you're in his hands and you'll have whatever he decides to send out. Sit at the counter an be ready to be very happy and very full.", 
      "If you haven't been to Maize, the question is why? \u00a0Fantastic food! Quesadillas, volcanes, tacos, tlacoyo, nachos - all so good! It is really mostly a carry out joint, so I don't fault them for limited space at all. Better to start out small, grow a reputation - than look for a big space to begin with.", 
      "If you have read my other reviews, you know that I would just about eat anywhere if the food was good. \u00a0Yes, Maize is teeny-tiny and I even get grouchy trying to squeeze in but it is so worth it! \u00a0The food is SO cheap and delicious! \u00a0I am super picky when it comes to Mexican and I didn't even want to go when my boyfriend suggested it but I am glad we did. \u00a0The fish tacos are my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE! \u00a0Would definitely recommend to anyone!",

The interior was rather cheerful and clean. There was a strange buzz about the place with everyone either awaiting or devouring their food while engaged in happy conversation with their family and friends. Despite the shoddy exterior and sheer lack of seating pace, there place possess a warm and inviting feel. \u00a0The food itself is VERY reasonably priced to start with, which to a college student like me is always a plus. The ingredients were fresh and you could easily tell that the food was made to order. My group was first served the complementary chips and salsa, and the freshness of the salsas just shone through. I ordered a vegetarian Torta Ahogada made spicy. I am a sucker for very spicy food, and my oh my was my palate for once was satisfied on this front. It was flavorful and very filling. All in all, Maize offers Mexican food in a less cliched and entirely authentic way. It offers not only freshness of ingredients, but also fantastic value. Of course, the place wasn't designed to ever give people a satisfactory seating experience, but the food more than makes up for it. An A+ from yours truly.", 
      "I don't understand why everyone is ranting and raving about this place. I went solely because of all the fantastic reviews, but I was incredibly disappointed! Is it absolutely terrible? No. Is it the best Mexican food out there? Not even close.I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 1 chicken taco. When I unwrapped my food, I was disappointed to see 3 puney little tacos. They look like tacos you'd order off of some sort of kids meal. However, I'll admit I was wrong about the sizing because they were incredibly filling! At first I didn't even think 3 would fill me, but just 2 and the chips and salsa they give you with every order left my stomach full.So maybe something is wrong with my taste buds, but these were the most bland tacos I've ever had. Probably one of the most bland things I've ever tasted period! I started with the carne asada tacos. Although it was loaded with meat, I could not taste the meat whatsoever. I felt like I was eating an onion and cilantro taco (the only other ingredients on them). Although the cilantro is very fresh and tasty and the onion gives it a good kick, I did not pay for a cilantro and onion on a tortilla...Then I thought maybe it was just the carne asada that isn't their expertise, so I moved on to the chicken taco. Just as bland! It's not even that the cilantro and onion are overpowering, the meat just has absolutely no flavor to is. I don't understand how meat can be that bland. Even unseasoned meat isn't that flavorless.The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I can't speak for everything on the menu. However, that being said, I don't plan on trying anything else on the menu. Sorry, but Maize isn't for me.", 
      "Great mexican cuisine! \u00a0Its simply excellent. \u00a0The only neg is that its small, but for good food and great service one has to suffer a bit :-)", 
      "UPDATE: after eating here 10+ times since my initial review, I really like this place. Their tacos are excellent, as are their gorditias.", 
      "It's cheap. But I don't like cheese. The chili sauce is nice."

      "Between 6 hungry people, we ordered:1) Indonesian Fried Rice2) Crispy Beef3) Crispy Tofu4) Chicken Lo Mein5) MaPo TofuPlatters are around $7 each and everything is cooked fresh to order. The flavors are amazing here and the service is amazing, the food comes out quickly. \u00a0It's feel-good, home-away-from-home cooking. \u00a0It's no wonder there's always a lot of international students and a few home-grown midwesterners eating here - they've discovered one of the best spots for Asian food in Champaign. \u00a0(And the engineering quad is also right across the street!)It's not a fancy place. \u00a0You'll clean your own plates when you're finished and when you order, you'll be given a number which they will call out from the counter. \u00a0You can grab your own silverware, napkins and cups of water/tea from the big kettles near the cash register and clear your own dishes when you're finished. \u00a0But what they lack in pomp and panache they make up for with good food and cheerful service. \u00a0Simple as that.If I had to choose to order one thing consistenlty, it would be their crispy tofu. \u00a0Hefty wedges of soft tofu are lightly breaded and fried. \u00a0It's served topped with strings of fresh green onion and this incredible thick garlic dipping sauce, which I would eat with plain rice. \u00a0It's that good! \u00a0And it's my favorite.The Indonesian Fried Rice comes with a fried egg on top and their MaPo Tofu comes spicy (chilis bring it on), in a very sharable portion. \u00a0Our dishes also came with the soup of the day, something along the lines of egg drop soup with tomotoes. \u00a0Here you will get an affordable meal with amazing Taiwanese-Indonesian-Chinese flavors.When i was a student here, I would mostly order take-out and the portions would last me at least two meals. \u00a0Come here if you want a filling, hearty meal that will nourish your heart and soul. \u00a0Dining in is great to eat family style since the dishes are shareable. \u00a0If you come consistently enough, I think you'll find your favorite dish that you'll want to order every time. \u00a0The owners are incredible people who take great pride in their restaurant. \u00a0They know they are a beloved spot on campus and treat their patrons in the same way.", 
      "My second take-out Chinese experience in Chabana while here at school, and it wasn't much better than the first. My roommates and I decided to order from Cravings after realizing the Golden Harbor might be too expensive. This was probably a bad decision as we had moved from probably middle tier Chinese to low tier Chinese food in terms of price and quality.The General Tso's chicken was just OK, I've had better and it honestly more resembled orange chicken in both taste and looks.Others got a beef dish and a seafood combination which was on the Chinese menu. I had no clue many of these restaurants have Chinese menus that are often more authentic and probably better quality and tasting than the regular menus. I need to order off those menus and not the Americanized ones for future reference.The fried rice was pretty bland as well. Eggrolls not very good, either.They forgot to include a side order of crab Rangoon and when we called back they said next time we are in the Rangoon will be free. I wasn't impressed with the food but in all fairness it was like $6.50 for a large portion so at least I wasn't hungry afterwards.I still want to try some of the other Chinese places in Champaign as well as ordering off the non-Americanized menus. I think the cuisine is interesting but the quality just hasn't been there at the last couple places I've tried.", 
      "Well, almost exactly one year later, I've revisited Cravings as my first lunch after coming back to CU. While the points I made last time about the interior still stand, I did try the Jakarta fried rice, and it was quite good! Good enough to bump this up to 4 stars, but alas, I had some bad service this time around. A mistake was made when putting in my order, so I ended up having to wait 20 minutes for my food. I couldn't even sit down to wait since all the tables were full. Ack! Just 3 stars then...P.S. Excessive use of styrofoam - cups, takeaway boxes, and bowls for small soups, all in styrofoam.", 
      "Cravings used to be our go-to lunch spot for Chinese food on campus. Food are not exactly authentic nor delicate, but there are some nice choices (e.g., eggplant beef stew, fish fillets with spicy tofu sauce); portions are big and price is cheap; and the owner is super funny. However, their food is not always fresh, and like another reviewer said, \u00a0they had failed food safety inspections so many times that they were close to being shut down.One star because my husband went there again this evening and got food poisoning and got VERY SICK. Lesson learned and just wanted to caution everybody. Would be three stars for the good memories...", 
      "Food is salty as hell. 3 stars only because the owner there is chill as hell. Food definitely went downhill. It's still cheap fast food if you really like salt.", 
      "Homie, this place is great but sometimes it's just closed unexpectedly. Sometimes I'll go by and it's just not open when it usually is and other times it's closed for a \"health violation\" or something like that.", 
      "First time in Champaign, IL and I went to my trusty Yelp app to find a tasty place for dinner. After reading the reviews for Craving, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, the summer hours aren't updated on Yelp and the place was closed early on Sunday night. Oh well, Monday night, I returned and boy, was I glad I did.This place is about as dive as you can get. But we all know, good Chinese restaurants are all about the food...so I dove into the menu. I was happy to see they had a \"Chinese\" menu for the real authentic dishes. I ordered the mushroom and tofu curry. It came with a small bowl of seaweed soup and rice. Extra rice was free (which is always should be!) as was the hot tea and ice cold water. The curry and the soup were both delicious.I returned the next time to try their famous hot and spicy chicken. WOW! The servings are enormous. There is a reason why this is the most popular dish...it was amazing.Cravings is a must try for Asian food lovers. I highly recommend it.", 
      "Generous portions and cheap price. A college student's dream. I got the chicken with vegetables for a lunch one day. They give a wide array of vegetables and the sauce was good but the chicken was okay. They give you soup along your lunch so that was nice (though I didn't really like the soup). The dish was yummy but I'm sure the other choices are a lot better. Such big portions so this could also be split between two people or saved for later.Decent food but I do prefer Golden Harbor.", 
      "Cravings is one of the best cheap authentic Chinese restaurant on campus. Their location, price, and portions are unbeatable in all of CU. My favorite dishes are:-Pork belly with preserved veggie-Fish with Shanghainese bokchoy-Fish Marsala-Mapo Tofu-Jakarta fried rice-Chicken and veggie (or chicken lo mein)-Crispy chicken/beefThe one thing I don't like is the smell inside so I usually get take out and it's always crowded so it's good to call ahead and pay with cash when you get there for that discount. However, make sure you pay the meter because I went in to pick up take out and when I got out there was a ticket :(The only other comparable place is Golden Wok but it's a bit far on University so you'll need a car to get there (they have free parking)", 
      "Five minutes in I wanted to leave. So I did. It wasn't very busy, walked in and sat down, didn't realize you're supposed to order and fetch yourself. Table was dirty, started to wipe it down as I noticed the manager was standing there watching me and not offering to help.All the other reviews rave about the bang for the buck on tasty food and I'm willing to bet they're right. Maybe one day I'll come back and take it to go.", 
      "More Authentic, cheaper prices. I'd have to say this place is a better priced for portion Chinese place while still maintaining a high quality sense of food. I've been here multiple times and my friends extremely love this place (their favorite being the Jakarta fried rice). I've tried a plethora of their menu and enjoyed every single one. Don't think you will be disappointed if you come here, the only complaint is that, it is quite small during busy hours, it might be difficult finding a spot to eat in the restaurant with a group", 
      "Very cheap and authentic Chinese food. The owner is very nice and the portion is very large.", 
      "Living at the corner of Green and Wright, I should have seen my addiction to Cravings as inevitable. There is a huge menu with a lot of great items. My favorites are the General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Jakarta Fried Rice, and the Hot and Spicy chicken. The food is delicious. The prices are great. You always get more than enough meat and a side of rice. That said, the place is kind of sketchy. There are rumors that it was closed for a few days in Spring 2013 due to health violations. And I'll admit, I have seen a bug or two crawl around right on the menu. But with the delicious, greasy food that comes out of here, I'm willing to eat a couple bugs. Definitely worth it. Pro Tip: Call in your order for pick up and start walking there. By the time you get there, your order will be ready to go and all you have to do is pay. Boom.", 
      "Ate a lot from this place while I went to school at UIUC. This place was super busy at lunch/dinner times but still very efficient. There masala fish was very delicious. Although it was sometimes difficult to find spots to sit.", 
      "The Spicy Fish Masala is pure awesomeness. Shrimp Fried Rice is my next favorite. The flavor is unique. Will be a fan forever!", 
      "Man. I was wary about this place, because it looks like every other Chinese food place ever and I don't like most takeout restaurants. But it's really really good. Sure, it's not the swankiest of places, but if that bothers you so much take your food to go!First of all, the guy running the place is so cool. I told him I wasn't feeling well and wanted some soup. He was like, I have JUST the thing. Not long after, I picked up a huge bowl of soup with big ol' chunks of fish cakes, squid and shrimp. It was a hot and sour seafood soup with noodles, and it was nice and spicy. At most places, when they talk about spicy food, it's not really that hot. Not so at Cravings. I am used to eating spicy food and I was wiping my nose.Gross, I know.Anyway, the ingredients taste fresh and the portions are huge. They provide water and tea for free, which is great when it's cold outside. And they give great takeout containers for soups. I know, it's the little things. I'll definitely be back to try more on the extensive menu. Hm, I wonder if they deliver...", 
      "This is one of my favorite places to get Chinese food on campus! They are really fast and the food is delicious. The owners are extremely nice and accommodating and best of all, the food is very inexpensive. Every time family comes into town or I have friends over, we make our way to cravings for a great meal. You order at the counter and they call your number when you food is ready and all you do is go and pick it up yourself. No fuss dining. There is also free water, hot tea and plastic utensils in the front - server yourself.Here are some dishes I love:-spicy fried chili chicken: fried chicken pieces that are stir fried with scallions, spicy chili and sweet yellow onions (spicy and delicious! - all time fav!)-salt an pepper squid: fried strips of squid stir fried with green peppers and onions (crispy and irresistible)-masala fish: battered fish stir fried with masala spice and veggies-eggplant with ground pork: the eggplant is soft and tender, which is well balanced with the rice ground pork-pork belly-clams with black bean sauce-mapo tofuThe staff is super friendly and have great recommendations if you're not sure what to get. Overall, great food! This place gets packed pretty quickly so make sure you snag a table!", 
      "A little bit of home away from home. \u00a0A wide selection, healthy portions, cheap prices, and consistently yummy Chinese food is why I really like it here. \u00a0Cravings reminds me of my mom's cooking which is always a great treat when I'm feeling homesick or just get ridiculously sick of dorm food (which is often). \u00a0They have a very extensive menu with something for everyone, they have lunch specials for even cheaper chow, and the owner is very friendly (yay for discounts, especially if you go often). \u00a0I would recommend any of their noodle or rice dishes (I frequently go with Ma Po Tofu or anything with chicken ^^) and they cater all people from those on special diets, vegetarians, Americanized Chinese food (think orange chicken), to the more traditional dishes.You can take-out as with most Chinese restaurants, but I've always sat down with friends when I eat here. \u00a0Good eats.", 
      "I am hesitant to give out 5 stars on Yelp, but Cravings earns mine without a doubt.This is not only the best Chinese food in Champaign-Urbana, but also some of the best Chinese fast food I've had anywhere. I'm from Los Angeles, where we claim Monterrey Park and Alhambra as the official China Town of America, at least cuisine-wise, but I find that Cravings beats out most of the places I've eaten at out here.During the year I spent living in Urbana, I frequented Cravings almost every week, and during that time I have tasted almost half the items on the menu.Most students coming grab a lunch-sized dish for $5 or $6, but ordering the $8 or $9 full dishes pays off if you plan to be out studying all day. You get so much food that you can easily take half of it with you to go, so you can finish it later while studying at the library or wherever.Menu highlights include the Mongolian Beef, the Marsala Fish (careful, very spicy!), the spicy crunch chicken, or if you want healthy, the seaweed seafood dishes.If you're just a beginner, you might want to just stick with the Mongolian Beef, General Tso's chicken, or Kung Pao just to experience how they do the classics so well and full of flavor, then move on to other items in subsequent visits.My biggest regret in leaving Urbana is being able to taste the food that this wonderful Malaysian family has brought to corn-field country!", 
      "There are really better options, both in Champaign and on campus.I don't really want to say that, because I used to love Cravings. \u00a0Like many of the people writing 5 star reviews, I was impressed by the large menu, the frequently cheerful staff, and the mostly reasonable prices. \u00a0But as I went to other Chinese places in town, my opinion began to change. \u00a0I noticed that most of the dishes at Cravings were really heavy and oily. \u00a0And that most of the specials were very similar to one another. \u00a0And that some of the menu options .. didn't really match what was being described. \u00a0I don't mind some innovation, and I know you can't really get a Japanese style bowl of Ramen anywhere in Champaign, but Cravings' offering is nowhere close.The last three times I went I ended up throwing out my leftovers. \u00a0I absolutely hate wasting food, but I couldn't finish them. \u00a0One was a squid special; the squid was extremely chewy and seemed overcooked. \u00a0The plate was mostly green peppers in a salty sauce, in any case. \u00a0Another was a \"coconut shrimp\" plate. \u00a0This translated to fried shrimp with (very sweet) uncooked coconut milk simply poured over them. \u00a0Unhealthy and not even tasty. \u00a0The last was Gado Gado Fish, which I remembered getting and enjoying in the past. \u00a0It was still really heavy - lots of breading with an oily, thick sauce. \u00a0If you want to spend a little more money, I highly recommend Golden Harbor instead. \u00a0But the food is much better.If you want to spend about the same or just a little more, I'd check out Lai Lai Wok instead - which I think is overrated, too, but is a bit better than Cravings. \u00a0Or you could get take-out from Rainbow Garden, which is pretty solid. \u00a0If you want to spend less, you could try out Empire or Bo Bo China. \u00a0(Bo Bo China is all you can eat if you really want to maximize your calories/dollar.)", 
      "Oh how I miss CRAVINGS.This place is really like home away from home. The guy who runs the place is from my hometown in Malaysia. So usually when I walk in here I just ask him whats good today and I just take what he recommends.For fans of uber spicy dishes, try the chilli chicken.Yes the place is dingy, but its really cheap, especially if you split family style. You can call ahead to order.", 
      "I think the food here is not bad. It is kind of between the American Chinese food and the Authentic one. And it is cheap...", 
      "Yes. Yes. Yes.We went here on a whim after freezing our butts off at an Illini game and it hit the spot. It had every kind of Asian dish on the menu, and while I'm usually weary of places that have more than one kind of cuisine offered, this one delivered.I ordered the sweet and spicy udon soup with chicken and it was amaaazing! My boyfriend also really loved his beef curry. The portions were also huge and everything was really cheap. I don't know how I've been a townie and not known about this place. Gem!", 
      "Having spent 5 years at the University of Illinois, Cravings was far and away the hot spot for the college of engineering (across the street from the engineering campus) students for lunch or dinner. I must have been to this place over 50 times. The staff is extremely friendly. Every time I go there I ask G' Tao (owner) for a new dish based on my preferences, he never disappoints. Only knock on this place the food is a little oily and I wouldn't consider it healthy eating haha. But when the food is this good who cares!Long Story Short: There have been several times where I was bashing my head at the computer lab working on an engineering project and just said \"Screw this, I'm going to Cravings\". Nothing saved the day like food from Cravings. Shop Notes: Pretty small shop and gets packed pretty quickly around lunch and dinner. Service is very quick and efficient, take out is always a good option. Very reasonably priced with pretty large portions.Sentence Summary: Is the food entirely healthy? Not really. Is it delicious and authentic? Absolutely.", 
      "This is the tastiest Chinese food on campus (note, Golden Harbor is not on campus). It is also the cheapest, and they give large portions -- for me, easily enough for 2 meals usually. Most dishes are $6-8. Some more special ones are $9-12. The more American orange/General Tso's/sweet and sour/etc. chicken dishes are $5.25. The owner guy behind the counter most of the time is one of the friendliest restaurant workers I have ever met. Tips:-They make Chinese food the best. If you're unsure of what to get, your best bet is to get something Chinese instead of Japanese/Thai/etc. -Be sure to look at the white board on the floor to the left of the counter! -Explore the Chinese menu sitting on the counter (it has English translations) These are some of my favorites: Basil pork egg rice, Jakarta fried rice, Pork with preserved vegetables, Crispy beef, Fried fish fillets with bok choy, Beef stew eggplant pot, Spicy fried chicken, Mapo tofu, Sizzling chicken pot.", 
      "I love this place. Great food and the owner is super friendly. I am a senior on campus and I would argue that this is the best Chinese restaurant on campus.What should you eat? Jakarta fried rice, Spicy Chicken, and Crispy Beef. I literally came here 2 or 3 times a week this past summer and I never regretted it.", 
      "Love this place for cheap and pretty tasty chinese-ish food. \u00a0Went there the other day, and my boyfriend and i split the fish masala (crispy and spicy) and pork hofun (noodly with mild brown sauce). \u00a02 very different meals, both delicious and very filling. \u00a0Food is very reasonably priced,. \u00a0Restaurant does look a bit dingy and generally smells a bit funky, maybe a greasy-smell. \u00a0Still recommend the food.", 
      "Overrated, clap, clap, clap, clap. \u00a0Overrated.Yelpers, I usually trust your judgment, but you didn't get this one right.Since I love small hole-in-the-wall places with friendly owners (this place meets those criteria), this review is kind of hard to write, but I have to do it.The Mongolian beef that I ordered was cold. \u00a0 \u00a0Additionally, it wasn't sweet, and there were a lot of onions in the dish. \u00a0A lot!The ingredients (rice, beef and onions) were fine, but I can't eat something that has been sitting around for awhile and isn't fresh and hot.I'll try this place again because the owner is a nice guy, but my first experience wasn't a good one.", 
      "I'll keep this short and sweet. I really really enjoy the food. That being said, you are eating it with the risk of getting food poisoning. If Cravings does not pass their next inspection, they will be shut down because they time and time again have violated many food safety laws.", 
      "One of my favorite lunch spots. For the price, it's hard to beat what you get here. Definitely recommend the hot and spicy chicken, or the chicken lo mein. It can be greasy but it's worth it.Update: Recently, I tried a tofu dish and this is not their strength. I'd recommend not getting tofu from this place, although I still love the chicken lo mein and hot and spicy chicken.", 
      "Cravings definitely has the best Chinese food I've had in the area, and probably ever. \u00a0I highly recommend the Sweet and Sour Chicken (an American favorite); it's perfectly crispy and delicious. \u00a0Also great are the noodle soups, and the red curry. \u00a0The guy who runs the place is awesome, and even though it's usually packed, I've never not found a place to sit down. \u00a0I wish I could give Cravings 5 stars, but I can't. \u00a0Their menu is too big, and, as a result, you can find some serious misses if you order incorrectly. \u00a0I've had some of the best Asian food at Cravings, but also some of the worst. \u00a0They should record everything everyone orders for a couple months, and only keep the top 20% of all items sold (which would result in a menu that's still too big).If you haven't been, go with someone, someone who you trust, who can help you to order correctly, and you won't be disappointed.", 
      "Cravings is mediocre random Asian food at its finest. They serve Chinese, Thia, Indian, and maybe some other stuff, too. You will leave full for under ten bucks, and it won't make ya sick later, AND there's free tea! w/ your order, cheapo. +1 star for being right across the street from Everitt.", 
      "I ordered takeout with a friend, after he said this place was really good. \u00a0I got a vegetable - udon noodle dish, since my spot in line came up before I was ready and I had to make a snap decision. \u00a0I also got fried rice and crab rangoon. \u00a0I wish I had more time to decide, but we were in a hurry. \u00a0The menu was much larger than I was expecting, divided into different regions, and I would love to come back and try something else.Total, including tax, came to around $13, which is pretty good for the amount of food I got. \u00a0Even though I was warned to be ready for a wait, and it was the dinner rush, we got out in probably about 15 minutes. \u00a0My udon ended up being good, if a bit plain. \u00a0The crab rangoon was good, and I wish I had more of it, but it was not spectacular. \u00a0I was told the fried rice was very good, though a bit on the salty side. \u00a0Looking at the other reviews, I suspect I will have to give this place another try and order something different. \u00a0Maybe it will blow me away next time.", 
      "I have been going to Cravings for 5 years now and every time I go, I can't wait to go again. \u00a0I always go with a group for friends and order family style. \u00a0All the dishes are large enough to accommodate it. \u00a0The Spicy Chilli Chicken is awesome as well as the Salt and Pepper Squid (a version of calamari). \u00a0I have yet to try a dish I did not enjoy...expect for when I accidentally ordered cows stomach. \u00a0The owner was nice enough to take it back and give me another dish free of charge.", 
      "OK.First I need to say that I'm not a Chinese food fan. But, I like some kinds of it.Ambient of this restaurant is very bad. There is always a smell and smoke inside. Because of that you may start coughing. This is a very bad thing!Food is OK. But I had better experiences about Chinese restaurants, so this is not my first option in C-U.And, price is reasonable, actually cheap. However, service is so slow. So many people order by phone before they're coming to this restaurant. To sum up, if you wanna have a Chinese food, Cravings wouldn't be your first option, as long as you're not specifically try the food of \"South China\". I recommend Evo, in C-U area.", 
      "I've been coming to Cravings every couple weeks for the last two years or so.It is the best Asian restaurant in Champaign County, bar none. Golden Harbor is a close second.The two workers who deal with customers are the friendliest restaurant workers I think I have ever encountered. After fifty visits here, I have never seen either one in an apparent bad mood. They're just happy people, and happy people make great food.FYI: Whilst observing the magic behind the curtain one day, I did see them cooking the vegetables by blanching them in a deep fat fryer along with the egg rolls. -- And that's why Chinese food tastes good, folks!", 
      "Ah, Cravings. \u00a0My old stand-by Chinese place. \u00a0Good food at a good price. \u00a0They have both the typical Chinese fare that most Americans are used to and a pretty full true Chinese menu. \u00a0Orange chicken is really good, so is the Mongolian beef. \u00a0The only thing I've been disappointed in there is the veggie egg rolls.", 
      "Yes, yes, yes! These people aren't goofing around! Although this restaurant is lacking in atmosphere, this is fully made up for in quality and quantity of food. It is by far the best tasting Chinese I have had on campus, for a bargain deal too! Bang for your buck, get some takeout and give it \u00a0a try.", 
      "I've eaten here all throughout undergrad, and stopped by again this past weekend while visiting campus. My absolute favorite dish, Indonesian Fried Rice, did not disappoint (think huge pieces of shrimp and chicken in a bed of delicious seasoned rice with a spicy kick, and the perfect runny egg to top it off). They have really good authentic Chinese dishes as well (Mapo Tofu, Crispy Tofu, Pork and Bittermelon, Three Cup Chicken). The owner is incredibly nice and, overall, the service is very friendly. If you are looking for a no-fuss place and delish authentic Chinese food or their more American counterparts (Cashew Chicken, Orange Chicken, etc.) for reasonable prices, you've come to the right place.Cravings, I love you.",

      "Cheap Asian food (though on the oily side). Cravings definitely gets busy during the lunch hours though. The owner is a cool guy, he knows a ton of Asian languages and dialects.Oh yeah, don't eat in the restaurant unless you want to go back to class/lab smelling like Chinese food.", 
      "Pretty good", 
      "Fair price for the food. The owner is fun to chat with, and they have good service. A great place to eat on campus town.Like their Uno w/spicy noodle soup! It's like tom yum!", 
      "Outstanding....i usually get the american \"chinese\" like general tsos, sesame chicken, etc. \u00a0The jakarta fried rice with tofu and veggies is also amazing. \u00a0Really cheap (about 6 bucks) for a d-lish hot meal. \u00a0I usually try not to eat the whole plate because it is definitely more than one healthy person should eat, but i usually can't stop myself. \u00a0couple of types of tea for free while you eat in...gets packed during peak times around noon and dinner time, so seating can get hard to find, but getting it to go and eating at home or outside somewhere works just as well.cravings is the go to place for us ae students in the area...someone always has it in the lab, and always makes me want some...actually, in all honesty, after writing all of this, i am walking straight there.", 
      "Very decently priced food, with a with a wide variety of items on the menu. Menu size does not matter however as this place is all about the Jakarta fried rice. Once you've had Jakarta fried rice here, you kind of tend to never order anything else.", 
      "I've been going to Cravings for lunch about 2-3 times a month for the last 1.5 years, and have had a whole bunch of items on their menu. Most items on their American menu and Chinese menu are just fine (wouldn't get more than a 3-star ranking), but their ma la fish and Singapore chow fun are absolutely amazing!!! And the best part is that you get a lot of food for ~$8!", 
      "I LOVE this place and if I had a million hours to waste I would walk my lazy self across campus and pick up some sweet and sour chicken and have a free Styrofoam cup of green tea every day of my life. Unfortunately they do not deliver and I don't even think they know how to use a phone. The last time I was there the man was so busy he picked up the phone and put them on hold and never picked it back up. I found it funny, but I'm sure that customer did not. And, you know, if they opt out of delivery they should really clean the place up a bit. I get worried what the kitchen looks like and have peeked back there a few times to see complete chaos (mostly because there's 8 or 9 women cooking for too many customers to handle). I love the food, but this place is great to go to maybe a few times per semester. It's just too crowded for my liking.", 
      "Large portions, friendly staff, cheap prices, and delicious food.The atmosphere is strictly dive - but the food is good enough that no one cares (nor should they.", 
      "Cravings really caters to poor college students--the prices are cheap and the portions are decently sized. And it also helps that the food is actually good here.", 
      "Holy Mapo Tofu! \u00a0I ordered this the first time going and I was blown away. \u00a0There was no fuss in \"holding the meat\", so I think this place is pretty veg-friendly. \u00a0It was packed when I went to pick up my food, but it was ready in the short walk it took me to get there (less than 15 min).I will sample much more from the menu but based on their Mapo tofu alone I will easily award 5 stars.", 
      "i dont get the hype. It's cheap chinese food.", 
      "One sentence to sum up this place: The Jack of all trades, master of none. This restaurant has 2 things going for it. Location close to campus and a large student population that values abundance over quality. Ninja doesn't need a lot of so so food. He likes tasty food. Sometimes too much so so food weigh binds down before sword fight.", 
      "Ok, Cravings is an interesting experience. There is no atmosphere. The food is sketchy. The line is usually long, it's crowded, and the huge menu is scattered in about 5 different places, making it a little weird the first time you go. But you will be back. I don't know what they put in their food here, but everything is just really, really tasty. It's not going to win any culinary awards any time soon, but for the cheap price, you get a lot of downright delicious chinese food. I've probably been here at least a hundred times over my years on campus, so I'll try to keep this review condensed. Go to Cravings. Order the hot and spicy diced chicken. And never look back.", 
      "The name says it all. I had to go here at least once a week to satisfy my craving. spicy chicken/beef Ho Fun my my favorite dish. There was a beef noodle stew which I also enjoyed. It gets packed there around lunch and dinner time so sometimes get take out.", 
      "Best bang for your buck. I live on Hot n Spicy Chicken. Nuff said.", 
      "2 things to order- Jakarta fried rice and hot and spicy chicken.", 
      "I really enjoy this place it has good food, nice owners who want you to change your order up every so often and good prices. I had jakarta fried rice and meat with cilantro both were good. Although I would recommend not getting the sesame chicken its a bit too sweet but other than that I think they have the best chinese food here.", 
      "I will admit that I am not the most adventurous eater. I am especially wary of Chinese restaurants. Good Chinese food is awesome; bad Chinese food is one of the nastiest things on earth. So I rarely go to a new Chinese place without someone telling me that it's worth trying.A couple of my husband's co-workers (who were very in-the-know about Chinese food) told him that Cravings was one of the best in town. We tried it, and it became one of our mainstays. We usually order the crispy beef, which is lightly breaded and fried (I think) and then tossed in this incredible sweet-spicy sauce. One order is enough for both of us, and unlike other places that do not use the best part of the cow when they are breading and frying it and tossing it in a delicious sauce, the beef is usually really good--not tough and stringy and fatty and gross.The man who owns Cravings is very nice, and I'm always happy to see crowds eating there. They seem to have authentic dishes along with the Americanized stuff, so if you want a steamed whole fish, you can get one here. I would try other things, but I am too addicted to the crispy beef to move on.", 
      "Only complaint is my clothes usually smell after I come out of the restaurant. Otherwise great place for the price.", 
      "You get a but load of food for around 5 dollars. Try their Jakarta fried rice if you want a new spin on fried rice!", 
      "Not even a question about it, this is the best chinese food you can get in urbana, possibly in the entire midwest. I went to school in Champaign for a year, and I ate at Cravings at least once a week, it was my comfort food, my go to for when friends visited, and the thing I miss most. If you are in champaign and like food, this hole in the wall is a must. I recommend the Mongolian Beef!", 
      "I've been living off Cravings these past 2 years, literally.They have a big menu so the tip is you know what to order. Don't just try something randomly as you might have a negative experience.The owner is very nice and every time I ran into him in Champaign, he always remembered me and said hi to me.Dishes that I recommend include -hot & spicy chicken (my go-to dish. I had this like everyday last spring); -mapo tofu (really good, spicy, and only 6.50 for a very generous portion); -gado gado chicken (nutty and sweet);-masala fish (crispy and spicy fish fillet); -beef pan fried chow fun (stir-fried beef with large noodle, really good);-Sizzling chicken pot (I have to stress it. it's SIZZLING chicken cooked with basil and onion);-Pepper and Salt Squid (apparently everything starts with \"Pepper and Salt ___\" is really good. Try pepper and salt fish also).Some more Chinese dishes that I like:-black mush room & tofu w/ groundpork;-basil pork with rice;-bean noodles with ground pork (a lot of people asked me what I had when I ordered this dish);-hot & sour seafood noodle soup (tom yum based, with LOTS of seafood, perfectly for a cold day);(these 4 dishes above can be found on the white board near the counter).The Mongolian beef is good but it's not consistent. I like it to be a bit overcooked, but sometimes it's still a little rare to my liking, especially during peak hours.These dishes are all from the Chinese menu since i'm not a big fan of Americanized dishes in general.", 
      "I love this place.Not only does it have fond memories in my heart of high school and college, it has great food and great staff.The man that owns it is super nice. When I used to go with my sister a lot in high school, he always gave us a huge smile and said, 'Hi twins!'The Indonesian fried rice, Crispy beef, Crunchy Chicken, and basically anything on the menu is amazing.I love this place.", 
      "This place has the best orange chicken I have ever tasted. My only regret is that I discovered it so late in my undergrad. The food is made in a respectable amount of time and the owner is so friendly. Call ahead because this place is always packed around dinner time. The free hot tea is fantastic. I like everything about this place and can't wait for the next time I am able to go. Five stars are well deserved.", 
      "I had the so called famous Jakarta Rice, but it was not very satisfying. \u00a0However, for the price, the food is decent and the serving size is pretty big.", 
      "Cravings is one of the things I miss most about Champaign...Some menu items are more authentic than others. \u00a0Service is very friendly-- the owner is great!", 
      "I know everyone loves cravings...maybe I havent ordered the right things. I have ordered maybe 1/2 dozen times from there over the past few years and have found most of their food to be too heavy. My favorite dish from there that Ive ordered is the Jakarta fried rice, which is heavy but has good flavour. On the other hand the price is right and its convenient.", 
      "Good food. \u00a0The Thai Basil Green Beans are a favorite of mine. \u00a0The ordering system is a bit convoluted, and be sure to come when it isn't busy.", 
      "On a college students budget, this place is a mecca for getting a full stomach. \u00a0For about six bucks, I can get orange chicken with rice, at excellent quality, not to mention that the portions are huge which is a fantastic quality. \u00a0Only downside is a long wait during peak hours.", 
      "I wish I could import this restaurant to Hyde Park so I can have Cravings whenever I don't feel like cooking. Its the cheap but great Chinese eatery brought to life with low, low prices, order at counter, big, heaping portions, free tea in styrofoam cups, etc. Staff is really friendly and the dishes we tried were pretty good too. Try the chili chicken and the eggplant.", 
      "Great food at reasonable priceIts kinda nasty but who caresZakarta fried rice recommended if you don't know what to get", 
      "I love this place! \u00a0My girlfriend and I always get the spicy chili chicken and green beans with tofu gan. \u00a0Everything that we get here is amazing! \u00a0Great service! \u00a0However, your clothes tend to smell bad after eating here. \u00a0I wince at the people who come in dressed in suits....", 
      "They have a huge selection of dishes. The fried rice, noodles and chicken in garlic sauce are all deelish! \u00a0I love the tea too. This place is great.", 
      "I go at least 1 every 2 weeks. I LOVE THIS PLACE. \u00a0 I am addicted to there Jakarta Fried Rice. I always look for it when I go to other places but they don't have it. If they do have it they don't come close to Cravings' version. Their menu is really big. Everything that I have tried I liked. I like that people speak Chinese it gives it an authentic feel.", 
      "my friends hate me for loving cravings but it is just so cheap for so much food. I've heard the tofu is horribly bad, so don't get that. Really hit or miss menu so be aware (not surprising given that there are about 60 things on the menu). I like the orange chicken (because I am not used to authentic chinese food, so I don't know any better) and the chicken lo mein (order it spicy).", 
      "This place deserves 5 stars.. \u00a0every time I pass by this place, I want to eat here. .. Only problem is their same dishes taste differently each time... so one need to make sure what he wants.. \u00a0The owner speaks many languages, hence is pretty funny...", 
      "Ultimate Asian food experience. LOL", 
      "Simple but good chinese food. Recommend sezchuan or hunan chicken dishes. However, very busy at peak meal times so plan wisely.", 
      "Cravings is one of those restaurants that you would just find reasons to go back to. This place is really for what it offers inexpensive. There is no real service, and I don't seem to mind that one little bit. You order at the counter, and for your order you are given a card with a number on it. And a few minutes later, your food/number is called out which you can take back from the counter to your table. Oh yeah, you are expected to bus your own plates once you are done eating. Now the food: they have a wide range of Chinese and adapted Chinese cuisines from Malaysia, India and Indonesia. Their menu is super long but surprisingly this doesn't seem to effect the consistency of the food made. Unfortunately, my food recommendations might not work for you as I am vegetarian. But anyway, Green bean or vegetables stir fry in Hunan sauce seem to my usual picks. Jakarta fried rice with tofu is also something that I really like. They have some soup and Chinese tea for free, which you can ask the owner about. The owner is real friendly and always indulges in the occasional chat if he happens to be unoccupied. I did take a star out though, because sometimes the tables are left dirty. Because of the absence or regular cleaning staff, the tables are left dirty sometimes by inconsiderate customers. Be warned, the tables are packed if you go during the rush hours. All in all, you have to love cravings!"

      "Date of Original Review: 09/11/2014*Based off of visits from August 2012 - May 2014Murphy's Pub is an awesome place to be any day or night of the week. The food and drink selections are great and fairly priced. The pub has several billiards tables, a jukebox, and a small outdoor smoking area with several tables and chairs. One of the greatest things about Murphy's Pub, other than the lively, fun and friendly bartenders, is that it offers several fun weekly events such as free bingo and trivia for prizes.", 
      "I love watching drunk freshman share the plate of Irish Nachos, absolutely hilarious. Burgers are great, beers good enough for a campus bar. Exactly what you expect.", 
      "What a shit hole! Came here for a drink and a burger and I never made it that far. It was almost 4 in the afternoon and I sat at a pub table. My sleeve got stuck to the table. A voice came from behind the bar that said. If you want drinks or food, you have to order at the bar as there were no waitresses. I got up and grabbed a couple menu's. Looked it over and said. Let's go, I've seen enough. I will only pass thru college towns from now on!", 
      "Dropped in on a Saturday afternoon and the place was empty. We sat at a table by the bar and the bartender said we have no servers so you have to order here. We looked at the menu and standard bar food nothing different than others. Being Saturday and plenty of college games on but just not happening here. Most likely a lively place later and could be decent to hang. Just did not work this time.", 
      "4 stars for tradition, 2 stars for food quality and 1 for service. The female bartender that took our lunch order had ZERO personality. They make you pay up front for your food. Every time I said \"Thank-you\" to the bartender, she replied with \"No Problem\". I'm glad it wasn't a problem. I'd recommend drinking here at night, but not eating.", 
      "Ate here last night with 11 friends - maybe the worst meal we've ever had. Food was cold. Almost broke a tooth on a French Fry. No table service. Place was dirty. Do you get the idea it was bad?Skip it and save yourself a possible trip to the dentist.", 
      "Nice bar to grab food and a beer at. Service from bartenders is mediocre. Atmosphere is Irish-feeling but feels kinda meh", 
      "This is the best bar on campus. If you're looking to have a conversation with friends and/or potential dates, Murphy's is for you. The bartenders are friendly, the food is always made to order, and the pub is the \u00a0cleanest on campus.", 
      "I always look for a nice pub when visiting different cities. I saw this while walking on campus and decided to check it out.... Staff not friendly or sociable... Maybe it's because Im from the south and use to hospitality ....but damn how about a smile and a conversation I WAS ONLY PERSON at the bar.. I even tried to get a convo going... I know my opinion isn't going to close the bar but as a former bartender who OWNs a company now .... Customer Service is what will make you $$$.", 
      "nice selection of beer and they have Green Line on tap! the bartender who was there when we went was great at recommendations for all different tastes. cheap prices and a cool divey feel.", 
      "As my favorite place to drink in Champaign, Murphys has to get 5 stars. The food at Murphys is solid. Not fantastic but solid and you gotta get the Irish Nachos to split with a few friends. The food can take a while to come out, especially if they're busy, so just be patient. The best nights at Murphy's are Wednesdays and Thursdays.Wednesday is logo night so you can grab a pint and keep the glass for under $5 and refills are only $2.50 I think. Phenomenal deal. My cabinets are full of awesome logo glasses thanks to Murphy's. Thursdays are phenomenal because it's $2 pints. Any pint for just $2. You'll never beat that. I hear they may have upped it to $2.50 but that's a good variety of decent quality pints for just $2.50. Go out with a $10 bill and you'll have an awesome night. That simple, that's all you need.", 
      "Good times with friends and cheap beers, and that's pretty much it.The food is not bad, but its just bar food, so u cant expect much. The Irish Nachos is good to order with two more people. The other appetizers are just ok (hmm, the spicy cheese bites are good, although small), but there's usually some food special everyday.Because of the regular coming, you develop certain bonds with the place, even if the place is not great. If this bar was located anywhere outside Campus, I dont think I would ever go there. However, the memories make the place and thats pretty much how Murphys survives.", 
      "One of my favorite places to have a beer in Champaign. \u00a0Usually good drink specials and a good juke box. \u00a0Irish Nachos are a must if you're hungry!", 
      "So that no one may be further misled, Murphy's can only be truly appreciated though the lens of a college student. The place caters to the average college-aged individual who is content to fraternize with his or her colleagues over inexpensive alcoholic beverages and greasy diner food. While classier than the average campus-town bar, Murphy's by no means rivals the sophistication of the surrounding bars of downtown Champaign and Urbana. Classically, Murphy's tends to be more popular among the graduate and older undergraduate students, but that doesn't deter alumni and non-student patrons from frequenting. The beer selection outmatches any other bar on the University of Illinois campus and it is a bargain cost-wise compared to the non-campus bars. Food is typically served until 11 p.m. each night, with one of the most popular dishes being the \"Irish Nachos\" - essentially a whole plate of waffle fries decked with nacho toppings that you'll need a friend or two to finish. A host of burgers and other fried foods are also available with various specials throughout the week. \u00a0I have nothing but the fondest memories of Murphy's Pub. There's nothing ritzy about it, but if you're open to having (or reliving!) a fun yet relaxing college night, Murphy's is the place for you!", 
      "It's a pub when you're looking for a pub, not a bar. And that's a good thing. Murphy's keeps things simple, cheap and fun. This is always a good place to have a beer after a long day working, and just enjoy the casual feel.", 
      "If you were to add up the amount of time I spent at Murphy's in college, it would probably be close to the total time I spent in class. \u00a0Even today, this haunt is still our campus favorite when down in CU for a football/basketball/hockey game. \u00a0Back in my day, they didn't have the new addition but having the additional space makes it much easier to get a table and some space to move around without affecting the divey-campus bar feel. \u00a0Wednesday is Logo Glass Night, and I have several boxes of the great glasses I accumulated over the years.Their beers on tap is great, especially for a campus bar. \u00a0The food is pretty good pub grub, but I believe there is a \"game-day menu\" where only certain things are served, which is kind of a bummer if you want Irish nachos on game-day because it's not on the menu. \u00a0The jukebox is great (every fricking song by The Black Keys can be found on there) and there are loads of flat screens to catch whatever game is on. \u00a0If you get there early, you won't even have to pay a cover.", 
      "Murphy's burger and fries. A classic. You can go for all your fancy burgers, custom cooking, whatever it is. But, I will always reminisce about the burgers at Murphy's. It's no longer the tiny dive bar it was when I was in college, but it still has a very relaxed feel. Feel free to carve into the old wooden tables, everyone over the past 15 years has!", 
      "A bar I spend a lot of time at. \u00a0There is a great selection of beers, with 25 on draft plus a selection of bottles. \u00a0There are the normal ones, but then more interesting drafts such as Bells, Warsteiner, Spaten, Summit, etc. \u00a0The burgers are great, but the fries vary in quality-- when they're good, they're really good... but othertimes not so much. \u00a0There is soup and chili in the winter, and the Irish Nachos are a U of I staple. \u00a0Usually is busy Wednesday thru Saturday, with Thursday being the best specials ($2 Import drafts and bottles, $2 Bacardi Singles, $4 Jim/Svedka Doubles, $6.75 Killians & Honey Brown pitchers). \u00a0If you want a table on those nights, you need to get their early. Sometimes the jukebox leads to very questionable music.", 
      "Murphy's is the dive bar that we all kind of grew up on. Sitting right in the middle of campustown, it's a hard place to miss, whether it's the big-on-wood exterior, the fantastically long lines to get in every Thurs/Fri/Sat night, or the plentiful logo mugs the average Illini will obtain, it's just the place to be.Few places outside of college campuses will you find $1 pints, or $3 you-call-its, $4 pitchers. Much lower key than Legends, Murphy's has the unique feel of being open to anyone willing to take a step out of their dorm roomsYou can't call your bar-hop night a barcrawl if you don't stop here. The food is good, the drinks cheap, and the people are always merry in Murphy's. I will miss every night I've remembered, or forgotten here.", 
      "The minimal bare acceptable campus bar for graduate student inhabitation. \u00a0But only on weeknights. \u00a0When there are no sporting events. \u00a0And your car has run out of gas and can't get you out of campustown. \u00a0And you really need a drink because your advisor just called you to tell you you have to cancel your weekend plans to come over and shovel his sidewalk. \u00a0The leftover vomit is less tangible, the smoky haze less all-engulfing, and the number of 14 year olds skanks less overwhelming than anywhere else on campus (except firehaus, but apparently no one goes to firehaus despite the fact that it is clean, devoid of skanks, and conveniently located.)", 
      "This is my favorite bar on campus.It is a solid pub where they serve cheap and delicious beer. \u00a0The food is decent, but not that great. \u00a0That said, the specials on Tuesday and Wednesday offer a pretty good value ($5 for 1/2 lb burger + fries).What could really improve this place is better music. \u00a0The jukebox is too susceptible to people with bad music tastes. \u00a0Also, the tables can be kind of sticky, but thats par with the course.", 
      "Out of the bars on campus, I'd have to say Murphy's is higher up on the list as they're a good place to stop by day or night. \u00a0During the day, you can come here and they have these kickass big, savory, juicy burgers (a different burger and fries special each day) that are really yummy and filling so if you haven't already, try making it out here at least once for lunch. \u00a0You go in and order at the bar, and then walk to the back where they prepare your order to pick it up.There's usually no cover here at night (with the exception of special occasions such as Unofficial, Mom's/Dad's weekend, etc.) and have good, knowledgeable bartenders. \u00a0There's a wide selection of beers - over 25 I believe? - and they make a kickass Amaretto Sour (my fav next to Irish Car Bombs, btw, so you should buy me one if you see me out at the bars ever ^__~, they're like a Starburst in a glass!). \u00a0Like all the other bars, this place gets quite crowded on weekends and as everyone else here has commented on, the jukebox is loud and, at $1 a song, gets heavy use/abuse. \u00a0Some of the stuff that comes out of that thing... I don't know, man... =PThe specials here are also pretty sweet - yay for logo glass night. \u00a0Overall, it's just a great campus bar to frequent anytime.", 
      "Ok seriously, this place serves some of the best tasting Guiness on tap that I've had thus far! (And this coming from a beer lover who hits irish bars in Chicago). It's really fresh! My college buddies and I returned to this old college hotspot to reminisce on old times. We used to come for Mug Night on Wednesdays so this place brings back great memories.It's been 8 years since I've been here, so I was really surprised when the food and beer was actually better than I remembered! \u00a0First of all, I already mentioned their beer on tap. it's quality and fresh! and low cost. Secondly, their burgers still rock in an awesome way! I had their Turkey burger while my friends had the regular cheeseburgers. Man oh man these burgers are juicy and seculent. The turkey burger is well flavored and succulent. \u00a0We basically scarfed down our meals including the yummy fries. Another good thing is that they also expanded this place - it used to be way too crowded but they added a whole other section to this place. They have a nice layout with table sizes that comfortably accomodate anywhere from 4 to parties in the teens. I love their spacious bench seat tables. If you're visiting U of I, definitely hit up this place! It's a cherished favorite.", 
      "This is my favorite of all the campus bars hands down. Every Thursday night during the school year, a club I'm in takes over the basement (pool tables, darts and all) to hang out in. I can't even count all the great memories I've made there. Unfortunately, on Friday and Saturday nights the lines build up pretty fast, so it's best to get in before it gets packed.In terms of food/drink, great fries, great specials on drinks. ($2 Woodchuck Thursdays!)", 
      "A couple of friends and I decided to take a spur of the moment trip to Urbana to meet our parent campus and get to know the university. It was a sunday and we wanted to catch the NFL games so, naturally, we went up to a bar. Murphy's was our 3rd choice (after the other 2 bars were either closed or not showing any games). The place was empty (not surprising coming from a college town where all they care about is Saturday Football) except for a couple of old guys talking to themselves.They had a lot of TVs and only one game on, when we asked them to switch it they couldn't because they didn't own the football package -strike one-Despite the place being deserted our server never took our order and we had to go up to the bar to have them take it. There is some controversy about this, as some bars will have you do that in the early evening but I've been to bars in the middle of nowhere at the same time where this wasn't the case. Either way, that was a bit annoying, so strike two.Strike three came along when after ordering we had to pick up our own food at the kitchen. At that point we gave up on good expectations and simply sat down to watch the game.The good news is their food is amazing. My friend and I are no fans of fries either but man they were awesome! And their bean burger was gigantic and extremely good according to my friend, while I had the steak sandwich and that was absolutely perfect.In any case, chances are the place is legit on Saturday Game Day, but it's up to you if you want to try it out.", 
      "Don't get me wrong, I love going to Murphy's and the Irish Nachos are awesome.The only reason this review is 3 stars is the varying service I've received. Sometimes it's great and there aren't any problems. But if it's crowded things quickly go downhill from there. For example, the last time I was there, I ordered Irish Nachos without bacon (because I'm vegetarian). The order (which is just fries with cheese and nacho toppings) took an hour. Once I got my order, it had bacon on it but I didn't send it back because I was so sick of waiting. Regardless to say, it definitely ruined the night to spend an hour hungry and waiting on food and then having to pick all of the bacon off.", 
      "This is the best bar on Green Street. I know that's not saying much, but let me explain. The drinks are cheap and really strong. The music is ok, there's an internet jukebox in the corner - so it's generally a crapshoot. The staff is very accommodating and courteous. The patrons tend to be less pretentious than other green street bars and are just there to have a good time drinking. There is no dress code, but anything more than a polo shirt would be over-dressed for guys.", 
      "I LOVE Murphy's! It has a great campus bar feel. Its a perfect location for campus for in between classes. A beer for everyone here because their draft list is extensive. My bartender was helpful and super nice! Would definitely recommend anyone to come here for lunch, a game day, or any night of the week!", 
      "Murphy's Pub really is a great college bar. \u00a0It tends to have a rather diverse mix of people, isn't usually overly loud and a great value. \u00a0The drink specials are quite good and the choices on tap are plentiful.Food is good for bar food, definitely get the Irish nachos sometime. \u00a0There really isn't anything Irish about them, but they are delicious.", 
      "Murphy's has always been my favorite bar on-campus and somewhere I have gone consistently as my first bar choice. It's a very chill bar but at the same time can be crazy fun with some great music and good company. The jukebox there is always a fun way to get the night going and they always have a huge selection of songs to choose from. Also, it's the place to be these days on Thursday nights, as the lines can get insanely long and have up to 30-40 min wait times depending on the night. So my advice to you would be to arrive around 9pm-9:30pm to avoid any lines, cause as soon as 10 o'clock rolls around, you'll be waiting a little bit to get in.The specials are always nice, with the $7 killians on Thursday and $2 Pints for Bluemoon, how could you go wrong? Also, with the new area that opened up, the wait for drinks has gone down to much shorter. Love the new space and the addition of the air-hockey table in the basement as well. In addition, the food is delicious! Best burgers and fries on campustown. The double-cheeseburger deal on Wednesdays (i think, might have to check on this) is amaziiinnnng. \u00a0Overall, this bar is chill and fun at the same time. It's not as chill as Legends (granted Legends may have more seating) but I don't think you'll get the same experience when comparing the bars.", 
      "Really Murphy's??? Why do you have such stars?What I was served was a ridiculously gross, flavorless hockey puck. I ordered (this word would be in italics if we had that font option on yelp) a grilled cajun style pork tenderloin sandwich....though this was definitely not what I received...I will never come back to this place of my own free will. Not only was the food abhorrent, the place was so dingy, dark, and grimy...not what I was looking for.So, thanks, but no thanks Murphy's.Folks, I highly advise you to pass this place up.", 
      "This is usually where I'm at if I go out to the bars, it seems to have the least amount of crappy people (you know what I'm talking about if you've been to any big state \"party school\") and not too expensive drinks. Can get very very crowded and absolutely NOTHING Irish about it. Irish nachos seemed to be waffle fries with nachos topping on them, what the fuck like?However, they were delicious. Their burgers made me real sick once but I got over it. If I'm going to a campus bar, Murphy's is my first choice. Plus they have lots of seating for us lazies.", 
      "Murphy's has the best atmosphere, patrons, employees, food, beer selection, space, price, drink specials, and Mortal Kombat II on campus. \u00a0If we haven't already met, then I'm sure we will at Murphy's.Definitely as good as it gets on campus.", 
      "My favorite C-U bar.Nice place - on campus, but without a heavy Illini feel. \u00a0I first started going because I was underage and they didn't card way back when, but kept going after I was legal because it's a good spot to eat and talk. \u00a0They cook excellent burgers and fries, and the teriyaki chicken sandwich is divine. \u00a0Many beers on tap and knowledgable bartenders.", 
      "Ohhhh the murphyburger, how I loved thee. \u00a0Best damn burger in town. \u00a0The mushroom cheeseburger was my favorite, and the fries - oh. so. good. \u00a0Extra pickles, please.I went back to campus a few years ago and found they had expanded - it's a little disconcerting, but at least the food is still the same. \u00a0Go Murphy's!", 
      "It's a good place if you're just looking for an Irish pub. \u00a0It has pretty good drink specials (with the exception of the weekend).. and it's bigger than most other bars on campus. \u00a0For the most part, I think it's clean except late on Friday or Saturday night.I do like some of their food too. \u00a0Their MegaBurger and Irish Nachos are really delicious. \u00a0And Wednesday and Friday have specials for the megaburger. \u00a0 \u00a0The people aren't pretty/hot.. I think it's frequented more by the drinker type instead of the going out type.", 
      "Best campus bar. Food can actually be quite good, especially the Kobe burger. The crispy, but greasy, fries have slowly grown on me. The beer selection is way better than any other bar on campus. They now have some Rogue ales, which are fantastic. Bar is homely, but at least it doesn't have a disease festering feel like certain other campus bars. Becomes increasingly less acceptable during weekends to the point where it actually is unsanitary and you can't hear anyone talking over the noise. The Jukebox churns out more and more horrifying music as people become intoxicated.  If you go here stick with weekdays. On weekdays it's actually a pretty nice place to hang out with friends.", 
      "Ah, Murphys. The one place where townies, undergrads and graduate students actually mingle.The decor is kind of dingy, but in a really endearing sort of way. All the seats have names and years carved into them, and the walls are covered in beer memorabilia. The food is pretty good for Campustown; I like the burgers and fries. They're appropriately greasy, and when on special you can't beat the price. The chicken fingers leave something to be desired but, hey, it's not perfect.What you go to Murphys for is the beer. The draft list is surprisingly extensive, and while the selection of hard alcohol is weak (says the guy who's finished a whiskey passport at Seven Saints), the specials are fantastic (you can normally get a double of either Beam or Wild Turkey for $5 or less) and they have specialty pints for $2.50 on Thursdays. And it's not bad beer either. I normally get Fat Tire or Angry Orchard, but they even have some decent IPA's on tap (sayeth my beer snob friends). Murphy's is often crowded, and for graduate students, there's a very real risk of running into students, but it's my favorite place in Campustown and a really good bar overall.", 
      "Aw Murphys, this was the first place I went to when I turned 19 and could get into the bars! \u00a0Love this place, totally low-key bar where you just sit, have a few beers and talk with friends. \u00a0\"Older\" crowd here too (compared to like Kams or Clybourne - is that still there?) \u00a0They also have a juke box, I don't know how many times we loaded Madonna songs :) \u00a0On my 21st bday we stayed til close, and they said on the PA \"it's closing time, but we'll let the jukebox keep playing because it's not Madonna\"Food is pretty good too, we'd go when the bacon cheeseburgers were on special - OMG so yummy and incredibly greasy. \u00a0They also have loaded waffle fries that are awesome.", 
      "Wow, I used to think that the Burger here was one of the best ever - not anymore. \u00a0I was in Champaign last week, on a Wednesday evening. \u00a0Murphy's was the only place with their kitchen open after 10pm. \u00a0I ordered a Mega Bacon Cheeseburger and fries. \u00a0Sat at the bar, and had to ask the bartender if he could please wipe off the bar in front of me because it was all messy - you would have thought I called him mother a dirty name. \u00a0Service here was terrible.The burger? \u00a0Much smaller than I remember. \u00a0The fries, barely edible....they were like eating balsa wood that had been deep fried. \u00a0All in all, a terrible meal. \u00a0I won't be returning, not with all the other places in town now where you can get some good eats."

      "I've never visited Murphy's during prime douche time, so its rating remains high. \u00a0I hope to never see it while extremely busy, because I'm 99% sure I'd hate it.I first went here the day after moving into town. \u00a0I was undernourished and exhausted. \u00a0Plus, we had to buy lunch for our two moving helpers. \u00a0So, imagine my elation upon arriving and finding that I could get a bacon cheeseburger and fries for $5. \u00a0We bought four big ass lunches for $20. \u00a0And it was actually good! \u00a0So satisfying was my first encounter with Murphy's.During the summer they have a great drink special every day. \u00a0You buy a mug filled with beer for $4 (or $6....damn, all that beer wiped my memory clean) and then get refills of Bells Oberon, Sam Adams and a few others for $2 all night. \u00a0Now that is a sexy drink special. \u00a0The ladies bathroom has graffiti on the ceiling that says something about being in love with LBJ. \u00a0Lyndon B. WAS a pretty man.... I guess.... :-/", 
      "The best bar on campus. Hands down. Their food is always tempting (typical pub food) but I usually come for the the beer and friends. The location is great and the atmosphere is better than the other campus bars. My one complaint is that they lack the depth and sophistication of the selections at other bars downtown. I don't mind my Blue Moon but somedays I want something a little more interesting than the usual suspects. If you are going to be around for awhile, learn about when the specials occur (Mug nights, half off bacon cheeseburgers, etc.). If you want to carry a casual meeting, this is a good location for lunch. The late afternoon and evening hours will be a little louder.", 
      "Murphy's is a great bar to go to if you just want to chill. \u00a0I've been to a couple fun happy hours here (but how can a happy hour not be fun?) and I've had some of their deliciously fried, greasey appetizers, too.There are plenty of booths and tables to sit and play some cards (drinking may or may not accompany said card games...) \u00a0Overall, it wouldn't be my first choice bar on the weekends, but maybe on a weekday. \u00a0The crowd is less \"Greek\", which doesn't really matter to me, but it's nice to point out.", 
      "No one has a huge affinity to this place but this is where we end up most of the time.Pros-Fairly good specials-Relatively low amount of bros-Greasy ass delicious foodCons-Seating is terrible on the weekends after 8-Dirty looking, but not necessarily dirty.Overall decent place to go, gets boring quick though since its a sit down bar, but too crowded to sit down a lot of times, and then its incredibly loud and hard to hold sit down conversations.Go there on a weeknight to get the optimal experience.", 
      "Murphy's was always my favorite bar in college, and when I returned recently it was just the same as I remember it. It's a divey atmosphere so they almost never have cover (only on Homecoming weekend and the like) and the vibe is very relaxed. Old school high top tables and wooden booths have been etched and written on until there's very little left of the original finish, but that's half the fun. They have great drink specials and amazing Irish nachos! I was feeling so nostalgic on my last visit here that I ended up coming two nights in a row. This is definitely the best bar on campus, hands down.", 
      "I was tempted to give this bar more stars considering it is the default bar for extremely casual affairs. They have pretty good drink specials and occasionally have good giveaways like Octoberfest, Winterfest, and St. Patrick's Day mugs. The tables are all carved by patrons trying to leave their mark on Green Street. Irish nachos come in huge servings. It's all good, but not really outstanding. I also feel like this place goes through an identity crisis with its loud blaring music that can shift from club music to country music (electronic jukebox-style). Don't come here if you expect to watch a sports event of some sort, but if you're looking for a place to drink and only drink, Murphy's will do.", 
      "With its scarred wood tables, friendly staff, blaring sports games, and dim lighting, Murphy's is a local institution. \u00a0It's also where history graduate students tend to congregate once a week, huzzah. \u00a0The beer/food specials are generally fantastic, and the grimy feel of the bar is palatable after a drink or two. \u00a0One caveat: they have the nastiest--nastiest bathroom. \u00a0It's hideous. \u00a0Ugh.", 
      "This is a great place to just chill whether it with friends or if you just failed an exam and you need a drank lol. They have great drink deals and good food too. I recommend trying the Irish nachos. They have different specials everyday too.", 
      "Decent drinks + chill atmosphere + Irish Nachos (oh God yes) + lack of sketchy people grinding on you = WIN.", 
      "a year later and I still loooove this place. \u00a0Got the turkey burger, yumm! \u00a0The fries has got to be the most deep fried small pieces of actual potato heaven I ever had and $3 pints of Guinness drafts.", 
      "In terms of campus bars, this is definitely my favorite bar to go to, especially now that I've been out of college for a few years. Is it the best bar in Champaign-Urbana? No, probably not, but if you're in the area, this is your spot. It's super low key, super pubby feeling, and usually has a nice mix of hipsters, sports fanatics, and average joes. The beers on tap are always good and remain pretty simple. They always have specials too, which is nice. I miss this place!", 
      "I still have dreams of Wednesday lunch. \u00a0Bacon Mega Cheeseburger and Fries for $4. \u00a0I would give my left arm for a Murphy Burger on some days.", 
      "Because I grew up on the South Side of Chicago, I consider myself part Irish. Nah, just kidding. But I have been to my share of Irish bars. I like Murphy's because it's low-key and they have good drink specials. I mean, on Thursdays you can pay 4.50 for a beer and get a glass. Then refills of said beer are only 2.50! Pretty sick. The next thing I've got to try here is the food. Also, they just opened a new part of the bar which looks really nice and opens up the space. I'll definitely be back.", 
      "Thursday $2 any pint and they have two brothers (and dead guy) on tap? Yesssss. Also their fries are probably the best on Green St and their burgers ain't too shabby either. The only thing I can't understand is the ridiculously long line to get in after 9pm, especially after the second bar opened inside... ohwell, grad students go early :)", 
      "great drink specials and good food! usually crowded, but never too noisy. a great local place for those group gatherings to meet up, drink up, eat up, and get out for a night on the town!", 
      "Perfect for a burger, fry and beer. \u00a0You can't go wrong. \u00a0Fries are great!", 
      "Go Mega, it's worth it. When the fries are done right , they're some of the best in town - and FREE with any sandwich every Sunday. \u00a0 The one fella has been there forever - I believe his name is Jim and he's an awful nice guy.My only lament is the loss of truly beer battered chicken fingers sometime \u00a0around the time they expanded. \u00a0Now they're just the frozen in a bag variety and not particularly notable.", 
      "I've been on campus since 2006, and Murphy's has yet to let me down. \u00a0From drink specials ($2 Woodchucks on Thursdays? I'm in!) to great food (I'm looking at you, Irish Nachos) to the atmosphere, you can count me in as a fan. The expansion has made it much easier to walk around the bar on the weekend nights when everyone is cramming in. Finding seating is less of a rat race, but I'd still say to arrive earlyish if you don't want to be standing. \u00a0The bathrooms can get a little sketchy, but I pretty much expect that from a campus bar. The jukebox has some interesting selections, and the music is usually good overall. It's my current favorite place to go and hang out with friends while not spending loads of money at the same time.", 
      "This is my choice for a beer and greasy pub-grub. \u00a0This is the only place around that has 1554 on tap, so I may be partial. \u00a0The food isn't anything to fawn over but is good (and cheap) enough to wash down with a beer.", 
      "Best burger and fries in town, hands down!", 
      "They call this an Irish pub but there's nothing Irish about it in my opinion. Honestly people don't care about the atmosphere, do they? They just come for the booze. They serve the typical junk food and it is very crowded during the weekends. They have a few specials too, so do check those out.", 
      "I have come here countless times over a 20-year span, from when it was a little campus bar to its current ever-expanding state. \u00a0Can't beat Wednesday night - Bacon Mega Cheeseburger special night. \u00a0Usually good fries, and the standard drinks. \u00a0A campus tradition, with all kinds of stuff carved into the booths. \u00a0You can't graduate from UI without having gone there at least once, preferably more.", 
      "Nothing really special. Its a college bar in a college town. The typical bar food, but fries come free with any sandwich on Sundays I think. I find it odd that your order from a window, and your number is called. I mean the place isn't exactly set up like Panera. Nevertheless, I was okay with my fish sandwich.", 
      "I'm a fan of this place. \u00a0It has a laid back atmosphere to combat the other bro-bars on campus, with a good beer list and decent food. \u00a0The inscribed wood on all of the tables tells me that this is a campus institution, as do the loyal community of regulars who hang out here. \u00a0 My only wish for the place is that the bartenders would know a bit more about what beers they serve. \u00a0When I asked what they had on tap (expecting to be handed a beer list) the bartender responded: \"I don't know...We have a lot\".", 
      "When I was in college I never suggested Murphy's but always ended up there because friends worked there. Decent food, semi-cheap, good strong drinks (if you know the bartenders) and decent specials. After 12 there are definitely lines Thursday-Saturday nights, it's usually one in, one out. If you get a booth, it's a good place to chill out, play card games, indulge in some greasy-ness and hang with friends. The music is pretty loud for a laid back bar, so you will leave with a hoarse voice, but oh well. An added bonus is they have photo hunt.", 
      "I worked here about three hundred years ago, and I thought it was the greatest bar ever at the time. However, it is not. However, it is still better than just about every other bar on campus, circa 2002. The burgers are phenemonal, as is the BBQ chicken.", 
      "Laid back atmosphere. That's what I remember. Maybe I was too buzzed. To remember.", 
      "One of the better bars on campus. Great food during the day, good drink specials. More casual than some of the other Green St. bars.", 
      "Meh, for a college town, this is doable for drinks and bar food. Nothing special, but I'm wondering what the differences are in color for the bar tabs.", 
      "Well, it's an institution here at the U of I. You can get cheap brewskis and cheap burgers and neither are bad. It's usually crowded Thursdays so I try to keep away.", 
      "Two ratings, from the perspective of a grad student:Week nights: Three stars. Good prices and decent (for a campus bar) food.Weekends: One star. Full of undergrads, stay away.I only come here for office happy hours during the week, since it is close.", 
      "Very good bar, and an institution at the U of I. \u00a0They've expanded so now there's more room to groove. Great-tasting burgers. \u00a0A bit on the small side, but if you get them as a special, it's worth it.", 
      "One of the best bars in campustown.... until friday and saturday nights.Most of the time its pretty relaxed and quiet. They have decent burgers and a fair selection of beers. Its close to anything on campus, so if you need a pint to commemorate the end of a project or test - its the place to go.That said, they make their money on all the younger students going out partying on weekends. \u00a0I head to downtown champaign for the weekends.", 
      "Wow, it's still here! \u00a0My husband bartended here 20 years ago, and yes they had long lines \u00a0back then too. \u00a0Happy to see it's still around.", 
      "Can't really state how much I love this place. Hang out here a couple times a week, as it is where my group of friends have always gone here. On weeknights the place is pretty clear--perfect for kicking a few back with some friends. You often see people bring in laptops to do work over a beer or two. It's generally quiet enough for that during the week. On weekends it's certainly busier and louder, but not unpalatable. Music isn't absolutely blasted, you can still have a conversation with the person next to you. If you are here for food, try the Irish nachos. Absolutely brilliant.", 
      "good times from college, my favorite bar in the area. always go there when i'm down and always made sure to bring out of town people there when i came. drinks will be the cheapest compared to everywhere else in the area. Food is pretty good but sometimes its hit and miss. i've had great irish nachos and i've had terrible irish nachos there. SERVICE IS TERRIBLE they are incredibly rude. 1st examplestanding at the bar watching a football game holding my money out on the counter so bartender knows i want a drink. next thing i know the bartender is in my face \"waving your money around wont get you served faster\". What the hell, i was standing there holding it on the bar, i wasn't even looking at you i was watching tv. 2nd examplecrowded for unofficial so i'm sure they are stressed. close out my tab, paid with a credit card but was going to leave a cash tip. Still reaching for my wallet bartender looks at 50 dollar tab with no tip. \"hey buddy, thats really a jerk thing to do, thanks\" again, what the hell! can i reach in my wallet to give you the cash, needless to say i said yeah your right and left without tipping. 3rd exampleusually the irish nachos are covered in toppings, most recent time hardly any. go back up to counter, its sunday no one is there so its not like its busy. Can i get some more toppings please i didn't get very much. Guy looks at me like i just punched his mother. answers slowly \"yeah... i guess i can\". he was pissed. Dude calm down i just want more toppings, didn't say it was terrible, get over yourself. thank god i love this place. except the servers. and not all are bad, just most.", 
      "The first rating was over-generous. \u00a0It's still good, but three stars seem more appropriate than four.", 
      "Big fan of this place. \u00a0They've expanded since I went to school here, which is fantastic since the overall feel is less crowded. \u00a0The more people you can fit in the bar, the shorter the line outside! \u00a0I haven't had food here in years, but I know it's super cheap. \u00a0Drinks are cheap too, decent draft beer selection for a campus bar, and it's surprisingly not that hard to snag a table (there are a whole bunch of them). \u00a0I've had many an evening here, dancing in that space in front of the jukeboxes. \u00a0And you should know that this is not a place where a lot of people dance - it's mostly just people drinking, probably shaking their heads and laughing at my friends and I dancing around like idiots to Bon Jovi. \u00a0But you know, Murphy's just makes me feel comfortable enough to do that. \u00a0The jukebox blows on busy nights though - even if you pay extra for \"play next,\" like 10 other people already did that so you might not hear your songs at all. \u00a0And you'll probably have to sit through a lot of stupid crap that other people picked out before you get to any good music. \u00a0I guess it just depends on the crowd. \u00a0Either way, we always stop at Murphy's when we come back to Champaign and I know we always will!", 
      "Great Irish Pub right in the heart of campus! This bar is almost always packed, especially if there is a good game on! The food is awesome too for bar food. They have a great chicken sandwich with french fries. Add a tastey Guiness to complete your meal!",

      "To start being carded was funny. But that is what some places do. Flat Top is a decent make your own stir fry. Grab your bowl and fill it up with whatever you like and as much \u00a0as you like, Witnessed a young lady prepare enough in her bowl to last a week. But if it fits do it. Place meat in a separate bowl leave on counter and wait for the cook to prepare. Decent food the rice was scary as it looked as if it had been there over night. We did get a freshly cooked bowl and it tasty smokey. Ok place nothing special.", 
      "Ok meal, mediocre service, lying hostess. Went as part of a group of 6 for a birthday dinner. Stephanie the server was helpful but very busy. We ordered three appetizers for the table. As we were dropping off our bowls to be cooked, the appetizers were being finished. I saw them sitting on the counter, And had a seat where I could see them sit. And sit. Finally the hostess-like person picked the plates up and took the appetizers on a tour of the restaurant. Finally, she brought the cold food to our table. The edamame, quesadillas, and dumplings all had a glaze from the now chilled oil, and all were soggy and cool to the touch. I asked her why they sat for so long, and that's when the real problem started- she LIED and said they just came up. I confronted her and told her that I had watched them sit for 6-8 minutes before she brought them to us, and she stated again that they were fresh. I can understand a service delay when a restaurant is busy, but bad service from a lazy and dishonest employee has no place in the service industry. I confronted her and asked for contact information for the manager, and in return she avoided our table the rest of the meal, hiding in the back room and continuing to avoid her responsibilities. \u00a0It's disappointing that this type of behavior is tolerated by what used to be an amazing restaurant. \u00a0 The restaurant made no attempt to make things right, except to eventually replace the tepid food after our entrees arrived.", 
      "I waited a while to write my review to make sure this was actually what I wanted to say. These kids running this donkey show pissed me the hell off. It was just after 4 on a Saturday and we came in to have what I thought would be the only intelligent offering in a town full of children. Right! We were seated and I was one of 4 guests in the building. Our drink order was taken, and because I was in my booth so tight that I didn't want to get up to show my I.D. I changed my order to Sierra Mist! I guess the 4 inches of grey hair hanging from my chin wasn't proof enough that I am not only old enough to drink. But I am also old enough to operate an electric wheel chair! But that had nothing to do with the annoyance factor that was brewing. The kid explained what we had to do and we went on our way. Now I love rice. So much so that I could eat that alone as my meal. Both the white and brown rice tubs were completely empty! So I asked for some and was told they would bring it right out. Then I was told to make my bowl and they would bring it out when it was ready. So I asked a simple question. If you bring it out after the meal is cooked. Than the rice will still be white! With no flavor from what I put in the bowls. Three people told me that it would take 25 minutes to cook the damn rice and they all thought it was hysterical. The manager. A young girl with her hair pulled back to give her that look of authority kept pacing back and forth through the restaurant like she actually had something important to offer. The rice. Is an, if not thee essential part of what this chains menu is built upon! And then you do a group huddle to laugh about it. Now I could see my bowl from across the restaurant sitting on the edge of the griddle. When about thirty people walk in. The cook is still scraping the grill from the time I walked in the door and I knew what was going to happen next. Bowl after bowl about 8 inches higher than the rim were pushing mine further and further away from getting cooked. That's was it. I'm the dude in the Snickers commercial that needs to be fed. But. I kept my cool. Just not my Snidely Whiplash remarks. Every time a server walked by, I asked if the rice was ready yet? I cut the time of that rice down to 15 minutes and that shit was scorched like their underwear after a weekend binge! Of course when it came out I was finished with my meal. I thought that it would be fun to visit a college town and take in some sights. Fuck You! I told my buddy to get the car and lets get the hell out of here!", 
      "If I could give this place no stars, I would. I used to enjoy Flattop, a couple of years ago Flattop really wasn't bad at all! You filled a bowl with vegetables, beans, rice, and sauce. You'd fill a smaller bowl with your choice of meats, then leave them on the side for them to be stir fried into really delicious meal. That is not the case anymore, now you get back a \u00a0bowl of really BLAND, overcooked stuff. It doesn't even taste like stir fry, just like a bunch of dried up random bits of food. I had convinced my friend to go here instead of Chipotle and then felt really embarrassed when he had to get up to get extra sauce from the station because his food was that dry. The meal was so bad and took so long, the least I could do was pay for both our meals. Never again will I be coming back here.",

I love the options for ingredients which always seem pretty fresh and sauces and the veggie \"meat\" options are outstanding but the bowl is VERY small for $12.99. I think a better price would be the lunch price of $8.99 and unlimited for $12.99. I would go more often if it weren't so expensive.", 
      "Very vegetarian-friendly. \u00a0They cook vegetarian meals on a separate part of the grill. \u00a0Basically, you fill a small bowl with rice, noodles, veggies, meat substitutes (they also have meat options), and add the sauce of your choice. \u00a0You can make your meal into a soup, lettuce wraps, or mushu wraps. \u00a0Great concept! \u00a0They also have an unlimited option, but I find that one bowl is usually more than enough. \u00a0You can also add tofu or eggs to your dish as well. \u00a0Priced a little high for non-students.", 
      "The food there is unclean. My stomach feels bad after eating at there and I will never go this place again!", 
      "Good qualityGood variety of choicesI have had brunch, lunch and dinner at this place and absolutely love it :)", 
      "Looked on their web site and went there for their Sunday breakfast, got there at 10:40 and they were setting up for Lunch. \u00a0 They said they opened at 11:00, we said we were there for the Sunday breakfast, they responded that they have not done that since sometime in the summer. \u00a0We mentioned that their web site said htey still did it and the response was that corporate had not fixed it yet.Caused us to miss the breakfast buffet at other places.Very poor attitude and no offer of \"I'm sorry, we need to get that taken care of.\"", 
      "The stir fry is decent. If you aren't very confident in your own stir fry ability, then I suppose this place is a good once-in-a-while excursion (especially the sauces). Provided you don't have any food allergies. Although they claim to cook orders for people with food allergies in separate woks, there have been a couple of times when I or someone in my party got the wrong order. Along with that, there is a lot of mess and cross contamination when people are loading up their bowls.But if you do decide to take the plunge, the roti bread and the mu-shu options are pretty good. $15 good? Maybe not for me.", 
      "The restaurant of last resort.", 
      "Flat Top Grill is one of the best places to go on a weeknight. I have gone with friends and my girlfriend many times and every time it is delicious. Every time I have made my own stir fry which I seem to perfect the more I eat there. Make sure to load up on vegetables and meat because you only get one shot to make it count. For the price you can get four separate meals if you make your bowls the right way. The sauces are good and the bread is heavenly. Get the bread. If you haven't been there yet it is worth the trip.", 
      "Flat Top is kitschy and pretends to be a bit more cosmopolitan than a chain restaurant in a midsize Midwestern college town should be.However, I'm amused at the harsh criticism. \u00a0If the food isn't good--guess whose fault it is? \u00a0YOURS.Basically, Flat Top is a gussfied take on the old Mongolian Stir Fry concept. \u00a0However, there are pretty extravagant options. \u00a0You can get everything from peanut sauce, indian curry, teriyaki, or even the sublimely odd choices of pomegranate basil and \"vindahoo\" (a miswritten version of \"Vindaloo\"--yes, I kept saying \"Vindawhat? Vindahoo?\" until Archana asked me to stop). \u00a0There's a huge amount of protein options, a variety of carbs (noodles of various kinds and types of rice).The drinks are pretentious and overstuffy, but the fruit flavored lemonades are fantastic. \u00a0Also, for an obesity overload you should get a pseudo-roti bread concoction on the side. \u00a0It's free and DELICIOUS.Anyway, give Flat Top a chance. \u00a0It's well worth it. \u00a0Although a bit pricey, it's a bit tasty--if you know what you're doing.", 
      "***Full Disclosure: I used to work for Flat Top Grill for nearly six years until April 2011, spanning its old and current ownership, but not at this location***My buddy Sven and I came to town the other night and decided to stop in for dinner. \u00a0He had been eating unhealthily all day and we both knew that FTG was a place to both eat healthy and make yourself a large quantity of food for your money, if that's your sort of thing.We stopped in around 8:30 on a Saturday night. \u00a0There appeared to be only one server, one bartender and a manager on the floor. The manager appeared to be wearing many hats, seating, serving and bussing tables.Ok, most people are familiar with the process by now. \u00a0The food was good. \u00a0Our server Toni was good. \u00a0Honestly, the only reason I'm giving such a low rating is because the place looked like a disaster area. \u00a0It looked like a tour bus full of people had just left the place. \u00a0Dirty tables everywhere, trails of water and food debris all over the floor. \u00a0The bar area had 10 or so seats, with four of them covered by clipboards, paperwork, and other bar stuff. \u00a0While our server, the bartender and the manager are all trying to make some sense of the place, I head to the bathroom and the busboy is in the back of the room on his phone.The spot in the worst shape was the food line. \u00a0There were veggies all over the counter, sauces splattered all over, a few items were missing tongs, and there was only one guy on a full grill on a Saturday night.If you think about it, there's only one thing FTG offers, and that's the fresh food line. \u00a0If that looks unappealing, then the whole concept looks bad. \u00a0Someone with bad OCD that night would've probably had a Rain Man-style attack.For all the times I visit Champaign (once a year), I'll write off this visit. \u00a0I've been to FTG's that are immaculate, and ones that need some work. \u00a0This one could definitely use a hand.", 
      "Came here for breakfast-tranisition-to-lunch, but what was nice was that we just had to pay one price to try out both selections. \u00a0However they charged us all for the multiple-plate deal even though I didn't partake in it, which wasn't really too much damage (just a dollar more), and we all got student discounts despite half of us being young looking alumni.I think it all evened out.Breakfast was interesting. \u00a0Couple of guys had omelets, the girls all got pancakes (which prove useful since they could try the lunch after), and I got an egg scramble with loads of veggies, which counteracted all the beer and fat sandwich tasting the night before. \u00a0Right? \u00a0Unlike lunch, they set out a bunch of sweet stuff to go in the pancakes, like chocolate chips and nuts. \u00a0You also get fresh fruit with the meal for free.Protip I did not know: all the little sticks for extras come with what you pay. \u00a0I wish I had got some sausage. \u00a0Also, I barely got any hash browns.Lunch came around but I was stuffed. \u00a0We did discover some things: if you use the soup stick, you don't get a side of soup; they turn your ingredients into a soup. \u00a0Also, they have longganisa! \u00a0They call it Filipino sausage, which it is, but I was extremely excited to see some love for some of the best Asian food no one's tried. \u00a0It's leaner than the kind I usually have, which makes it a bit less authentic, but probably healthier.Overall, service was ok, but we didn't receive much instruction despite it being the first time for most of us. \u00a0My breakfast turned out all right, though I can't see if they did anything special besides scrambling my \u00a0ingredients with eggs and serving it to me. \u00a0The lunch seemed a lot more interesting with all the sauces and longganisa, though I think we did the right thing by trying both in one seating.We were also pretty hungover, so that helped.", 
      "The good thing about Flat Top is that you make your own food. \u00a0However, the bad thing about Flat Top is that you make your own food. \u00a0You can pick whatever you want for your stir-fry (soup, etc) so you get exactly what you want (though I always end up with corn in my stir fry even though I never add it myself). \u00a0The problem is, sometimes it's nice to have somebody tell you what works well together.I pretty much only come here when I have a coupon. \u00a0It's not that it's too expensive or the food is bad, I just get a little sick of it because I always have so much leftover that I'm eating it for days. \u00a0Also, apparently I'm not very creative when it comes to stir fry because I always end up making pretty much the same thing. \u00a0I'll be honest, it gets kind of boring. \u00a0But, the veggies always seem fresh and the sausage they have at dinner is pretty tasty. \u00a0Sometimes, though, it seems like my meat doesn't get cooked all the way through.That said, here's some pro tips:- Always, always, always ask for more bread- The rice seems to be a better choice than the white noodles if you're going to have leftovers, since the noodles tend to clump together and get really mushy- Place the veggies in your bowl first, and add the rice or noodles on top. \u00a0You can fit so much more in your bowl this way.", 
      "Not sure why all the negative reviews! I recently visited for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. You can purchase \"one bowl\" or \"unlimited\". Unlimited is a far better value for the money (as you could probably guess). While there are helpful signs to give you suggestions on what to create, it was more fun to mix and match unique combinations! As a vegetarian, I thought there was a fabulous selection of veggies, and even tofu. What a fun experience!", 
      "This is a make your own stir fry restaurant. A friend and I went for lunch, while the place was crowded, the service was highly attentive and generally excellent. There is something to appeal to almost everyone among the stir fry ingredients - and for a couple of dollars more you can make an unlimited number of trips back to the stir fry bar. Unlike a few places I've been, Flattop doesn't make you wait - the bowl is marked with your name and table so it comes to you when ready. Also, if you're not into stir fry, you have the option to have your meal presented to you as a salad, soup, mu shu pancake filling, or with a roti prata. Also, they have a full drink menu and a selection of appetizers and deserts.The best thing I can say in this review is that I'll definitely be returning soon.", 
      "The food is alright, but it's probably only worth the price if you get the discount with student id, have a coupon for half off, or have a coupon for a free stir fry. \u00a0Have been there a few times in the last few months (because I had a coupon for a free stir fry), and the service was terrible each time. \u00a0The waiter forgot to bring water/drinks to the table several times, after walking by and reassuring us that he'll be right back with water. \u00a0The waiter never came to check up on us throughout the meal to see if we needed anything, and we needed more water at several points. \u00a0As for my food the last time, it was not that great. \u00a0The sauce combo that i made was not good, and i should have had one of the servers mix my sauces (make your own sauces can really be hit or miss). \u00a0Finally, when we asked for our check, it took our waiter another 20 minutes to bring it, then another 10 to bring a carry-out box. \u00a0Overall, the stir fry is decent, but i would recommend having a server prepare your sauce mixture (whenever I prepare it, it never comes out quite right), and prepare yourself for not-so-great service because the servers are mostly college students who are working for mediocre tips.", 
      "It's all about customization here. \u00a0You can create one bowl of stir fry goodness or for $2 more, an unlimited number of bowls. \u00a0After assembling various grains, veggies, and meat, you have the option of putting other add-ons into your meal, represented by different colored sticks. \u00a0I've always been a fan of the blue stick - roti flatbread (beware: it is kinda greasy).This Flat Top has a roomy interior, but the L-shaped buffet bar is cramped. \u00a0They always have exotic beverages here, like desert pear, pomegranate, or chipotle pineapple lemonade, margaritas, and mojitos. Refreshing and trendy!", 
      "This is the first restaurant I have possibly ever been to where I felt actively annoyed by the waitstaff. \u00a0You'd think that was impossible, since it's a flippin' buffet, but lo. \u00a0The woman whose job it was to fill up our drinks managed to only ever reach for my glass when it was going to involve sticking her arm between my chopsticks and my mouth. \u00a0Some man came over and engaged us in a lengthy dialectic about whether or not we would like him to make us some dipping sauce. \u00a0What flavors do you like? \u00a0How spicy do you want it? \u00a0For 5 minutes after our food came, during which we couldn't eat! \u00a0Then he brought us over dishes of sauce that WE COULD HAVE SELECTED OURSELVES from the buffet!Additionally, I was unsatisfied with my food. \u00a0I followed one of the sauce suggestions at the buffet, and was treated to a steaming pile of oily stir fry that literally smelled like the nasty gunk that gets stuck in a horse's shoe when it walks through a cow pasture. \u00a0The pineapple in the buffet was from a can, the meat was a low grade cut, and there was about 100 times too much oil applied to the grill. \u00a0The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is that it's got an ambience that is well above the campus mean.", 
      "I don't get why this place has gotten such harsh reviews. \u00a0While it's nothing special, it's really not that bad of a place to go on a date or grab dinner with friends as it's a new/different experience for many, its got a great location right off of Green, and you'll definitely be able to leave satisfied with a stomach full of some pretty good stuff (that is, if you know what you're doing).A design your own stir-fry chain, Flat Top offers a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and protein for your creation - all of which are fresh - and they even provide some pre-designed recipes such as Kung Pao Chicken or Peanutty Lime Noodles. \u00a0Personally, I find these recipes are only okay, so I mix and match for myself.Make sure you load up your bowl (till one extra grain of rice will send the entire thing crashing down), because, while it may look like you have a lot on there already, when everything is cooked, it shrinks in size and you'll be left with half of what you thought you were going to get and don't forget to put a blue stick in your bowl at the end! \u00a0It's Roti Prata which is athin Indian flat bread that's really really good! \u00a0And they even have breakfast now at certain locations! \u00a0I have yet to try it, but I love love love breakfast foods and this seems like it'd be an interesting experience!The downsides to this place though, is how incredibly crowded it always is. \u00a0In order to get a table if you're with a big group (which is usually the case), you have to wait around an hour to get seated and there is hardly any room to maneuver around as the tables are places so close together. \u00a0The wait staff is nice, but not always attentive as they're so busy with other customers as well. \u00a0Also, forget about coming here if you want to be able to converse with your friends as opposed to shouting across the table in order to be heard. \u00a0For the student price and what you receive, I would say it's a good deal and would come more often, but the long wait and packed seating makes it so that I only make it out there maybe once or twice a semester.", 
      "So yummy cuz I made it myself.I just finished a box of takeout Flat Top goodness. \u00a0The last time I had Mongolian style fare was in Whistler on my honeymoon five years ago, and I loved it today as much as I did then.I would think it is hard to go wrong when I am essentially making my own lunch. \u00a0At least for me. \u00a0My husband went yesterday with a group of people and had quite a wait to get seated and started. \u00a0He also somehow managed to spoon in ladles of hot mustard in his dish, thinking \"I like hot mustard.\" \u00a0It was painful to eat. \u00a0He ended up having to start over again with help from staff to guide him to make a more palpatable plate.Today, it was all about a ladle of lemongrass water, ginger water, Korean BBQ sauce, and peanut sauce, and a touch of the really hot chili sauce. \u00a0A ton of veggies I love, enough meat to feel like I'm getting my meal's worth, and a shake of sesame seeds and I was done. \u00a0The waiter put some extra brown rice in the bowl, so I didn't have to waste valuable single bowl space with rice. \u00a0It was sooooooo good. \u00a0And hot. \u00a0Temperature is important to me.I did takeout and therefore chose the 1 bowl option, which was under $7 without tax, $7.57 with tax. \u00a0They packaged it up in a very stylish shopping bag. \u00a0Like, it's nice and sturdy enough to replace my bare hand to awkwardly carry extra shoes, lunch, and a sweater to work.Anyway, I work in Campustown, and Flat Top is convenient value for the money. \u00a0There seemed to be a lot of folks coming in to sit down for lunch. \u00a0Hubby had to wait 30 minutes yesterday. \u00a0I probably spent about 25 minutes roundtrip from my office door on Green Street to Flat Top and back. I would recommend it for takeout lunch. \u00a0It seems a bit daunting for newbies, but they get through the line the same as the rest of us, and the host gave me a short orientation before I built my bowl. \u00a0Looking at how the place is designed as an operations model, I could definitely see opportunities to improve throughput. \u00a0But eh, I'm not in that business. \u00a0I'm in the business of locating the good eatz and then savoring them with gusto.Which is what I did. \u00a04 stars.", 
      "I really LOVE this place in terms of food and the variety of options you have with creating your own stir-fry. \u00a0 The food is prepared for you very quickly too, even when they are busy. \u00a0 What I can't stand about this place is that they ALWAYS sit us directly next to other people. \u00a0 And when I mean next to other people, I mean right up on top of them. \u00a0There is a lot of seating but we always end up next to people, regardless. \u00a0 It's close enough that you can't have a comfortable conversation with the person you are with. \u00a0They need to change that. \u00a0Otherwise, it's a great place to have a meal.", 
      "Worst stir fry I have ever eaten.The selections are bizzare (pomegranate basil??) and the \"sticks\" are useless if no one tells you what they are and misleading. The final result was disappointing and tasted awful.If you want to experience \"make your own stir fry\" I recommend Northbrook Court's \"Stir Crazy\" or Ann Arbor's \"Mongolian Barbeque.\" Much better. Cheaper. Tastier.", 
      "This gets1 star due to pricing and because this is the ONLY restaurant I have been to where they charge you DOUBLE for sharing your food with your spouse! \u00a0They literally tried charging me double the price for the same amount of food my friends received because I shared my bowl with my spouse. \u00a0I argued my point and only paid the normal amount but they said \"now you know for next time\". \u00a0There will be no next time for me.", 
      "I've eaten at several \"make your own stir fry\" type of places before coming to Champaign-Urbana, and Flat Top was certainly one of them. Back at home, I was pretty willing to pay the $12-13 for this pleasure since there was a lack of asian restaurants that I really liked.However, I am now surrounded by many relatively high quality thai, chinese, and korean restaurants that are also pretty cheap, and with that in mind, it's hard for me to justify paying more to eat at a restaurant like this.Yes, you do have the freedom to build your own stir fry here, but if you don't know what you are doing (which will probably be the case your first time), then you'll probably end up putting too little noodles or too much sauce in your bowl and end up with a mess. Of course, even if your stir fry comes out perfectly, I can't say you are going to get your money's worth unless you are hungry enough to finish a second helping for a mere $2 extra. However, even that has its caveats as if you choose to take home anything you don't finish, you'll have to pay $5 extra which will only promote wasting food in my opinion.Still, you may be allured by the freedom of handpicking your ingredients every once and a while, and it's a pretty fun place to go to with your friends.", 
      "The food is pretty good. The prices are kinda shitty. The organization and constant screwups is what turns a potential 4 star into a 2 star. The last 4 times I have gone at least one order has been messed up, usually more.Issues range from the meat bowls being entirely mixed up between unrelated orders or forgetting to add the bread to them mixing up how you wanted yours served, like turning it into a soup. Depending on what the screw up is, you'll have to remake your entire bowl and wait a good 30 minutes, made even worse if you are dining with people whose orders turned out fine and will either have to wait for you or just go on ahead without you. They'll usually comp your meal to some degree, but it's still not really worth it. The inside of the restaurant is terribly laid out. Some space is completely unused, whereas the food bar area where you create your bowl is so cramped it's uncomfortable. Foods are jammed so close together they inevitably get mixed, including the sauces and meats which could be a big issue for people with dietary restrictions (especially considering that they seem to try to make it a very accommodating experience to such people otherwise)", 
      "There's nothing particularly unique about this Flat Top location compared to all the others, but that's no surprise from a chain restaurant. The size of the space is good, the waitress was really nice (automatically gave us the student price - which itself wasn't terrible for a sit-down restaurant), and it all seemed to go as it should at Flat Top.The concept itself isn't bad; when I was younger I thought Flat Top was the ultimate in food fabulousness. Now that I've been in college and made more than enough \"let me throw every thing I can find into a pan with some rice and soy sauce and call it stir fry\" meals, the excitement has worn a little thin. Of course, the vegetables are much more varied and fresh, the sauce selection is massive (just don't think about Sauceman's from Tom Goes to the Mayor), and they give you lots of special options that most college students probably wouldn't be able to do. Plus, you know, not having to cook or clean dishes yourself.I like the place, I'd recommend it to people for what it is, and I'd certainly go again myself. Also, I've heard good things about their breakfast...maybe next time?", 
      "Most Flat Tops, I'd give a five star rating since I love the place. I won't go into a huge explanation into why since everyone else has, but a word of warning (and the reason this is a four start place for me):Every time I (or whoever I'm with) add chicken to my stir fry, there are bits of bone. I've never had this problem at any other Flat Top, so when I'm at this location I just leave out the chicken, but if you still want it, just be careful for bits of bone. (Though my friend that got chicken with bone in it complained and his meal was free, so it's nice that they're at least sorry it happens, if they're not fixing the issue.)", 
      "Yet another Asian-inspired food chain! Oh c'mon do we need this in Champaign? We have so many Chinese/Korean restaurants in campustown and honestly, they are way better than Flat Top. So, the whole stir-fry concept that they have is actually Mongolian BBQ. The difference is that they have tonnes of raw vegetables and ingredients to choose from. Oh, not to mention, weird sauces and food combinations. My combo was okay (it was brown rice, clams, beef, vege, salmon and roti prata) but if you don't have a sense of what goes with what, then your dinner is going to be a disaster. It's clever of them to have this pick-your-own-ingredients kinda concept because if the food was bad and you complained, they can point their fingers back at you and say that you chose the ingredients. Then again, you are not the only culprit. The grill sensei is responsible as well. If he over-grilled your food, it will taste just as bad no matter how wonderful your selections are. My friend's moo shu was not wrapped very well and some of the rolls fell apart. Well, there goes your dinner. I think it is good to try it once but more that once? You decide. Still, the combo of rice, salmon and roti prata bothers me. Maybe I am just a stuck-up purist who thinks that chickpea dhal is the only way to go. Could this be a one-hit wonder like Bar Louie? We'll have to see.", 
      "I've eaten at two other Flat Top Grills before (wow I never knew it was 3 words before...) and I'm sure most of the reviews below mine have explained how the food and the make-your-own bar work, so I'll simply share a few thoughts about how this Flat Top differed from my others:- Lots of dining space, far more than I expected, looking in from the street- Great location, easily found a place to park my car- Good service, the waiter even kept a stream of punny jokes (based of my initial one) throughout the entire dinner. \u00a0That deserves major props in my book!The only flaw in my dining experience? I felt a bit rushed to leave the restaurant during a late dinner hour. \u00a0While I personally would have ignored it and continued on with my conversation, my partner insisted that we leave to be considerate. \u00a0Not exactly how I wanted to end a dinner date...", 
      "Please note that If you aren't a college student then this place is NOT really expensive!Flat Top is a chain, but it hasn't made it to Michigan yet (darn). \u00a0When I'm in town for work, I strong arm my local friends into coming here for lunch. \u00a0We usually do the one trip because of time constraints.FT has a very nice selection of veggies and unique sauces. \u00a0The protein choices are regular, but fresh. \u00a0Yes, you pay a little extra if you want shrimp, and then they only give you a skewer... so stick with the chicken if you're cheap.What sets FT apart from the Mongolian-type places in Michigan is that you choose how you want your final dish to turn out - in a hot and sour soup, in a vegetable soup, on top of a salad, moo shu style, or just regular stir-fry in a bowl. \u00a0I've gotten the veggie soup my last couple of trips because I think the broth goes very well with the sauces I choose (spicy hot and savory, not sweet). \u00a0And their flat bread is amazing. \u00a0We always ask for extra, extra, extra!", 
      "Flat Top Grill is a new addition to campustown. allowing you to create your own stir fry from a variety of interesting ingredients and sauces. You put all your ingredients in a bowl, add some sauce, and perhaps pick a custom option such as having your stir-fry as soup or in a peking pancake. The variety of sauces and options allow you to experiment with fusions- Indian, Thai, and Chinese options are available. \u00a0I had snowpeas, spinach, cilantro, carrots, pork, and a heap of spicy vindaloo sauce with an Indian roti pancake, which was delicious and filling. However, quality varies...sometimes the grill will overcook the food or mix it with someone else's (yuck!). Overpriced stirfry? Maybe...most of us could do better at home. When your dish is done they bring it to you. Service is good and you can also get drinks and appetizers if your stir-fry isn't enough. While it is a chain, it seems much fresher than nearby Noodles & Co. The major problems? Vegetarians get a bowl of what is essentially vegetables and sauce, which is not a good deal for the price. Crowds can also get horrendous, so make reservations for evenings and on weekends.I also recently tried breakfast here, which really wasn't worth the price. You can get french toast, omelets, pancakes, and scrambled eggs with add-in. There are also snacks like fruit and muffins for while you wait. My scrambled eggs were more like flattened eggs because of the amount of cheese they added and the french toast was a little boring. Not worth 8.99 unless you are willing to eat a lot.", 
      "I've always liked make-your-own stirfry places like this, for the ultimate power to choose how your food came out. This allowed me to keep coming to this place, as I made crappy dish after crappy dish.Then, I learned to make healthier mixes. Then I learned to make TASTIER mixes. And then, Flat Top Grill became a much more enjoyable place! For the price, few places can match the quality or quantity.Learn the right sauce mixes, and your experiences here will be gold.", 
      "Forty-five minutes for flavorless stir fry, really?", 
      "This place gives you amazing food with a unique experience! The food is like an Americanized Mongolian BBQ type of ordeal. You start off with an empty bowl and chose whatever you want to go in your dish with your choice of meats, vegetables, noodles, and sauces. Then, they have a big grill where someone cooks it for you.They always have great service here as well. I am always pleased with the service I receive when I come here. They don't have a big alcohol menu, however, the alcoholic beverages they do have are quite tasty. And this is a great place for students to go and enjoy time out with their friends given that they do have a student discount.", 
      "This is a great place to come if you aren't in a rush, but need something relatively healthy. The vegetables are usually fresh and well-separated. Meat is abundant, as are a wide array of sauces. The service is decent, but at lunch expect a bit of a wait for seating and then actual eating.My one recommendation care of friends and loved ones is to not get potatoes. They will not be fully cooked and consequently, the food will taste kind of nasty.", 
      "AYCE breakfast for $9.99? yes please! this is the first time i've had breakfast at flat top and i was pleasantly surprised. lots of items to choose from. you can get eggs scrambled or in an omelette. there's pancakes, french toast, etc. the options are endless. service was alright. our waitress was a little too chipper for a sunday morning which got on my nerves a bit but thats not her fault. i was just trying to recover from a crazy saturday night. =P"

      "I adore the budaejigae here! If you must order something, get that. For those who don't know what it is, it's basically ramen mixed with sausage, pork belly, spam, dumplings, and vegetables. You can also choose the level of spiciness of the broth. For the typical broke college student, the prices are low compared to other places on campus and they give you a lot of food all for under $10. If I had to rate the budaejigae, I'd give it five stars based on taste and the sides offered along with it. Also, there was so much, I had to take home half in a box.It's true the owner isn't very talkative, but that's due to a language barrier and it's not fair to deduct any stars for that. There's also no waiter service, but it's a casual restaurant, so this is to be expected. Another thing to note is that it's very clean compared to other places, which is a nice touch. It's not the best Korean food I've had, but it's quite filling especially when you've got an urge to get Korean food.", 
      "Restaurant reviewMy first venture into Korean food in Champaign was good. We decided to stop for a quick lunch and ended up at the first restaurant that opened at 11 AM on a weekday. It was easy to order because we were the first customers of the day. They have a nice laminated menu at the desk to chose your entree. It would be nicer if they had pictures instead of a word description of each item. I selected the combo platter of bulgogi which was 9.99. Afterwards it was a long wait of approximately 25 minutes before we got our food. The dish itself came with a large amount of rice and 2 ban chae along with a bean soup. Based on the pictures I could have chose the beef bulgogi paid less and likely gotten the same amount of food except less variety. The bulgogi was well seasoned, but the meat was cut into smaller slices which detracted from it. Prices have gone up according to my wife since she was in college. Overall slightly above average, I will have to find another korean restaurant to compare too.Pro: average price korean food, large portionCons: long cook time, higher price than average lunch placesHidden gem:Your meal comes with rice, soup, and 2 korean ban chae", 
      "Daily special number 1 is the way to go! It comes with half a mackerel, and a decent bowl of tofu soup. The mackerel can be dry at times though. The kimchi jjigae has a large portion and tastes good too.", 
      "arirang is in a good location and i love their no. 7 (grilled mackerel with assorted kimchi). i tried my favorite korean dish here (bbq chicken and dak kalby) but i didn't like them that much. the downside is the owner/cashier doesn't appear, in fact isn't, friendly.", 
      "Food is decent. Serving time is mediocre at best. Bibimbap sauce literally redeemed my meal. Price is somewhat higher than expected.", 
      "There are many Korean restaurants on campus that are readily accessible for students at UIUC. The market itself is a war zone. With that said, each and every one of those would try to have their specialty to out-do the others. A-Ri-Rang, in my opinion, does stand out compare to its competitors in its own unique way. In my personal opinion, I find A-Ri-Rang to be much cleaner than its competitors. Furthermore, the layout of the tables were done in such a way that it would not block incoming traffic, which, if you are a regular at Woorijib, would probably understand what I mean. Every day, there is always a lunch special going on. And it is most definitely worth every penny! For approximately $7-8 dollars, you would get a bowl of rice, a fish, and a soup of choice. Now, this may not sound like a lot, but the soup that comes with it is more like a stew. I always get the Soon-dobu jigae (forgive me if I spelled it right). In English? Tofu Stew. It is a LOT more filling than you think if you never had it before. Trust me on this. If there is anything you really need to know about A-Ri-Rang, is that their stew/soup food items are superior than their competitors. Therefore, if you are not sure what you want to get, if you stick with this guideline, you really can't go wrong!With reasonable price and delicious food, I would highly recommend this place to anyone!", 
      "i used to come here a lot when i was living in Urbana area, i had tried pretty much everything on the menu. Fried rice, stir fry noodle, bibibam, noodle soup, bugulgi and lots more. Fried rice maybe my least favorite thing among all other dishes iv had (they r really lack of flavors, and there is nothing special about them) bibibam was okay, noodles are always my favorite (soup, stir fry, doesn't matter, it's always enjoyable) I also like their steam rice, and the marinate potato side dish. (not so much about the radish tho) overall, a good place to grab a quick lunch/dinner and have a decent Korean meal.", 
      "Looking for Korean Food? Want Budaejigae? If So, order here! I'm not korean but this is my favorite place for Budaejigae, I've only ordered a couple other things here, and comparatively to the other Korean places in town, this place hands down, has the best Budaejigae. For me personally, I would rather go to woorijib for korean bbq (bulgogi / kalbi) and would definitely come here for the Budaejigae.Cheap and its huge, definitely can't go wrong if you are looking for a spicy noodle meat soup.", 
      "I've been to A-Ri-Rang several times now and I have to say that I am not a fan. None of the dishes are particularly great, and I would even dare to say that most are vastly bland by Korean standards (my S. Korean friend really didn't like the beef bulgogi). Being that it takes a very long time to get your food, and that finding seats for groups larger than 2 people is nearly impossible, I am not likely to return -- There are definitely better Korean restaurant in the extreme vicinity.", 
      "Self service for cost effective. A lot of steam rice. good!! \u00a0 \u00a0, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 . \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0. \u00a0 +.", 
      "Cheap and hits the spot . I think it's one of the most affordable Korean restaurants on campus. For a college kid, it's a huge win.A-ri-rang offers most of the staple Korean items on their menus, from the broth-based dishes to the bibimbap to the bulgolgi meals. I think the omu rice here is pretty clutch too.", 
      "I used to come to this place before I found out about other Korean places around campus. Each place has their own specialties. I love getting the bibimbap and bulgogi from here. In my opinion, the soon du bu doesn't have much flavor. I started coming less and less because the owner at this place isn't too friendly. Also, once I came to get food and saw them refilling the water dispenser with a tub that didn't look so sanitary...made me lose my appetite.", 
      "\"A-ri-rang\" is the most popular and best-known Korean folk song. A-ri-rang is an ancient native Korean word with no modern meaning. 'Ari' means \"beautiful\"; 'Rang' can mean \"dear\".The food here is good, but there is nothing beautiful about the joint and the proprietor is anything but dear.I have been coming here for years and he has never smiled or said \"thank you\". \u00a0Today I ordered bi bim bap and instead of coming in a hot stone bowl as usual, it came in a cold plastic bowl. \u00a0At the very least, I wish he would have asked me to clarify my order.There are communal tables in the center of the place, which I like but they are merely worn out old folding conference tables.He always has the TV blaring on Headline News.But the food is good, maybe the best Korean on campus. \u00a0This is no small feat in a university town hosting 3500 native Koreans.So I added a star for good authentic Korean food, patronized by mostly Korean clientele, but subtracted a star for a surly owner and subtracted another star for crappy interior furnishings.", 
      "Best Korean food in Champaign. \u00a0I speak only the truth. \u00a0With an already generous serving of food, your meal also comes with two types of kim chi and soup.Plus, as meat-heavy as Korean food tends to be, A-Ri-Rang will accommodate vegetarian and/or vegan preferences.", 
      "Arirang is oh-kay.. when I have a craving for Korean, I would rather pay a little more and go to B-Won on Neil or Dorcas. \u00a0They are a little pricey for what you get. \u00a0Supposedly, a lot of Koreans go here because they have adjusted the menu and taken out the MSG.I think the dolsot bim bim bap is good here (rice in a hot stone bowl with veggies and meat). \u00a0I also think their bacon and spam with noodles is really good... forgot what that's called. \u00a0I don't think their rice cakes with spicy sauce is that good though.", 
      "I loved the beef bone soup I got to go from here and I found the crankiness of the owner to be charming. This is a low key campus joint so what do you expect?? Actually, the owner was fairly nice to me and smiled, probably because he figured I wasn't a student. It looked like most of the foreign students in there were also ordering soups (could have been because it was really chilly).The soup came with a large portion of rice and only 3 kimchees (not really banchan). Oddly enough, there were somen noodles in mine but the soup was deeply flavored and I was more than satisfied it. I can't wait to come back to IL to get another bowl of this soup, its my comfort food when I am on the road for recruiting.", 
      "The Korean food here is scrumptious, and from what my Korean friends tell me, it's super authentic. Judging by the high volume of Koreans eating there as well, this seems to be the consensus.The restaurant is a dive-y little joint and reminiscent of a beef stand, burger joint, or whatnot, but if you want fancy ambiance AND really good food, you should be prepared to pay extra for it. I can leave here with a full belly, a smile on my face, and be less than $10 lighter in the pocket.Concerning some of the other reviews, the owner has smiled and thanked me every time that I've ordered/paid or returned my dishes.During lunch, this place can get quite busy, so you might have to share a table with strangers and/or wait up to 20 minutes for your food, but it's totally worth it.", 
      "I had the spicy pork bulgogi and I felt it was pretty good for the price. The serving size was relatively large. However I don't think it is nearly as good as it's competitor Woorijib. Woorijib offers a pretty unique dipping sauce which this place doesn't have, but Woorijib is slightly pricier and charges you for extra rice.", 
      "The boss trying to sell me something they want to sell, which sucks. And the food is very low quality in all the Korean restaurant. I have had. Donot come here in Uiuc!!!", 
      "This is my Korean staple on campus. I always get the budae jjigae. Be warned, it is HUGE. Come during finals, as it is only a hop, skip and a jump off from the Union. They make great kimchi as well, especially the potato variety. With a huge main dish, two side dishes and unlimited tea at less than $10, this place is a jjigae dream. Cafeteria style seating, but so worth the delicious food. Give it a try and fall in love with the spicy soups.", 
      "Judging by the percentage of Korean customers, it must be the most authentic Korean place in Champaign, and it's better Korean food than I expected to find in such a small town. \u00a0A-OK - three stars - seems about right. \u00a0The food was a little bland, but the flavors were generally right and cooked well. \u00a0The ingredients seemed lower-quality as compared to Korean places in larger cities, but still very edible. \u00a0If I had a jones for Korean food while in Champaign, I'd go here without hesitation. \u00a0If I just wanted some good food, I don't know that it would cross my mind while in Champaign, though.", 
      "I give it 5 stars because of what I get for the price. Every dish here is under $10 before tax and they come with a generous portion too. Every dish comes with at least 2 side dishes of kimchi..The quality of the food is as good as it gets for under $10.Try the Bulgogi dishes and the Budae Jigae. By far best Budae Jigae.Also try the Omu Rice. It's their version of omelet fried rice. Fried rice is wrapped in omelet egg.I'm an easy going customer so the owner being not too friendly is not a big deal to me. In fact, what do you expect at a no-waiter restaurant? You don't have to pay tips already.", 
      "Although they don't provide the best customer service (none of the k- restaurant do), I always come back for their great food. Authentic and affordable, plus no MSG!", 
      "I am not always a big fan of Arirang. Somehow I find that their food is kinda bland. But surprisingly there's lots of Koreans eating at this place. In fact, my Korean prefers this place over Dorcas, which I love to go. Oh well, I am not Korean. What do I know? =)", 
      "I'm a HUGE fan of the combination bulgogi plate. \u00a0Chicken, pork, beef...all on one plate. \u00a0I'm getting hungry for some right now. \u00a0Too bad I'm two hours away...*sigh*", 
      "The food's decent, but I've never been impressed by this place. \u00a0The only things I can say I definitely enjoy about this place is that 1. it's usually not too crowded, and 2. they have mool nang myun in the summertime. \u00a0Mmm", 
      "My favorite Korean restaurant on campus. \u00a0Their combination bulgogi plate with chicken, pork, and beef was great! \u00a0And I love their bi bim bap too! \u00a0They give you a lot of food, plus soup and 2 kinds of kim chi.",

      "It depends what dish you ordered. I personally recommend soup#18 budae-jigae. And the fried fish is also good. But it just takes a long time for your order if you dine in at the peak time.", 
      "Straight up best budaejigae on the planet.", 
      "Good Korean restaurant and close to engineering labs.", 
      "I don't know if they gave us the flavor-less version because we are not Korean. But we had soon doo boo and dwenjang chigae and they were so-so at best. I had to add salt, gochu powder and gochujeon to mine to give it a little flavor. The owner was irritated as promised in other yelp reviews. The dining area was cramped and uninviting. I will definitely find another Korean place to go to in the future.", 
      "Pretty fast. I've had their soup, fried rice, dumplings, rice sticks, and some Korean stir fry thing and they're all pretty good.", 
      "I love Korean food.", 
      "When we first walked into this place, we went to the front to order. Hmm..I see this is a trend with the korean restaurants in campus town. So first things first, they don't accept cash. My, we need to get with the times people. And I ask the girl at the front (who's spacing off) \"what's good here?\" She looks at me completely puzzled as if she's never been asked that question and shrugs looking at the specials saying \"here are the specials\". Um, okay.. So I order one of the specials, which is tofu soup and fish. I actually enjoy the salty fish and the kimchi is alright, not the greatest, and the tofu soup could be better. So yeah, the food is okay, not too bad. But yes, this place looks like a cafeteria and it was packed with college korean students..why? I don't know.. Maybe there aren't too many korean restaurants around here? I'm getting deja-vu from woori jib but the food was better here.",

      "I love the tofu burritos here and the bubble tea is pretty solid. The burritos include sweet and spicy tofu, cilantro (optional), rice, cheese, lettuce, and other veggies. Personally, I think the flavor combinations is great and the burrito is huge (so I always get two meals out of it). My friends and I have all had good experiences with the Korean-Mexican fusion dishes. I've heard mixed reviews of the other items including the bi-bim-bap, but I'm not an expert on Korean food, so I'm not factoring that into this review. I like the space and decorations in Spoon House. However, it is slightly pricier than other establishments on Green Street and I've had experiences where my food can take a bit longer than I would expect.", 
      "The food here is very good! Big bowl of seafood soup! The cashier lady had a very horrible attitude! Didn't smile didn't even want to answer our questions! She basically ruined the experience! To the Asian cashier lady....you need to cheer up or quit your job.", 
      "I find this place much better than the 3/5 rating it currently has. The food is good, and they usually have it ready pretty fast. Prices are good. Unlike a lot of places around campus, it's not very crowded here. That might be because a lot of people don't like it, but I come here quite often for lunch.", 
      "I came here for their bubble tea, and it was so expensive!!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 bucks for a tiny little cup!!!!!!!! WT----?!!! my dear friends, listen to me, do not waste your money on the bubble tea, it was not worth the money. Food-wise, i haven't tried too many dishes yet, but the burrito is pretty good (i like the rice, its sticky and fresh). The restaurant is pretty, and they sell cute Asian snacks in the front. Shrimp chips, candy bars, stuff like that. Nice touch!", 
      "don't know if it's authentic in Koreans' opinion. I was there ordered rice cake w/ fish cake and tastes good. The ambiance was good too, great lighting and space. will go there again if I have that crave for Korean food", 
      "I had the soondubu jjigae on a rainy afternoon just awhile ago. Saltiest broth I've EVER had at a Korean restaurant. I couldn't even drink the soup. All the seafood in my bowl was incredibly rubbery and difficult to swallow. The added sodium did not help. On top of all this, the soup had no weight and was really thin. I was basically drinking salt water.Hoping for a better experience next time.", 
      "I'm not from Illinois but I came to take a look around the campus with a friend. Being fans of everything Korean, we decided to stop by at the Spoon House. I tried their spicy seafood platter and loved it. It was well worth the price.I also got the Korean quesadilla/taco. Those tasted not so great and oddly sweet.", 
      "I walked by their poster advertising Taco Tuesday and Thursday, and being curious about Asian fusion food, I decided to buy some...on a Wednesday. I was kind of hoping the regular price was worth it, but I was disappointed. By no means did they taste bad, but they weren't great either. I was kind of irked by the sogginess. It was all mushy and the juices from the meat mixing with the sauce made eating the \"taco\" like eating a moist sponge. I got a bulgogi beef and bulgogi chicken taco, and I noticed this was the same issue for both tacos. The beef was okay, but didn't have much flavor besides being spicy. The chicken was a bit dry, but despite that, it tasted pretty good with a mix of sweet and spicy. I'm not a pro on Korean food, but I think K-Bowl and Arirang do it better along with better pricing/portions.", 
      "Not bad, but there are better options nearby. I like Arirang a little better, and Woori-Jib even more. There are better places a bit further away like K-bowl, which I highly recommend, and Star Karaoke which is in Savoy.I come here primarily for two dishes: Bibim nyang myun, and the crispy spicy chicken both of which are pretty good. Prices are a bit high, but they have introduced some cheaper dishes recently. The major complaint I have is with the fruit flies. Winter, summer...whenever, they're always there flying around you. No other place on campus has this problem. I counted 5 of them on the wall right next to me the last time I ate here, and usually I have to swat them away several times while I eat. Not a major problem for some, but it's an issue for me.", 
      "Spoon House is a great place for lunch. I love the Mex-Asian fusion bugolgi burritos as well as the the traditional options on the menu. The food isn't the best Korean food I've eaten, but it sure hits the spot when I'm craving some bi bim bop. If you have never tried Korean food, Spoon House it's a great place to start. The menu is full of popular Korean dishes, and if you're not feeling adventurous, the burritos and tacos are a great alternative.", 
      "I went to Spoon House three times this past semester, and the thing that brings me back every time is their Korean tacos. I had Korean tacos for the first time a year ago, in LA, the home of Korean-Mexican fusion. Despite being two thousand miles away, Spoon House's tacos are definitely good enough to compete with those on the west coast. To know my knowledge, they're the only restaurant in town that serves such a dish; they're both delicious and reasonably-priced, which adds to their good reputation. Go for the beef bulgogi taco and the spicy chicken taco, those are the two best. Personally, I feel that they are too heavy to be eaten exclusively as a meal, so you're best off ordering a small rice or noodle dish with several tacos on the side, so it's easier on the stomach. I would avoid the quesadillas, the saltiness overwhelmed the taste of the meat. I can't really speak for the rest of the menu, but those tacos are quite a gem.", 
      "I was hoping to be the first to review but oh well :)Spoon House Korean Kitchen just opened on Green Street this week. I was pretty excited to go sometime this week. From the name of the place, Spoon House, I was hoping to sit in front of a hot bowl of traditional Korean soup on a nice cold night but the name was a little deceiving. The place was very bright and well-lit. The menu was lit on flat screen TVs which was a pretty cool feature in the restaurant. The menu consist of Korean-style tacos/burritos, Spoon House trays (Korean-style meat entree), and rice and noodle dishes, however, the menu was limited and a little random? One of the random dish was a ramen and kimbap combo (korean-style sushi) \u00a0which seems like a genius idea since this place is located on a college campus. I mean, what college kid wouldn't like that? My boyfriend and I (yes, I mention him every time I yelp... we like to eat a lot) shared a 3 taco combo special which include a fountain drink for $6.95 and Bulgogi tray. We also got an extra taco (each taco cost $2.00) to divide the food equally. The wait for the food was a little long since it wasn't busy which I can see as an issue during busy hours, but I didn't mind the wait. More importantly, let me talk about my meal....The tacos were nothing special. If you get the 3 taco combo special, it's nice that you can mix your pick of types of taco meat (bulgogi beef, bulgogi chicken, sweet and spicy chicken, or spicy pork). In my opinion I thought the tacos were eh okay. On a good note, the tacos felt light. I didn't feel like I want to roll home like I do when I eat Chipotle's burrito. The Bulgogi tray was pretty disappointing... maybe because of my Korean background, and growing up with awesome Korean mom/cook, I judge Korean meals critically. The bulgogi tray came with rice, side salad, 2 puny potstickers, an eggroll, and sweet potato fries. Suggestion... if you claim you're a Korean restaurant, why wouldn't you add kimchi in the tray? Kimchi is ubiquitous dish for Koreans. It's kinda of an insult to not have Kimchi at a Korean restaurant. Overall, the experience (food, service, atmosphere) wasn't terrible but \u00a0it was mediocre. It seems like Spoon House has catered their menu towards Western's taste. The food seems healthy and fresh, which you don't really get from other restaurants on Green Street. I wouldn't mind going to there again, but I might have to try something else on the menu. I wish their business good luck.", 
      "I am updating my review by dropping from 4 stars to 2 stars after my second meal at Spoonhouse. This time I had the Bi Bim Bap in hot stone bowl. \u00a0I am forced to compare it to the same dish served at Ai-Ri-Rang or B-Won, both of which are much better. \u00a0At Spoonhouse the proportion of white rice was much higher, with less meat and veggies. \u00a0The stone bowl was not as hot and therefore the rice didn't scorch the way it should, and the final insult was that the Srirachi sauce was served in squirters labeled: \"Bi Bim Bap sauce--hot\". \u00a0It would be as if McDonald's labeled their ketchup: \"hamburger sauce\", assuming the customers had no idea what the food was like or how to use the sauce.Lastly, the reference to burritos, tacos and quesadillas is offensive. \u00a0It's Korean food. \u00a0It doesn't need Mexican names to be understood.", 
      "Their ramen was made from the instant noodle packets that can be purchases at your local grocery market! I had a chicken dish which came with rice, noodles, and a salad, but their chicken was overcooked an extremely dry. Stay away!",

Too much rice in the burrito. not made so that each bite has a bit of everything, as i'd like.i had the pork beef burrito. it was alright. if you like cilantro, you'll enjoy it a little more.complimentary water cups!1 star for decor/design1 star for all you can eat kimchee.", 
      "I was told the Jja Jang Myun was good.It was not.The instant ones they sell in the Asian supermarkets taste infinitely better.I need to try other dishes, but I'm scared to try after that bad dish. So 2 stars works for me until friends drag me back.", 
      "Get there Korean tacos. The sweet and Spicy chicken tacos are fantastic. I usually get a couple different flavors. Get 2 if you aren't that hungry. 3 if you are.I've gone back several times and even taken some friends. They all enjoyed it quite a bit. Definitely give this place a try if your looking for something fun and new.", 
      "If you want pure Korean food, this place has it, but you are better off going to any of the regular Korean restaurants in town. \u00a0I'm still giving it a few stars because it is somewhat of a novel concept, which I support. \u00a0I'd hate to lose the only Korean burrito place we have. \u00a0I'll probably be back occasionally, but it's not going to be a regular stop.", 
      "I just had my first visit to Spoon House and I really enjoyed my experience. The owner came out from behind the counter and explained everything very well. I asked for his recommendation on what to order as it was my first time. I had the Beef Bulgogi quesadilla and I thought it was very tasty. I mentioned to the owner that I like spicy food and he brought me out a piece of the spicy pork quesadilla on the house which was also very tasty.One reviewer mentioned they didn't have Kimchi but when I was there they had little styrofoam containers with Kimchi sitting to the right on the counter for free. I had some and also thought this was tasty as well.It's super clean and very nice on the inside. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu and will recommend it to other people.", 
      "In response to Thomas B. :The typical sauce used in bibimbap is not Sriracha. Its main ingredient is kochujang, which is a red pepper paste that is prevalent in Korean cooking. Many Korean cooks have their own personal recipes for making that particular sauce. My mother uses sesame oil, sprite, fresh garlic, and other ingredients.Also, I believe Spoon House is following the trend on the West coast of putting Korean-style prepared meats into typically Mexican fare, such as burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. As such, the name bulgogi burrito is not offensive. My personal experiences at Spoon House have not been that great. Ddukbokki is one of my favorites, and I was slightly disappointed by their version. The dish had less heat and more sweetness than I cared for. I also did not care for their yukgaejang. The kimchi that was available on my first visit was watered down and bland, but was improved on my second visit. The bulgogi quesadilla, however, was pretty tasty, and I enjoy their bright colorful interior. Overall, I would go elsewhere for Korean cuisine, but would come back for Spoon House's burritos and quesadillas.", 
      "no. no. no. no. I don't review often, and really, I'm only writing this now as a reminder to never go to this place, ever again. My table ordered the kimchi quesadilla, chicken quesadilla, fried tofu tacos, and the Gangnam style fries, because it all seemed so novel (naively). What a mistake.The quesadillas were soggy with orange grease. The cheese on all the dishes was stiff and re-solidifying within five minutes. Their kimchi tasted like canned cabbage with no flavor, but perhaps it's because they \"caramelize\" (flash fried in grease?) it. My stomach was NOT happy the next day.I think the price was worth it, considering I purchased both a dish and the resolution to never eat here ever again. The fried tofu tacos was the only dish that looked somewhat fresh. Perhaps the straight Korean dishes are better (it's what most of the other patrons were ordering), but I'm not willing to find out. For now, I'll stick with A-Ri-Rang.", 
      "I love their food. My favorite are their burritos because they make the tortilla crispy. The flavors are Korean flavors so it is not your typical burrito. It is quite a unique food experience.", 
      "Great tofu tacos and bi bin bop and that's saying a lot for this town. Good atmosphere and consistent food. Great place to grab lunch or dinner! My son loves the tacos too and he's usually a picky eater.", 
      "Only been here once so far, but the food was great and the portions were large. \u00a0Got the Stonebowl Bi-Bim-Bop, which came with miso soup, and was stuffed to the brim when I left. \u00a0The sauce that was out for the Bi-Bim-Bop was supposedly spicy, but I dumped a ton on \u00a0my dish and barely felt the heat, though it was flavorful. \u00a0You can get their varieties of meats (and now tofu) as a \"bowl\" with rice, or as a \"tray\" with rice, noodles, and a salad. \u00a0My friend got the tray, and that thing was huge! \u00a0The burrito that somebody else got was so-so for the price, but was still tasty. \u00a0There is radish kimchi for free at the counter...I wasn't a fan...and they have to-go boxes out for the taking, as the \"trays\" could easily serve as two meals. \u00a0I can't wait to go again!", 
      "I tried their beef burrito and it deserves 3.5 stars.", 
      "We've been going here for a few weeks now and have been absolutely devouring the tofu tacos, bi-bim-bop, and the tofu quesadilla. This place has a nice atmosphere, quick service, seems clean, and the food is yummy in every way. If you're seeking good veggie chow in C-U and don't always want to have lunch in the basement of a church, this could be the place for you.", 
      "I had the tofu burrito. \u00a0It was ok, not too greasy, maybe a little cheese heavy. \u00a0Very nice crispy tortilla though, not a soft doughy mess like you get at say, Chipotle. \u00a0Actual effort went into presentation, which was a bit of a surprise, and the service was pleasant enough. \u00a0Flavor wise, the ingredients were fresh and well prepared, but the burrito itself was sweet to a fault. \u00a0The atmosphere is pretty surreal though. \u00a0A strange mix of Motown, Coldplay, and some indie rock are piped through the speakers. \u00a0Phrases like \"Dream, until your dreams come true\" are painted on the walls. \u00a0Large, shiny spoons are hung from the walls. \u00a0For Korean, you're probably better off at A-ri-rang. \u00a0That being said I've definitely had worse, and the place itself is kind of a trip.", 
      "I have not ventured out past the burritos and tacos, but both are great. \u00a0The food is cooked to order, but in my opinion worth the wait. \u00a0I usually go with the beef bulgogi burrito. \u00a0Great flavors and very filling.", 
      "I enjoyed their Korean burritos!", 
      "I went here for lunch on 3/29/2013 with 4 of my friends. Turns out that all 5 of us have food poisoning now, so I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone (especially considering how mediocre the food is).", 
      "Was once one of the best quick lunch spots on Green street. The location is good and prices were reasonable, but in recent times, the prices have gone up and I do not think that the new prices are justified for the food that is served. Quality of food seems about the same as before as is quantity, but price has increase by a couple of dollars, making it no longer a quick, cheap meal.", 
      "My three friends, my boyfriend and I ate at Spoon House on Friday at about noon (3/19). The food was mediocre, the ambiance was good, and I left feeling pretty satisfied. The satisfaction wore off, and the nightmare began, like so many B-grade horror movies. Fast forward to Saturday night. My stomach feels like it's being stabbed by a thousand treacherous knives, and my boyfriend is not doing much better. We're getting chills, we're achy, and we can't do much beyond lay on our backs and bemoan our pathetic existence.Around 10:30, calamity hit. Our apartment bathroom devolved into a Lord of the Flies scenario, with both of us fighting past each other to find something, anything, to throw up into. Vomit the consistency of wet granola spewed out of each of us like buckshot. I will spare you the details of our other bodily functions, but let's just say that by dawn, our bathroom resembled a Pollock. My boyfriend only vomited once. One of the unfortunate souls we dined with threw up over twelve times All of us were too weak to do much beyond lay on our respective bathroom floors, undergo unspeakably painful stomach cramps, vomit, and pray for an Easter miracle. Spoon House, all of Neptune's great ocean will not wash this blood from your hands. We're graduate students. We all have deadlines and conferences coming up, and having to sleep in a bathtub because I just can't stop throwing up is not the best use of my time. The fact that all five of us had different dishes just underscores the fact that you guys need to start following health code before you get shut down. As per my scorched earth policy, I will never go back and I will warn all of my friends about your culinary betrayals. Get it together.", 
      "I moved out of town recently and, on a return trip, got spoon house. it was so effing good and I'm reviewing it primarily to boost its yelp rating. it very much deserves a rating higher than 3-stars. I tend to get the tofu tacos, which are totally super good. fun fusion!", 
      "Gosh...I tried it once, ordered the ramen thinking it was going to be actual ramen. Instead I got Shin ramen (Korean ramen that comes in packages), with some onions in it...I was so upset. It came with this Korean sushi that was basically rice, radish, and bologna. That cost 8 dollars. The bag ramen is worth 1 dollar. My friend tried the bulgogi tacos and they were not good. They were greasy and not very delicious. I do not recommend at all.", 
      "I don't know why my review was filtered. I was merely truthful. I will try to be nice now: this was one of the truly worst food experiences I've ever been through. In our generous (and food-wise varied) Urbana-Champaign, I can only think of Great Impasta (POST-change of place/owner) that offered food as bad as this one. The amount of salt (and/or MSG) used makes the food to border on inedible. A bad sign was that there wasn't one Korean person inside, only Caucasians. I should have known better.", 
      "Probably the most unsatisfying Korean meal I ever had. Save yourself the trouble and goto A-Ri-Rang", 
      "Spoonhouse is a regular spot for a lunch with my coworkers. \u00a0I won't speak to the authenticity of the food as I am not a Korean food expert, but it is always very tasty! \u00a0 I usually stick with the traditional beef bulgogi, but my coworkers have enjoyed the tacos as well. \u00a0Even when it's extremely busy (almost always) they get the food out to you fairly quickly. \u00a0My only complaint is that it is a little pricey at around $8 for a dish. \u00a0Give it a try!"

      "Great pizza. I love the specialty ones...especially their bbq chicken one. It is seriously delicious. It is also pretty cheap considering the quality and portion size; never paid over four bucks. Open late so really good option on for those post-green street bar night but beware it WILL get crowded around that time. Clean. Fantastic music as well. Love me some Antonios.", 
      "What's really good about this place is that it's open late. The pizza slices are fairly large but they're meh. Essentially, the slices are pre-made and then warmed. Even though they put my pizza through their warmer, it was still cold. The whole pizzas come in two sizes: medium (12\") and large (16\"). Medium pizzas cost anywhere from $10 to $11.75. Large pizzas cost anywhere from $14.25 to $17.50.", 
      "The pizza is overpriced and under filling. I ordered two sausage slices which tasted like they had been sitting in the trash for days to be reheated. I can't see this place being appetizing to anyone unless they're at least 6 shots deep with a couple of benzos on board.", 
      "Used to come here when I visited for holidays, holidays meaning Halloween, and unofficial (st pattys) during my college years! The place would be packed you would have to make ur way across the ocean of paper plates. This spot is not just drunk food, its genuinely good! What makes this place stand out is their lage selection of pizzas with all sorts of toppings. Wish there were more places like this!", 
      "Just like the rest of life, it's best when you're drunk and so out of it you just don't care anymore or forget who you are and why you exist. Worst part is sometimes eating sobers you up.", 
      "Enjoyable! I love how creative this pizza joint is. They do a great job on both traditional and innovative pizza toppings. I recommend anything with spinach and feta, though they do wonders with a bit of avocado and salsa. Be adventurous and try something, everything is delicious.", 
      "ANTONIO'S is back!!!I loved getting pizza here after a night of fun on Green St. and the bars. Antonio's is the place to go for a delicious quick slice of New York-styled pizza and the price is good. There's a lot of variety in the choices of toppings/slices.I'm a fan of the staff working there too.", 
      "I've been meaning to review this place for ages--I have no bad things to say about Antonio's pizza. I've been a stranded New England native, fond of Boston and New York style pies, and for three long years, I was deprived, forced to eat those soups-in-bread-bowls called deep dish pizzas. Antonio's answers this with some DELICIOUS, well-priced thin crust pizza. The toppings are creative, the diameters huge, and the cheese a perfect, supple mozzarella. The staff is so friendly and the food so worth it that you'd be a fool to skip Antonio's.", 
      "Let's be honest, graduate school is hard and often horrible. \u00a0There are times when you are reading nine hundred pages, writing a ridiculous paper or four, and teaching classes. \u00a0Sometimes life becomes simply unbearable. \u00a0This is why there is Antonio's. \u00a0Antonio's is a tiny space of joy in a world that can be excessively painful. \u00a0I imagine it as an island of tranquility, if that tranquility comes equipped with some of the most ridiculous pizza ideas ever and a host of smooth nineties slow jams. \u00a0And that is what I need every Monday afternoon, when Antonio's has a buy one slice get one free special. \u00a0So I pay about $3 for two huge slices of pizza and a half hour of belting out Toni Braxton, Babyface, maybe if I'm lucky a little Alicia Keys? \u00a0Hell yes.The slices themselves range from inspired to bizarre to terrifying, but they generally mange to pull of the crazy flavour combinations. \u00a0They have gyro, nachos, fresh mozzarella with pesto, potato wedges and bacon, and any number of other combinations.So on a Monday afternoon, you can find me sitting over a double slice of heaven, singing \"You'll Always Be My Baby.\" \u00a0And I wouldn't have it any other way, Antonio's.", 
      "Antonio's is just one of the many pizza places in Champaign Urbana and they do a relatively good job. Antonio's sells thin New York style slices and whole pies if you want them and their menu is very expansive from tex-mex to chicken-pesto. They always have a something different everyday.For me, I usually stick to a slice of mushroom and a slice of Sicilian pizza. The Sicilian is a thick crust pizza with a sweet sauce, it's really delicious. The are vegetarian options galore from artichoke pizza to pasta pizza. The food overall is definitely food on the go I'd say catering to the student lunch and drunk 1am crowd. Antonio's would definitely hit the spot to satisfy that hunger while you're drunk. Prepare for some clogged arteries because their pizza is pretty greasy, but I don't complain. The flavors aren't complex, but we're talking pizza here folks. \u00a02 slices of pizza will probably run you from $4 to $6 so you definitely get full.Note: Their water is free, but the temperature in the sports looking water cooler is usually tepid. Pop is $1 and refills are 50 cents.I've never ordered delivery, but I image that would be a nightmare (I've only seen one Antonio's car in their lot) so stick to dine in or carry out.Looking for cheap, greasy, satisfying food? Look no further than Antonio's.", 
      "I love the creative pizza options this place comes up with! \u00a0One time I had a chicken burrito pizza. \u00a0Sounds terrifying, right? \u00a0Somehow, it was magical. \u00a0I'm a little underwhelmed by their \"regular\" pizza toppings, though. \u00a0The whole point is to try something inventive, so take chances! \u00a0Also, I wish the slices weren't sitting under a heat lamp for hours, but that's pizza-by-the-slice for you. \u00a0Oh well, it still tastes good.", 
      "I tried Antonio's when it first opened back up, and it was AMAZING! Pizza was hot, fresh, and so good! Pepperoni and Sausage are staples, but they also have daily specials, which are hit or miss. Sadly, over time, the place seems to have gotten weaker. The pizza just doesn't seem to taste the same, as if every slice I've gotten for a while has been made for at least a few hours. :(If you want to drink water, there is a table by the register with a dispenser (like the kind you would see at a football game) and small plastic cups.Staff there has always been super friendly and nice, probably their strong suit.", 
      "I really like this style of pizza, they don't do the best job in the world but it's hard to complain. \u00a0They always have a big selection of classic/veg/weird toppings on the slices to pick from and the crust is way way better than any of the standard cardboard chain stuff you might find down the street. \u00a0I wish I knew when the slices were freshest, like a krispy kreme hot light or something. \u00a0Either way it's still an extremely cheap, pretty yummy Green St option. \u00a0It's not really the kind of place people stay for more than 15 min and I sometimes wonder if part of it is that they always have a really cheesy 80's/pop station playing loudly in the background.", 
      "This is probably my favorite pizza place on campus. The toppings are always unique and you have about a bazillion to choose from, the slices are huge, and the price is good. I never get the same toppings twice, and I've never had a bad experience. Usually I go here after a night out, but it's not your typical disgusting-unless-you're-drunk food. You can happily eat Antonio's at any time of the day. The staff are saints for dealing with the belligerent drunks that yell slurred pizza flavors at them, and the jug of water at the front is exactly appropriate. I absolutely believe that their pizza and numerous glasses of water has saved me from hangovers.I have no idea what people are talking about regarding decor or water presentation. Have you been to a pizza place before? Antonio's is fantastic, end of story.", 
      "I got really really sick from eating one of these pizzas my pizza was reheated and was clearly left there over night. Will never eat here again there is a specific reason this place got closed down and now is reopened. You also can't see it's health permit anywhere!!", 
      "Glad this place is back. It's not QUITE as tasty as I remember, but still has an awesome spread of unique flavors. I will still stop in from time to time.", 
      "If Antonio's delivered, they would probably rule the world by now. Let me mention that I'm not reviewing this through a post-bar drunken point of view - I don't drink, and all my drunk buddies and sober me are drawn to this place like it has a tractor beam, as soon as 2am rolls around. We talk about how we can't wait to go to Antonio's in the afternoon before we get ready, as we're walking to the bars, and while we're at the bars.I recommend the barbecue steak and bacon, although the steak has been tough for me once. There's also a steak and bacon ranch, subbing ranch for BBQ, obviously. Buffalo chicken bleu is spectacular, with lots of blue cheese and good vinegar hot sauce. The tortellini is good, but I've had the shells be undercooked before, and if they have the gyro pizza, you should not miss it. SOOOOO good. And it's $3 a slice for a massive slice. At 2am, I'm usually pretty hungry, but even then two slices is a lot for me. This never stops me from getting two, though.OK - it's not ultra gourmet, wood oven pizza. and yes, it's kinda greasy. But guess what. It's in freaking Champaign, IL - not even the cultural flower of the C-U area. And I don't eat pizza as a health food.Fight the post bar crowd, and do it. Or, even better, go every day for lunch, and accelerate their inevitable domination of this planet.", 
      "Every year, I take as many T.I.S. coupon books as I can, tear out all of the Antonio's buy on get one free's, and stash them in my room. Haha, sorry roomie! It's just THAT good. Quick service, free delivery, hilaaarious staff. Don't leave campus without stopping into Antonio's.", 
      "Sigh why does everyone like Antonio's so much? \u00a0Thin crust = yuck. \u00a0Toppings = all oil. \u00a0Ingredient freshness = questionable. \u00a0Price = (2)*(As expensive as it should be considering the previously implied high oil:crust thickness ratio). \u00a0Maybe I just enjoy getting sleazed on by the pizza slicers less than the average Antonio's patron?The only redeeming quality of this place is the outlandish variety of toppings: \u00a0tortellini, tortilla chips, blue cheese, steak, bacon, you name it, they will cover it in oil and leer at you while they slice it up for you.", 
      "I haven't been here since I graduated a couple of years ago, but I was around when it opened and ate there almost every week until I left UIUC. Super fast and super cheap is the name of Antonio's game. Not to mention the very interesting pizzas you can try by the slice. Make no mistake, this place is NOT fancy (e.g. patrons can get water out of a big orange cooler). But it doesn't need to be. Antonio's is great for a quick lunch/dinner and it is really, really great for as post-bar food stop.The bottom line here is: If you are interested in weird shit on your pizza, if you want a quick meal with zero frills or if you are more than a little tipsy, check this place out.", 
      "Look, I don't live here, and I know nothing about Antonio's Pizza. \u00a0I was interested in learning about their pizza, and so I ordered some. \u00a0Thing is, it never arrived. \u00a0About an hour after ordering, we called. \u00a0We were assured it was running behind and the driver had left 40 min ago. \u00a0Well, at this point we were looking forward to the prospect of 40 minute old pizza, but, not to worry, it never showed up. \u00a0We tried calling several times afterwards and no one answered.I sincerely hope everyone at Antonio's is well, and that some tragic incident didn't interrupt our pizza, but never before has pizza just not showed up. \u00a0At least the courtesy of a phone call, you ask? \u00a0Nothing.", 
      "This place is really awesome! Super creative slices of pizza and for a good price, too. I got a HUGE piece of tortellini pizza and a large soda for $4.70. The guys who work there were joking around with me and super nice the whole time. Every college campus should have a place like this!", 
      "Antonio's is a good deal. \u00a0I don't go here too often for lunch or dinner because I try to be more healthy with my food options. \u00a0For me.. it's not quite enough for me to eat one slice.. but two slices is too much. \u00a0But definetely a great place to go when you're hungry and been out drinking all night. \u00a0Great drunk food.. that's affordable. \u00a0But the place is packed then.The Beef Taco pizza is delicious.. and so is their potato bacon pizza. \u00a0Not crazy about the lack of decor... or the fact that their water comes from a plastic water tank.", 
      "I like their florentine pizzas. It's a nice place to grab lunch since they sell by the slice.", 
      "They have a variety of slices and a frequent slice card! \u00a0Buy 11 slices and the 12th one is on them. \u00a0And you could eat for under $5 (slice and a coke)KYLE rocks! He is super friendly, and is always willing to tell you what is on the slices or what he recommends! Arturo is friendly too!P.S.Grew up with NY slices soI think Papa Del's is overrated, and the wait there is ridiculous..", 
      "One of my favorite places to go in Chambana land. Big New York style pizza slices and man do they have options. They have so many different kinds of pizzas with combinations you would never even think of - from putting pasta tortellini on there, Mexican pizzas with actual tortilla chips, baked potatoes, and they all taste awesome! My all time favorite though is the Chicken Bacon Ranch SICILIAN slices, I could seriously have that be the only thing I eat for the rest of my life. Great place to come for the drunken munchies after the bars or at any other time of the day. Be warned though, if you go after the bars close or near that time you will be standing around for quite a while...but so worth it!", 
      "Best pizza in CU.White pizza is excellent. They do have odd closings at times.", 
      "Loved it. \u00a0Very inexpensive pizza. \u00a0$14 for two Large pizzas (16 inch!) \u00a0Was fast and a very excellent tasting East coast pizza. \u00a0(New York Style). \u00a0Would definitely go here again. \u00a0Not sure how eating in is, but the inside is really small and it seems they only offer slices of a few types of pizza. \u00a0Only downside was that one of our pizzas was barely cooked. \u00a0We threw it in the oven for a few minutes though once we got home and it was as good as ever. \u00a0All and all, really delicious pizza for very cheap prices!", 
      "Can't believe the lame reviews this place is getting -- It's one of the best slices of pizza you can get, hands down. I am so excited it's OPEN again!You want black bean avocado pizza (rare, but my favorite)? Steak & bacon? Chicken pesto tortellini? The slices are always creative but delicious, so be brave! It's what sets this place apart, and it's probably tastier than you would imagine! The hardest thing about going to Antonio's is choosing which slice to get. Note these are thin crust style, so if you're looking for that bread-filled deep dish monstrosity that some people call pizza, this is not it.Hits the spot when you just got out of Murphys at 2am. Personally, I like to stop by at lunch. The slices are gigantic so you get a lot of bang for your buck.", 
      "Love Antonio's! It's the perfect late night craving spot. The tortellini pizza is yum-o! The staff is super fun, the music is always loud, and the staff are singing/dancing away, totally enjoying themselves. It's the most crowded around 2, when the bars close, but the wait is never more than a few minutes. I've never eaten it before 1 am, but it's a great after bar place. And cheap too!", 
      "Great New York style pizza with the craziest toppings you've ever seen! This place always hits the spot, whether it's for lunch or at 2am after a night out. By the way, check out the TIS coupon books for the buy one get one free coupons! Hopefully they haven't stopped doing that.", 
      "Now if you had told me before Antonio's opened that there was going to be a pizza by the slice place on Green Street, I know I would have said \"you know it is going to be garbage that only the drunk kids coming out of the bars will eat.\" I was so happy that Antonio's proved me flat out wrong. They make some of the best gourmet pizzas that I have ever had with topping combinations that I would never have thought of. Potato on a pizza!? Hell yeah! Antonio's rules, and for the price, I don't think you can find a better deal close to campus.", 
      "It's amazing how much variety Antonio's has in their pizza. \u00a0I usually get a slice of avocado enchilada and a slice of buffalo chicken. \u00a0The people working are generally quite nice, and the food is cheap and delicious. \u00a0Once they didn't have any avocado enchilada, so they made it for me on a slice of cheese-- they were so accommodating, it was wonderful.", 
      "Pretty good pizza, really great prices. \u00a0A very filling meal for two is under $10. \u00a0The pizza is best if you go when it's crazy busy so that your slices are fresh. \u00a0A visit on a slow evening during the summer will net you luke warm slices (even after their trip through the little oven), which are not quite as good but still better than most of the other pizza places on campus and still a great bargain.", 
      "RATINGS CHANGE?!?!?I may have to change the rating for this place. \u00a0I think that their loyal customers deserve more than a sign on the door saying \"Closed Today\" for the last month and a half. \u00a0Do they plan to ever reopen? \u00a0Anyway, the rating below reflects when they were in business. \u00a0I'd give them only one star now for the way they've handled whatever is going on. \u00a0-------------------------WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PIZZA PLACE??? \u00a0I went there to get my daily fix and they were closed for cleaning. \u00a0That was May 9th and they still haven't reopened. \u00a0Anyone know what's going on??? \u00a0I NEED MY PIZZA!!!-------------------------Pizza by the slice. \u00a0That alone rates raves. \u00a0Good pizza by the slice. \u00a0Now that's awesome. \u00a0Good, very-much-like-Brooklyn pizza by the slice. \u00a0Can't top that. \u00a0 I stick to the traditional Italian toppings. \u00a0 Antonio's comes very close to the Brooklyn pizza I grew up with and I like stopping by for a slice or two or three. \u00a0Staff is very friendly, too. \u00a0Fun guys who seem to enjoy their work. \u00a0My only complaint is its location and the lack of parking. \u00a0I work nearby, so it's not a problem during the week, but over the weekend, when I'd really like some slices, it's not very convenient. \u00a0Open another in Urbana!!! \u00a0Maybe the Godfather can make them an offer they can't refuse.", 
      "The mexican/avocado pizza is to die for. \u00a0You must try it now! \u00a0If not that, they have tons of variety to suit any kind of taste.", 
      "If you're at the U of I and want a slice of pizza, go here. If you've been drinking, it only makes it better. The line always looks huge at night but they serve everyone really fast. Every now and then the cashier will give a free drink to someone for no real reason at all. Everyone can find a reason to love Antonio's. All in all, Antonio's is amazing- if you're on green street, this is the place to go.", 
      "I applaud their creativity with the slices. \u00a0I was excited to see a place like this open on Green street, but damn, can you heat your slices?! \u00a0They sit there for hours and then they throw it a lukewarm oven for 30 seconds. \u00a0I'll eat cold pizza, but I'm not paying $2.50-$3 a slice for it!", 
      "Hands down, the absolute BEST pizza in Champaign And coming from me that says a lot! I am EXTREMELY picky about my pizza and as far as I'm concerned pizza sucks outside of New York and I really don't eat it in other states because it is so far from what pizza is supposed to be, most of the time. But this place is one of the few exceptions I'll make. So many places call themselves New York pizza and claim to be New York pizza, and many of them succeed fooling the tourists or locals who don't know any better. In fact there is a pizza place 2 doors down from here that sucks so bad, but it's always packed with drunk idiots. Granted, this place is tiny and there may be a wait, but it is so worth it. REAL New York pizza in a pizza parlor with New York attitude, the way it's supposed to be! And for pete's sake, by the slice the way it's supposed to be! When you want a quick lunch, who wants to wait around for a whole pizza to be cooked at \"personal\" small size which means more dry lousy crust and less good middle pizza? Everyone in NY learned that a century ago and somehow the rest of the country hasn't caught up? I love that the kids working there blast metal music and just don't care because they know they've got the best pizza and people will come regardless. Arinell's: Keep on keepin' on! I Love You. Don't ever close!", 
      "Went there for the first time today, as this was a place that I had heard older students rave about, and it finally reopened. \u00a0It's decent by-the-slice New York-style pizza. \u00a0I think Antonios' hook is that they have an incredibly creative selection of toppings, rather than the pizza being out-of-this-world based on its crust, or cheese, or some other particular item. \u00a0That said, the prices were quite reasonable, and the food was good. \u00a0I'll definitely be going back there in the future."

The meat isn't dried up and charred like I've hat at so many other places - it's fresh, juicy, and flavorful. No bland, thin pita or cucumber sauce here. The only downside is that there aren't any Zorba's in LA, because now I'm addicted.", 
      "After my horrendous experience with Niro's I was optimistic that Zorba's might have a better gyro.The store is right on Green street and impossible to miss walking by. Inside is pretty cool, open style kitchen and lots of indoor seating. The menu is on the counter where you order, which could be problematic if you are like me and take 5 minutes to look at a menu and there are people behind you!I decided on a 4oz gyro and mac and cheese bites. My name was taken and I was called when it was ready. Interestingly enough, you also pay right when your food is ready, which was different, but I liked it!I dashed home and unwrapped everything, anxious to try it. My gyro was actually pretty small and almost resembled a taco in size and shape. I did think that this gyro was really on point though. The meat was thicker, flavorful, not too greasy and of a good consistency. The tzatziki was really good, too! Kind of creamy but not too yogurt-y or watered down like some places. The mac and cheese bites were also surprisingly good. Usually these are just dry pieces of mush but on the inside they were warm, gooey and tasty! Overall I would definitely say the Zorba's has the best gyro in the CU area, but I still need to try more places.The only thing I did not like was the portion/price. My gyro was not very big, I probably could have ate 2-3 of them. However, quality over quantity any day of the week and this was one tasty gyro that would really give my suburban favorites a run for their money.I'll be back to try more!", 
      "2.5 stars. I have a feeling that at some point in the 1970s this place was serving amazing family recipe homemade gyros and built some kind of mystique. Well, now it's clearly just Kronos fast food, and they misfire on all cylinders.The meat is barely roasted and heated through, it's supposed to be super charred. Cucumber sauce is just some yogurt. The pita isn't olive oil crispy, it's microwaved or something. You can get a sandwich like this anywhere in Chicago, prepared a lot better.Prices are good, portions are fine for the cost, flavor is substandard to most gyros I've had elsewhere. I'd still eat junk food here over Chipotle, which is fresher but a heartless corporation, but this place is a big disappointment considering the lore that comes with it. Find that old family recipe and get back to doing things the old fashioned way!", 
      "The salad doesn't have enough cheese!", 
      "Not a gyro expert but this was the most tender gyro I've ever had. Didn't know a gyro could achieve the melt in your mouth consistency. I usually am hungover when i eat gyros, but I was not hung over when I ate this. I almost want to binge drink so I can eat here the next day. Good stuff.", 
      "This is simply one of my favorite spots in town. They say that consistency is the hallmark of excellence. Well I've been stuffing my face with their delicious gyros and assorted fried side dishes since high school, and I've yet to eat one that wasn't just totally fulfilling and delicious. \u00a0Actually, the hallmark of excellence is probably just making really fantastic gyros, which is a thing that Zorba's is all about. The staff is always friendly, and even at their busiest you're going to get your order quickly.My go to order has generally been the large chicken, however you can't go wrong with the classic. You can take either and pick a size to fit your small-large appetite, and then customize it from there, which is a little different, and better, than most other gyro joints I've visited. I also prefer subbing in onion rings or fried mushrooms for fries.The location is a little small, so it can get packed during the lunch hour, but even so there is usually a table open, or you can easily get your meal to go.If you find yourself on campus and don't check this place out, you're doing yourself an enormous disservice.", 
      "Best Gyros in Illinois. Fast and delicious. A campus treasure. A Champaign treasure.The gyros are authentic and the santiki (?) sauce is second to none. \u00a0Greek salads are another highlight.", 
      "Yep, it lived up to the hype. Great gyro sandwiches with a cool local feel. The pita is soft and the gyro meat is some of the most tender I've found. Brilliantly seasoned too, the meat is definitely what sets these gyros apart. I also liked that there are multiple size options for the sandwiches. The place has a nice, local college hotspot feel. Not wild and crazy, but more the kind of place students stop by on their way to and from class.", 
      "The joint that launched my love affair with the gyro. Their tzatziki sauce is still my favorite, and the chili is delicious.", 
      "They sell their gyros in 4 sizes: 2 oz, 4 oz, 6 oz, and 8 oz. This is pretty neat as a large or medium gyro should be enough to suffice a hungry person. However, I have to say that their gyro meat isn't as succulent as I thought it'd be. The Greek salad wasn't anything special either. I gotta say that I prefer Niro's Gyros more.", 
      "Gyros are soooo tasty, I keep coming back for more. Price is okay and service is fast. Only complaint would be portion size for their salads...their small was much smaller than in most places, but it was yummy. Seriously try their gyros.", 
      "The best gyro's in town , I recommend it highly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", 
      "My favorite restaurant right around the university. Phenomenal gyros. I'd say I still hold Zorba's as the golden standard of gyros. I was there every Tuesday in college for Groovy Tuesday - $1 off gyros - and i was probably there at least one other meal each week. Quick, cheap, delicious. Can't get better than that.I have a gyro or two every time I'm back in Champaign. Everyone should eat more Zorba's!!", 
      "Came to Zorba's on the suggestion by a cousin who has, and I quote, \"never given a bad food recommendation\".And it was another hit! \u00a0Chicken gyros and fried mushrooms for dinner hit the spot. \u00a0At other Greek spots, I'm used to having a humongous foil wrapped hunk of a mess of gyro served to me that I inevitably finish... and end up feeling like a blob because I didn't want to waste food. \u00a0But Zorba's is here to help you with portion control! \u00a0I like how they offer their gyros in 4 different sizes. \u00a0Oh, and try the cucumber sauce. \u00a0You know you're in for a treat when it takes 9.8 seconds for the grease in your meal to seep through the bottom of the paper bag.", 
      "Great restaurant! Being that I was hanging out in Everitt for most of my stay in Chambana - I got very familiar with Zorba's!What to say about it... Service is always great. The people that work there always seem happy and treat you well. Prices are totally reasonable. I went almost every Tuesday as it was cheaper on Tuesday. Their gyros are great - though if you get a normal gyro you will be left smelling, well, like a gyro. The chicken gyro never had that effect for whatever reason. So good.I went almost every Tuesday and I'd get a large normal gyro with a side of fries. I'd bring a textbook and study for an hour or two while enjoying my amazing food. Great place to study ( at least for me) as there was always enough noise to keep my mind from wandering - but little enough noise so that I could concentrate.Never eat here before a test. You'll go into a food coma and not do well on your test. I learned this the hard way. The very, very hard way.", 
      "I am going to be the dissenting voice on this place, but I don't think it isn very good. \u00a0Everything it does, Niro's Gyros does both better and cheaper. \u00a0I honestly think Zorba's has kind of a privileged place due to nostalgia - it is an institution and one of the few places on Green Street that hasn't changed in the last decade (and beyond).So maybe I am not the target audience. \u00a0But the thing is, I love gyros! \u00a0They're greasy enough that I don't get them too often, but I do love them. \u00a0This brings us to the main problem: Zorba's gyros are not very good. \u00a0I have been used to the gyros in my hometown (gigantic), the ones in Naperville (huge), and the ones from Niro's (also huge). \u00a0The ones at Zorba's are comparatively small. \u00a0This is not a deal-breaker - I don't need the mountains of meat all the time. \u00a0The problem is that the meat is not very good. \u00a0It has kind of a gritty texture and an off flavor. \u00a0It reminds me of the frozen gyro meat you can get at grocery stores. \u00a0They offer an array of sauces, but the tzatziki is key and it's not very good either. \u00a0I see rave reviews of the fries, and while they are good, they aren't exceptional. \u00a0Even on a discount day, the fry and gyro meal is more than other places in town and I just did not like it as much. \u00a0I thought the first time might've been an unfair representation, but on the next visit I could not finish the gyro - the texture of the meat got to me. \u00a0Decor is old-fashioned as fits a local institution. \u00a0There is sort of a grease-haze that hangs in the air.", 
      "A Champaign Institution, great gyros, with even better service. \u00a0Definitely a can't miss when you are on Illinois' campus. \u00a0Check their daily specials before you go in some of them are great. \u00a0The fact that you can order a small, medium. or large gyro and customize it however you want make it good for any size appetite.", 
      "Hands down the most underrated place on campus. Everything they offer is at least good, while their gyros are nothing short of amazing (for Chambana, at least). The jazz shows are a nice touch, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff is always friendly. One of my favorite places to spend a break, whether it's between classes or during work.It doesn't offer enough food on the level of their gyros to warrant a five-star rating, but it deserves a strong four.", 
      "The gyros were pretty good, but their fries came with this amazing sauce.It was a delish combination of honey mustard but smelled and tasted like there was bacon in it. \u00a0I'm not sure what exactly it was but we couldn't stop dipping our fries in it - so good!", 
      "I love the gyros here.I love their cucumber sauce even more :)You can pick the size of gyro you want, so you can load up on as much as as little meat as you please.Service is good and there is plenty of room to eat right in the restaurant. \u00a0The only \"problem\" is that you'll smell like gyro, onion, and grease when you leave.", 
      "I usually eat healthy, well-balanced meals. \u00a0However, I occasionally indulge with something less health-friendly. \u00a0When I indulge, I go to Zorba's. \u00a0I order an enormous gyro with mountains of onion, tomato, cucumber sauce, and feta cheese. \u00a0A Zorba's gyro is heaven for the tastebuds. \u00a0Unfortunately, I usually get massive amounts of heartburn after eating at Zorba's, but it's totally worth it.I've been told that Zorba's has live music some nights, but I've never actually seen it.", 
      "I only went to Zorba's a couple times before it closed, and I remember being disappointed with it because I could get much better gyros back home. \u00a0I had given up on gyros on campus (until I went to niro's but that's another review) but I was willing to give Zorba's another chance when it reopened. \u00a0Many of my friends thought I was crazy for preferring niro's, so maybe I just remembered wrong?Well, it was pretty much the same as I remembered. \u00a0The meat is mediocre, and I feel like you definitely get more for your money at niro's. \u00a0I do like that they have different sizes so you don't have to get a giant gyro if you're not particularly hungry.Had I rated Zorba's before coming back, I would have given them four stars. \u00a0The food isn't bad; I've just had better. \u00a0But my favorite part of a gyro is the cucumber sauce, and it just wasn't right here. \u00a0Correct me if I'm mistaken, but isn't it supposed to be thick, white, and yogurty? \u00a0And nice and cold so you get that contrast between the cold sauce and the warm gyro meat? \u00a0Well, the sauce here was runny, warm, and almost clear. \u00a0I don't know, maybe something was just weird when I went, but with Niro's in my backyard (where I know they have the right sauce) and graduation in a month, I doubt I'll be back.", 
      "I think it says something that my friend has searched far and wide throughout all of Chicago and failed at finding another gyro place as good as Zorba's in Champaign.Throughout my 4.5 years in Chambana, never once did I have a less than spectacular meal here. Both their chicken and original (I believe it is a mix between beef and lamb) gyros are mouth-watering. I was afraid that the lamb would have that weird gamey taste, but it only made for a more complex flavor, which I totally didn't expect. They have a great selection of sauces that I am guilty of drowning my gyros in. Their fries are made to order and come out piping hot and are even more delectable with a dipping sauce concoction of my own (made by combining their honey mustard and cucumber sauces - must try). What I found surprising is that no one knew about their unlimited and FREE toppings list. You can get a whole assortment of other toppings on your gyro all at no charge!Two years ago, they started catering to the drunk, after-bars crowd on Fridays and Saturdays. However, those gyros are a fraction of the size and a fraction of the goodness of their regular ones. So I'd stick to One World to fulfill that drunken craving if I were you...*Also, I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but I always come out of the restaurant smelling like I've dipped myself in frying oil. I'm thinking that their made to order fries has something to do with it.", 
      "Welcome back Zorbas! Green Street didn't feel the same without you since you burned down.Zorba's new space is much more roomy with the cashier on the right and near the back, directly opposite from where it was located before. Although the ambiance is much improved, my gyro lacked taste. Sure it had all of the fixings without me asking: yogurt sauce, cucumber, tomato, onion...but the meat was bland.My expectations for food quality are high even though this restaurant is located in the midst of collegiate-drunken-food-ville where food in this area is generally bland.", 
      "This was my favorite place to get Gyros in town. Despite the heated debate over who had the best gyros (Zorba's vs. Niro's Gyros), I always sided with Zorba's, the 'fixins' added to the gyro (tomato, onions and whatever else you wanted) were always fresh and great quality, something that NIro's seemed to lack on more than one occasion.Zorba's had daily specials (like Groovy Tuesdays: one dollar off classic gyro meals) which kept me coming back every Tuesday I attended classes at the University of Illinois. However, on Wednesday March 23, 2011 Zorba's was affected by the fire that started in the apartments above the business. As of now, I don't know when, if ever they'll re-open their shop on Green St. But here's to hoping!", 
      "Ah Zorba's, makes me feel young again. \u00a0I frequented this place all the time when I was a student at UofI. \u00a0YUM their gyros are some of the best. \u00a0I like that they have different sizes of gyros. \u00a0Definitely get the fried mushrooms, you won't be disapointed. \u00a0Pass on the spinach pie though, it's not very good. \u00a0They aren't the cheapest if you're a poor student, it can add up if you get fries and mushrooms and everything. \u00a0Cheap beers. \u00a0They used to have free jazz on Tuesdays, I think, not sure if they still do.YUM their cucumber sauce is awesome. They also have a wonderful honey dijon for the chicken gyros. \u00a0My bf sometimes has to go down to UofI for career fairs, I always make him to go Zorbas and get me a gyro with extra cucumber sauce. \u00a0I will eat it 3 hours later and cold, and it's still delicious.They call out your name when your order is ready, my friends and I would give them funny names like Shaft and one time I was Captain, and my friend was Tennille, but they called Tennille first, that blew.", 
      "It's pretty good. Nothing too special; I normally get the grilled chicken sandwich, which has been dry a few too many times for my taste. It's also a bit expensive compared to some of the other Campustown locations, but a nice change of pace every once in a while. I'm never unhappy at Zorba's. I will say that I wish the place hadn't caught fire- the memorabilia collection they have is nice, and I would have loved to see the old one.", 
      "One of the regular spots on Green street, every time I make the painful decision not to eat at Antonio's and instead eat here, I'm a little surprised as how much I like Zorba's. I see a review saying Niro's is better and cheaper - Zorba's isn't that expensive - but I've never been to Niro's, so I can't compare. I will say that Zorba's has great fries - crinkle cut. Not much else to say - it's standard gyro stuff, for a pretty reasonable price (huge portion, fries and drink for like $7), and it's definitely one of the few places on that first block of Green that hasn't changes in I think 35+ years.", 
      "Currently closed due a fire above them. \u00a0:( \u00a0I always look forward to eating here and was so sad when I came home in May and couldn't have any. \u00a0I wish them a speedy recovery. \u00a0I'll be back for the holidays and hope they have re-opened by then.My parents used to come here when they were dating back in the day. \u00a0They started taking me and my brother as kids. \u00a0The whole family enjoy the food. \u00a0It's the only place my dad will eat fries. \u00a0I, on the other hand, love fries, and while their fries are good, they aren't THAT good. \u00a0 The gyros on the other hand are! \u00a0We get the lamb ones. \u00a0It's always a tough decision trying to figure out what size to get- sometimes your eyes are bigger than your stomach. \u00a0The food is consistent good and served quickly. \u00a0And I love the Illini memorabilia. \u00a0Hopefully, they will still have some to post when they re-open.Parking is an issue as they have no dedicated lot. \u00a0The best plan for when school is in session (if you don't live on campus) is to drop off someone, let the other person circle around to find parking, and take it with you. \u00a0Otherwise, be very patient with finding parking- especially during lunch time.", 
      "This place was delicious!My roommate and I came here on default because the other place we were trying to go to was already closed!But good thing the gyros & fries here were delicious and made-to-order! \u00a0And the gyro meat tasted super fresh! \u00a0I loved how you can get extra cucumber sauce and the \"hot sauce\" obviously was mixed with the cucumber sauce...all delicious!The establishment has been open for awhile and I can see why college students would come here after partying!", 
      "Zorba's is still my favorite gyro place of all time. \u00a0The food is delicious and they have some pretty unique sauces. \u00a0The meat is always tender and flavorful, never dry or bland. \u00a0Definitely check out the Groovy Tuesday deal = $1 off original gyros (lamb + beef mix) and half off fries. \u00a0The fries are the best I've ever had--crispy yet not too skinny, and always piping hot. \u00a0Check them out! \u00a0I always stop by for a bite when I'm back in town.", 
      "My friend introduced me to Zorba's, I love their special, it keeps me awake at night, drooling for it...Fries are good as well, overall great experience.", 
      "I was trying to think of places I would miss when I finish my Master's program here in Champaign-Urbana and the top three are Murphy's, Canopy Club and Zorba's. I've always been a fan of gyros and I have to say that these are right up there with the ones I get in Chicago. In fact, Zorba's is better than some of the gyros I've gotten in Chicago before. This is my favorite place to eat on Green Street. Besides Antonio's, it's probably the only one that not a chain and I unequivocally love the Large Gyro combo plain with a Cherry Pepsi.", 
      "Fine times i have had here the fries sometimes are subpar and thats why three stars because how can you mess up frozen fries but they manage to so maybe take a look at your product or prep, gyros taste great to me.", 
      "Cool place for lunch on campus... It's right next door to Za's, where I've going a bit too often, so I'm glad I finally gave it a try. They're specialty is gyros sandwiches (on pita bread): pick your meat (lamb or chicken), size (small, medium, large), and sides (get the combo which comes with fries and a drink). I tried the chicken, and it was good, although I wish the meat had been a little more grilled (it wasn't crispy at all). Their fries are great! They also have a few other things on the menu (regular sandwiches etc), and they're open late most nights. I'll be back for sure.", 
      "Back in the day, this is the place where I would go on campus if I wanted \"ethnic\" food. Yes, having a gyro is ethnic enough when your main options are otherwise pizza and burgers. Still, even after my exposure to other places, I still had my Zorba's craving. They were one of the few places I found that served chicken gyros with shaved chicken as opposed to chunks. I also ordered fries and, as they always have, they freshly fried them up for my order.", 
      "Reliably decent gyros, although I haven't seen much else that's very exciting about the place as of yet. \u00a0It does have its location going for it, though.", 
      "This past weekend, my bf and I did a quick trip to Champaign, because we just needed to get out of Chicago for a couple of days. \u00a0When we parked our car and walked down Green St., there were a whole bunch of NEW restaurants compared to when I went to college years ago. \u00a0One familiar restaurant was Zorba's. \u00a0Got two med. gyros, fries, and drinks to go. \u00a0When we sat outside on the quad, we upwrapped a tightly rolled gyro. \u00a0So eating it outside on a windy day was not a problem at all! \u00a0Really good and the pita seemed fresh and light, not super greasy like the joints here in Chicago. \u00a0Don't think I'll go back to Champaign for a long time, but it's a great lunch/dinner option.", 
      "Based solely on their gyros: 5 stars. \u00a0Absolutely delicious. \u00a0Not too much sauce, succulent meat, crisp onions, tomatoes, all on fluffy, chewa pita bread. \u00a0I am wowed by the fact that you can choose your size of gyro. \u00a0I think a medium gyro (4oz) is perfect for filling you up without overwhelming your stomach. \u00a0AND, it's under $5. \u00a0Yum, yum, yum.", 
      "This is where I spend 20 minutes every Tuesday night. \u00a0Good gyros, cucumber sauce, etc., and thanks to Groovy Tuesdays you can get a kickass feta (+hummus, if you like) veggie pita for a little over $2. \u00a0Service is fast and it's not usually too crowded. \u00a0Nice, tall tables too."

      "Restaurant reviewI am glad that I am back by Za's after moving back to Champaign. This was my favorite place to eat at on campus when I was a medical student. Now that I am back I have found out that there are multiple locations which works out well. The prices are actually cheaper than when I was here for college due to a modification in the menu. For the pasta you get to select from multiple types and sauces with 4 toppings for 5 dollars. The premium protein items i.e shrimp, meatballs, chicken will run you a dollar more each. The food is prepared quickly, however I don't know if they changed it now to use a convection oven/microwave to nuke your toppings which is one down side. This is then added to a pan with the sauce and served quickly. You also get a nice piece of garlic bread. All and all this is better than McD and for the same price. There are also other options such as pizza, salads, sandwiches etc. I have never strayed from the pastaPro: inexpensive, quick, large portionsCons: microwaved toppings (i guess you get what you pay for)Hidden gem:Sign up for the perka app. You need to check in and tell the cashier so they can give you the punch to earn free food. I did not realize this and ended up not getting my first check-in. You can't just check-in which makes sense or people would abuse the system", 
      "Eh this place is really a hit or miss. The first time I came I got a panini and it was pretty good. I got 4 toppings yet there was still barely anything on the bread. They were extremely skimpy on the toppings. My friends who got the pasta and pizza were very happy though. The second time I got a Caesar salad and tomato basil soup. Pretty simple order. My Caesar salad was incredibly soggy yet didn't really taste like anything. It tasted like they watered down their dressing..? My soup came lukewarm and wasn't anything special. This place is alright but really nothing special.", 
      "Ugh, what happened to Mia Za's? It used to be a great place to go to for a quick, customized lunch. Now the pasta is obviously frozen, portions are small, Alfredo sauce almost flaky. The amount of meat they give you is lackluster and the salad dressing is weirdly fake-tasting. Some pros are: big and roomy. Convenient location. Very customizable. I used to go often. Now I go never. Even with their price tag, it's not worth it. If you want cheap, quick food, do Chinese. Do McDonalds.", 
      "Went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Walking into the restaurant is information overload - flashing signs with complicated juice ordering methods (I'll have 3-F?) and a menu with hundreds of lines of text. The entire process of ordering is time consuming and a bit confusing, in my opinion. The food itself is pretty unappetizing. I ordered the \"Asian\" menu item which was rotini noodles doused in a prepackaged ginger sauce. I added \"grilled\" chicken that was obviously anything but grilled; if I would have to guess I would say boiled. It also came with a cold and soggy piece of overly buttered garlic bread. I really love eating food and always finish my plate but this time I left half of the dish.I'm leaving a 2 star rating because I think 1 star is reserved for when something horrible happens. However, I will not likely ever eat at this restaurant again.", 
      "The italian panini is so delicious! Also it's decently priced! Yum yum yum they also have sanpellegrino in every flavor which makes me the happiest person.", 
      "Besides my own personal anxiety at places where I have to fill out a paper about what I want to eat I am glad I picked Mia Za's for lunch. $5 Whole Wheat Wednesdays (pizzas or paninis) I ordered a whole wheat margherita pizza upon the recommendation of a co-worker. Normally stay away from margherita pizzas because they can be very bland. This one was not it was bursting with flavor! It was so good. Writing this review makes me want another one. The smoothies are also very tasty.", 
      "As an alumnus of the University of Illinois, I often get a little teary-eyed when I visit the campus and think of both good and bad experiences I encountered there when I was a student in the mid-1960s.I also got teary-eyed with joy when I saw Mia Za listed under the local chamber of commerce's list of \"Dining on a Dime\" restaurants near the campus. \u00a0i.e., I assumed it was cheap (and it was).My youthful bride of 34 years (Mrs. B) and I were checking out the restaurants in the Campus town area just northwest of the Alma Mater statue. \u00a0While looking at the bill of fare at this establishment, the owner came out and gave us a sales pitch for having our dinner there.This is a very small \"hole in the wall\" place that probably seats no more than 20 diners. \u00a0Tables are on the first floor and also on a second floor.The gimmick here is that you are provided with a ballot-like menu to order your food. \u00a0We both decided to order a pasta meal. \u00a0So, we filled out a paper form that allows you to select the type of noodles, sauce, toppings, and other items you want to eat. \u00a0Then you hand the form to the counter attendant, and they call you when your meal is ready: usually in less than ten minutes.The same procedure is used to choose salads, paninis, and pizza.We were there at about 5:45 on a Monday during the summer session, so the place was not busy. \u00a0But given the lack of space at Mia Za, it could look like Groucho's stateroom in \"A Night at the Opera\" during the fall and spring semesters.", 
      "This place is okay only if you're really hungry between classes and don't have a lot of time to eat. However it's way too overpriced and they barely give you any food. I wouldn't eat here if I was able to just go home and make the food myself since they basically give you crappier versions of food you can make at home.", 
      "I've been here a couple of times, and the food is tasty, but the portions are small. It's by no means expensive, but I feel like you get less pizza, for example, than you should for the price.There are tables and a few booths upstairs, big enough to hold about 6 people each, so it's good to go with a small group of friends. If you want Italian food that isn't too fancy and close to the quad, this is a pretty good choice.", 
      "Ate here twice in the past 2 days. What a nice surprise find in a college town. All fresh ingredients and you can customize your order fully. We had salads, pizzas, panini. Everything was delicious and came out quickly. Wish we had one of these at home!", 
      "The build your own is so phenomenal! You can customize the heck out of your meal and mix and match with soup or salad just like a U Pick 2 at Panera. The food is delicious, but I have noticed that they omit some of the ingredients you ask for.", 
      "This place is a favorite among U of I students! I came here for the first time yeeears ago on my violin teacher's recommendation (she is a \u00a0U of I graduate and had many fond memories of the place). I have been here several times since; I always try to stop by when I'm in the neighborhood. Za's has an excellent location near campus and a lot of other restaurants, apparel shops, ice cream/froyo places, etc. Eating here can be a bit overwhelming at first because there are SO many options! You fill out a sheet of paper to describe exactly what you want with options from salads, paninis, soups, pizzas, smoothies, and more. The big selling point of Za's is that you can customize your order to exactly how you want it with any toppings, sauces, or flavors--any way you want it! After ordering, you scoot on over to the pick-up counter and wait for your food to be ready. There are tables both upstairs and downstairs, so don't fret if every table is taken on the first floor. The stairs are kind of steep, so be careful as you walk up there with your food! I usually order the \"pick two\" option. My favorite is the broccoli cheddar soup with the \"lite panini,\" which can be customized exactly how you want it. The broccoli cheddar here is one of my favorites and has grated cheddar cheese on top. Yum. The food is by no means mind-blowing. Overall, this is your standard Italian lunch food with a few very above average options, like the soup. I also highly recommend trying the smoothies here (my drink of choice is the mango). They use real fruit and fruit juice!Honestly, if you're in the area, you really can't miss a stop at Za's. Note: I last ate here before it burned down, so I can't speak to the quality of the original's replacement.", 
      "A word to the wise, don't get their salads. 2/2 on the times I have ordered salads, I got that green squishy stuff that you typically reject when making your own salads at home. Throwing vegetables (and sometimes fruit) in a bowl doesn't constitute a salad, folks. The pizza and pasta are ok though.I am still giving it 3 stars because they have a good selection of iced tea and the extraordinarily eclectic ambiance. There is wall art of unique silhouettes like a cat dangling from a power line and a ninja on a bike upstairs which are modestly entertaining. But there is also a great little function where you can text in a song request and a monitor will play the song and video.My choice?Birthday Song - 2 Chainz ft. Kanye West.3 stars.", 
      "Za's is average, and it fascinates me as it's basically a pseudo-Italian factory of food. \u00a0The server could barely hide her snarl when I asked a question, but that's because they were serving about 3,000 people at once. \u00a0Honestly, it felt like Henry Ford was making a Model T-ortelini.I do like that you can customize salads and sandwiches and pasta--and that lemon cream sauce is DELICIOUS.However, it has all the personality of a computer science grad student, and the old-style Italian movie poster lend very little charm.Yet I know I'm going to be hungry at some point in the middle of the day and forget to bring my lunch.And then Henry Ford's Italian Motor Cafe will be there for me.", 
      "Things I felt upon visiting Za's for the first time:- overwhelmed at the number of options for lunch (pizza, pasta, paninis, and salads comprise your choices that you'll fill out on a custom form)- impressed that there are 200 meals you can put together at less than 500 cals!- comfortable in the spacious upstairs dining area- healthy after eating my 1/2 salad-1/2 panini lunch combo- elated I found somewhere that includes edamame in some of their saladsUnique lunch spot!", 
      "Za's took me back to the days of Radical Rye in Madison, WI. \u00a0Yes, one is a pizza/toasted sandwich place and the other was a sandwich place, but the binding tie is that you can customize your order on a little sheet of paper. \u00a0For someone who gets anxious at Starbucks trying to remember all the components that she has to say in the right order (lest she look like a dumbass), an uncomplicated, fill-in-the-bubbles order form is a god-send.After wading through the many, MANY options for customizing my 'panini,' I handed in my order. \u00a0While the girl behind the counter was not particularly pleasant, it was lunch time on Green St., so I guess I can't fault her too much. \u00a0My sandwich came out pretty quickly, so no complaints there. \u00a0Now, the sandwich.....heaven. \u00a0It's possible that I'm just really good at looking at ingredients and creating a delicious sandwich. \u00a0I'm not above tooting my own horn there. \u00a0But I think it's also possible that Za's just makes a mean toasted sandwich. \u00a0Since they serve it open-faced, I can't really go along with their calling it a 'panini.' \u00a0And it needs to be eaten with a knife and fork. \u00a0But it was delicious. \u00a0In case you're curious (and I know you are), the tasty sandwich I had went like this: Veggie (no meat) panini with pesto mayo, mushrooms, red onions, artichokes, red peppers, spinach, and roma tomatoes, smothered with their gouda/mozzarella cheese. \u00a0I'm going to call it the Heather's Vegetarian Fake-Healthy Heart Attack Express. \u00a0That's going to catch on, just watch.*P.S. A safety warning: I'm 95% sure my wallet was stolen out of my shoulder bag while upstairs at Za's. \u00a0So....practice good sense, which I didn't, and don't leave your bag unattended while you get utensils and napkins.", 
      "\"Mia Za's\"? \u00a0The hell? \u00a0I'm pretty sure that when I was in college ('03-'07), this place was just plain old \"Za's.\" \u00a0But that was back in the DAY, back when shit was REAL.It's true, this place has no personality, but the food is serviceable and I like building my own pizza/salad/sandwich/pasta dish. \u00a0The pizza crust is super-thin and crispy, and I like that the salads are ENORMOUS. \u00a0The pasta...I could live without. \u00a0I don't know why, but it kind of reminded me of pasta they might serve in the dorms. \u00a0GOOD dorm pasta, yes, but still dorm pasta. \u00a0Maybe that makes sense only in my head?", 
      "Mia Za's here on Green Street is the original. The other places of similar name (just, \"Za's\") \u00a0in Champaign have disbanded from the franchise and are their own entities. Mia Za's is located in a cozy little row of businesses in the heart of Campus Town conveniently adjacent to the University of illinois' main Quad. \u00a0Parking can be a bit difficult, but there are usually spaces available a block or two from the location, bring money as Parking Enforcement is serious business in and around Campus.Depending on the time of day you may be hard-pressed to find ample seating for you and your dining companion as this place is very popular with the student population. If there isn't enough room on the main floor you can head upstairs to find more tables, and a warm atmosphere with a very beautiful copper ceiling, and Italian inspired artwork on the walls.Their menu is full of incredibly tasty and healthy ingredients, and everything is cooked to order. It'll probably take longer for you to decide on what to order with the custom Pizza, Pasta, Panini, and Salad options. But never fear for those you that are indecisive; Mia Za's offers more traditional favorites as well.Prices vary on what kind of sauce or items you get, and if you get extra items. With that said you can get a \"Pick 2\" where you get half an order of pasta, salad, or panini served with another half order of salad, soup, or panini for just shy of 7 dollars (without drink).", 
      "if you order a combo here, one out of the two items they bring out will have something odd about it. \u00a0the buffalo chicken salad that i ordered came topped with this frighteningly chewy, wiry fried chicken that I did not want to put in my mouth. \u00a0My friend's apple gorgonzola salad was unappetizing with a plethora of iceberg lettuce. \u00a0what does redeem za's is their selection of cheesecake factory goodies. good to keep in mind when you've had a bad day and you need something sinful to wash away the pain.", 
      "I love the soup here. \u00a0Tomato Basil and whatever special of the day is on the menu. \u00a0That, and the garlic bread, even though it's 80 cents.I tried a pizza once. \u00a0It was wet in the middle and pretty unencumbered by flavor.I tried a smoothie once. \u00a0It was aiight. \u00a0Never been compelled to try another.I tried a salad once. \u00a0It was pretty boring, and it made me miss Pluto's back in Palo Alto.But the tomato basil soup, I love. \u00a0It's divine with its small sprinkling of grated parmesan (?) cheese that melts only halfway even though you stir it. \u00a0One thing I don't appreciate is the impatient guy who calls out my name. \u00a0He was pretty obnoxious this one time when I didn't respond on the first call. \u00a0But rudeness and some small confusion about not having a form to just order soup won't keep me away from good soup on Green Street.Under 4 bucks for a bowl of soup that comes with a small piece of french bread is good eatz. \u00a0And fast, too.", 
      "It's cheap and gets the job done. Honestly if you want better pasta make it yourself, it really might be better.", 
      "I really enjoyed being the boss of my sauce and picking out exactly what pasta i wanted. They give you options of creating your own, picking one from their menu, or other customer's creations. what a great way to think outside the box.The service was prompt and portions were well worth it.", 
      "Oh Za's, how I love thee.It's changed a bit since I graduated, but it's always been one of my favorite places to get fresh-tasting, delicious food on Green Street. \u00a0Seriously, where else would you go? \u00a0I've been a fan for years.I have always loved their pastas the best, and they've really expanded the options. Last time I went, I got multigrain rotini with pesto and veggies. \u00a0It felt really healthy and light, even though it was a sizable portion. \u00a0The huge and delicious piece of garlic bread did kind of counteract the \"light\" feeling, however... \u00a0I also had one of their delicious smoothies, and I have never gone wrong by ordering any of their infinite combos. \u00a0Anything with mango in it is an automatic favorite of mine!Yeah, it's not gourmet, but for an inexpensive lunch that isn't fast food or a chain place, it's definitely the best you can get in Champaign. \u00a0And oh, the nostalgia factor...", 
      "A couple people have said it best, this place has no personality. But does that mean it doesn't have yummy food? Nope! Totally delightful. Went here last night before the dinner rush at around 4 pm. It's one of those places where they give you a sheet of paper with predetermined options on it OR the option to create your own pizza, pasta, salad, or sandwich. Most of the people working the counter are just college students and therefore not necessarily skilled in helping you create awesome meals. After staring at the overwhelming menu for a little while I ended up creating my own pizza. I had garlic marinara sauce with a feta/mozzarella mix topped with red onions, olives, and sun dried tomatoes. It was kick-ass! I ate (most) of the whole thing. I did give away some of it because it was too good not to share. I had been to this place a few years ago (before it burnt down and was rebuilt) and I remember having something delicious then, too! I believe I created a pasta that time.I really had minimal interaction with staff, but everyone seemed pleasant when I did need them to place the order. They don't really \"wait\" on you because it's seat yourself, leave your dishes at the table. Really all you're doing is ordering at a counter; kind of like a more fancy, involved, delicious subway concept.", 
      "Za's is the first place that I ever ate in Chambana when coming to visit for the first time (summer 2003). And yes, I do have tremendous loyalty to places of my past, so maybe I'm biased.But Za's is awesome. The food isn't going to change the world, but they're well controlled portions, and highly customizable dishes bringa very \"it's for me\" feel to Za's. The workers (mostly college kids) have always been nice, and I've never had a thing to complain about. The upstairs seating is good enough for big crowds, and it's never been too crowded.", 
      "So disappointed in Za's! I went through the drive through to get a combo soup and salad for $6.69 which is clearly advertised on the menu. \u00a0I placed my order and the total came to $8.59! \u00a0I was like \"what?? Did Champaign vote in another tax hike while I was asleep?\" \u00a0No, apparently the Caesar salad is a \"premium\" salad. \u00a0What's in a Caesar salad that makes it a \"premium\"? \u00a0Cheese, lettuce & dressing. \u00a0They can keep their cheese, lettuce and dressing. \u00a0That is way too much to pay for what it is.", 
      "This place serves the tastiest spaghetti and marinara I've ever had: the noodles and sauce form a perfect combination and exude a strong yet comfortable flavor. While it's not gourmet, it's a step way, way above ordinary red-sauce Italian, and it'll satisfy even the strongest cravings for something zesty. The price is great, too.Pretty much everything else on the menu---whether you customize it or not---will also be well prepared, well presented, and well received by your taste buds. Back in sophomore year of high school I had lunch here almost daily, and the only bad experience I can remember involved an unbearably spicy sauce that even my high-spice-tolerating Chinese friends agreed was over the top. (The chef may have just screwed up my particular order that day, but just to be safe, I'd stay away from any spicy option.)On a final note, I've always been surprised at how quickly my order is ready, regardless of how crowded the restaurant is.", 
      "I like Mia Za's, even though it's not exactly my first stop in Campustown. Lines tend to be long, and the meal I normally order is a bit steep for lunch. But it's good food and cheap Italian if you need a fix. I'm fond of the thin-crust pizza, and I normally get half with a spinach salad. But the menu is so diverse as to be overwhelming. Come prepared to fill out a scantron of deliciousness; it's totally worth it every once in a while, but the vast array of options slow the place down to no end.", 
      "I wasn't very impressed with the food. The garlic bread was tasty but the pizza was tiny and the soup was cold. It took us quite a while before our food was ready and i'm normally a very patient person.", 
      "Great paninis at Mia Zas, I enjoy how you select your food there on their sheets. It makes your meal very customizable.The atmosphere is good, sitting upstairs is great too. I knocked it 1 star for price, could be a little more affordable. Other than that, I was very satisfied.", 
      "One of my favorite restaurants in Champaign.Love the way I can customize my pasta and salads.Healthy, tasty and reasonable price.", 
      "This place is pretty good for fast Italian. \u00a0I would place it somewhere between Fazoli's and Biaggi's. \u00a0I've had their pizza, pasta, salad, and paninis, and all were flavorful and satisfying. \u00a0And, since it's become \"Mia Za's\" (instead of just Za's), everything comes on a slightly fancier plate!Regarding my visit today, I went with a co-worker who, upon seeing the line stretching out the door, said, \"...Did you want to go here, or...?\" \u00a0Despite the frightening line, everyone was soon inside and peering at the papers. \u00a0I definitely found the ordering papers overwhelming the first time I visited a Za's, but I didn't have to wait on my co-worker, who picked out a delicious meal pretty quick. \u00a0While we were waiting in line, there was a guy standing next to it checking papers and passing out cups to make sure they were clear before we got to the checkout. \u00a0This proved to be genius, because we were through the line in about five minutes. \u00a0In another 5-10, we had our food. \u00a0And it was good. \u00a0My only complaints were that my rotini wasn't exactly al dente and there were lots of onions and garlic in everything (but this is only bad for me personally).The prices vary, but if you get a lunch-sized serving and a drink, you can get out for $7-10. \u00a0If it's a little bigger, or you decide you want a slice of their delicious tiramisu, it's gonna be more like $12-15.Quick, (seemingly) fresh, 'licious.", 
      "I love you Za's and miss you.", 
      "Za's is back!!!! OK, maybe it's been back for a while, but this was my first time back in Champaign since they reopened post-fire. I was so pleased to see that they still function the same way - design your own pasta, salad, panini, or pizza. This place was a major staple in my college-kid diet. The pasta sauces are all really tasty, and there are plenty of healthy veggie toppings. Let's not forget the amazing garlic bread, which is one of the best parts of any Za's trip. Can we please talk about the fact that Za's really needs to open a location in the Chicago area? Until then, I'll just have to wait and get my fix next time I'm down in CU. Sigh.", 
      "Pretty standard fare here, you can customize everything, mix and match whatever crazy combination you can come up with. My absolute faaavorite \u00a0pasta sauces are the cajun alfredo and cajun pesto. I think they just add some kind of spice to make their normal sauces spicy but you should definitely try them if you like spicy food. I wish they could sell me just the sauces... that's all I would ever need in life. I'd add it to everything I eat.I always mean to try their desserts from the Cheesecake Factory but am always too full so either plan ahead to save room or get some to go!", 
      "Asian rotini stir-fry and garden salad, friend accidentally got full plate!", 
      "Good!", 
      "Za's is a pretty good lunch option on Campustown. They serve salads, pasta, sandwiches and pizza, all made to order. You can select from their suggested dishes or order your own by choosing ingredients. It's all very reasonable ($4 to $7), not great cuisine but very tasty nonetheless. To boot, the employees are all very friendly. It's just a three minute walk from my office, so I suspect I'll be going there a lot to eat.", 
      "I was so sad when I found out that Za's had burned down, but I'm glad that they have rebuilt. I love coming here because the service is friendly and the food is good. I come here when I need a quick bite to eat and they never fail to deliver. The ordering system is pretty straightforward. There are slips of paper with the menu items and you fill out what you want, such as proteins, veggies, etc. and give it to the cashier and voila...that's it. Quick and simple.", 
      "This food is very delicious. I have only bought the pizza from there which is delicious, however after an hour or two you'd be hungry again due to it being a thin crust pizza. I don't think there is an option for thicker crust though. The cash register lady is also very kind and friendly as well. Food only takes a couple minutes to be finished as well."

      "I have only ever had the tom yum soup and a couple of appetizers, but they were all delicious!I love everything about this place except that you bus your own table. Cleaning up after myself is not the problem- other peoples messes are. Usually they get cleaned up quickly, but not always. Overall, I would recommend.", 
      "We were in Urbana for our son's violin lesson, and decided to stop here. I'm frankly in no hurry to come back. This is a very \"do it yourself\" sort of place. I'd rate the service, but the only thing exceptional about it was its absence. You order and pay up front and bus your own table, which is kind of at odds with the menu and prices. I ordered the Mussamun curry, which is my favorite Thai dish. I've never been disappointed until today. It was weirdly tangy, and missing both the sweetness and spiciness I generally expect. My wife enjoyed her Pad Thai, but it tasted really oily to me, with too much cabbage. There's no kids' menu, so we had to improvise. We got them chicken fried rice to share. Funny enough, this was far and away the best dish we tasted tonight. It was legitimately good, and about the only thing saving it from 1-star.It's disappointing... I expected to get much better Thai food in Champaign/Urbana than I get in Bloomington.", 
      "Food is okay. Relatively cheap and also quick. \u00a0Location is good within walk distance for a lot of department", 
      "I love Basil Thai. It's a bit a ways from Green Street but I'd trek here for Thai over Bangkok Thai. That said, Basil doesn't belong in the better Thai food category. But it's pretty damn good. A bit too salty, but I love it for not being goopy as some other Thai restaurants do their food.", 
      "This place has a decent pad thai, my only complaint being that its on the sweet side. I think their pad thai is better than that of Bangkok Thai, except that its also more expensive with smaller portions.I don't understand why other reviewers are complaining about having to bus tables when most restaurants in campustown are like that too.", 
      "Pretty lack-luster on all fronts and not worth the trip. I've eaten here probably a dozen times as it's close to where I work, but it's always a disappointment. Depressing atmosphere that smells strongly of the Subway next door. It's not particularly appetizing, unless you're really into subway (and in that case, just go to the subway). Be prepared to wait for a long time for your food during peak hours--despite being a walk up and order kind of place, it's definitely not fast food. Curry is the worst with very little flavor. Pad Thai is so oily. Two high points: Cashew chicken and vegetable noodle soup. The veggie noodle soup is bland (kind of my expectation for noodle soup...) but it's reliable, filling, and cheap! And the cashew chicken has pineapple. Yum.", 
      "The service is good. Like the pad Thai with ground chicken and veggie& tofu red curry. Prefer 4-star spicy.", 
      "Unpleasantly surprised by the mushiness of my pad Thai. I've never had bad pad Thai before. A little pricey (over $9) for such untasty food. Abrupt service, but it came out quickly and is convenient for study grub.", 
      "The classic Pad Thai is really good (and makes excellent leftovers), some people say it is a little sweet and it is but still really tasty.The thai tea with milk though is super delicious, I recommend everyone try it!", 
      "I have given Basil Thai a fair chance, eating there half a dozen times even though I don't think the food is excellent. All the stir fry's taste the same. The rice is good. Noodle soup servings are on the smaller side. The service is horrible. It basically comes down to cultural differences. The customer is almost never right. My last trip, my friend and I decided to share a dish. I asked for extra rice. I opened up the menu to the list of \"sides\", pointed at it, and said \"extra jasmine rice\". The cashier wrote our order on the receipt and wrote something in Thai under our. I assumed it was an extra plate of rice.Our order came with one plate. I told the Hispanic server that we didn't get our extra rice. He nodded and went away. It was apparent the rice wasn't coming, so I talked to another lady at the counter. She said I had to pay for the rice. I said I had ordered it. She said I didn't. We figured out that the cashier thought I wanted MORE rice (we didn't get more than a normal serving though), not a separate side order of rice. This misunderstanding is fine, but she insisted I pay for the rice. Rice is very cheap! It wasn't my fault the cashier didn't understand my order for \"extra rice\". I was turned off by the whole exchange. To top it off, the rice we had and were eating had a small strand of hair in it! On our way out, I told the cashier that I found hair in our rice. I thought they should know. The lady didn't respond at all to me. She just turned around and walked into the kitchen. If you want excellent Thai food and good service, go to Nitaya in downtown Champaign instead.", 
      "The restaurant itself is well decorated and very clean. It is located on the border if Urbana and Champaign, which may be a little far for some students. However, there is always a dinner rush. That itself speaks volume of it's food quality. The speed of which they prepare your food is pretty fast, considering how each dish is freshly made. Though it may appear slightly princely compare to other restaurants on UIUC campus, it is well worth the extra dollar or two, especially if you like spicy Asian cuisine.I almost always get their Thai ice tea, which still taste sweet upon dilution with a cup if water. My personal favorite is their Tom Yum noodle soups since I am a sucker for noodle soups. Their deserts are also delicate in comparison to other places nearby and will not disappoint! I highly recommend coming here!", 
      "Food is not bad. But staff is not friendly. Closed at 9:30 pm, but take out only after 9.", 
      "Don't do it. \u00a0We were sorely disappointed. \u00a0I love me some panang curry- this tasted nothing resembling panang curry. \u00a0The service was abominably slow for a place where you order at the counter. \u00a0My husband had sweet and sour chicken - or at least that's what they called it. \u00a0There are better places in town with better food, service and prices.", 
      "I'm not the type of person who lets one bad experience ruin a restaurant, I know that sometimes people make mistakes and running a restaurant can't be easy.I went here 3 TIMES, and every time something bad happened.First time I went here, food was good if not expensive, but immediately afterwards I felt a sharp pain of sickness to my stomach. Let's end the story there.Second time, food was alright with no \"incidents\" until my friend discovered a long black hair in his food. That's flavour country! \u00a0OK, so it's one hair - NOPE, there's another friendly hair in his food! The guy working there refuses to give a refund, only offering more of the same food that had made my friend feel like throwing up after his nice discovery. Good business!OK, Basil Thai - you get one more try. I go there and my other friend orders Basil Chicken which is made with \"ground chicken.\" Upon receiving the order, we notice the chicken is \"ground\" into pieces of the size of bacon bits, not to mention there was barely any of these \"chicken bits.\" So, we ask for more chicken, since it's a chicken dish, and the same douchebag refuses, saying we should pay for more chicken and that it's \"our fault\" for not reading the description. He refuses to give a refund because \"we already paid for it.\" What the fuck? How exactly would you get a refund if you haven't paid for something in the first place? Genius! No reason to go here, if you crave Thai food - make it yourself and save yourself assholish service and high prices.", 
      "Basil Thai would not make any one's top ten Thai list if they included places outside of C-U, but it's well worth a stop if you 're hungry in the area. \u00a0The space is a bit sparse, yet it's pleasantly decorated. Decent is the watchword for Basil Thai. \u00a0The place feels like a gussied up cafeteria with nice little touches. \u00a0The curry was...okay. \u00a0It was my fault for trying to be super manly and ordering it as extra spicy, and they delivered, but of course that obscured the full range of the curry's flavor for me. \u00a0And I went through four glasses of water. \u00a0But that's how things go.So if you've learned anything from this review, please remember: Basil Thai is decent, and masculinity is not safely garnered by eating super spicy stuff.", 
      "Basil Thai: where good Thai goes to die.It is THAT bad, in terms of service, taste, and cost.", 
      "You are a solid place, Basil Thai. \u00a0I am glad that you exist, particularly because you give the student population (read: not me) a decent Thai eatery. \u00a0That's nice of you.Basil Thai, I walked in at Noon--the height of your busy time--but you just keep churning right through the line. \u00a0People were getting their food quickly and no one looked dissatisfied. \u00a0Granted, the harried girl taking orders did order me to WAIT UNTIL I GET MY SODA (I was waiting, mind you, I'd just stepped to the side for the next person to order), it was still all okay.The food was really nothing to write home about, though. \u00a0The tofu was a little smushy for my liking (I know, I know. \u00a0\"It's tofu, Heather, is it supposed to be crunchy?\"), and while it was spicy enough, it lacked flavor....given that it was red curry. \u00a0I was happy with the amount of veggies you put in, though, Basil Thai. \u00a0Thanks for an a-okay meal.", 
      "This is a nostalgic review, since I used to live in the Gregory Place apartments above the restaurant and ate here ALLLLL the TIIIIIIIIIIME. \u00a0And I really only have experience eating the chicken pad thai, so I can't speak too confidently about their other menu items. \u00a0Nevertheless, I give them a solid 4 stars.Sure, their Engrish is not so good, and apparently they have a no-refund policy even when customers are furious (although one time, I asked for chicken pad thai and they misunderstood me and gave me chicken satay, and they quickly corrected their mistake when I said something and they didn't charge me, so it hasn't happened to me). \u00a0It's quick, it's cheap, it's delicious, and it's guaranteed to cure your hangover. \u00a0And the restaurant space is white, bright, and pretty! \u00a0Sitting by the window is perfect for people-watching.", 
      "Definitely my place of choice to get some good Thai food on campus. \u00a0I usually go for the Pad Thai or Pad See Ewe with chicken, but their other noodle dishes as well with their curries and rice dishes are also tasty. \u00a0There is also a good selection for if you are vegetarian (you can replace any of the meat with tofu or mixed vegetables). \u00a0Can't say I'm a big fan of their noodle soups though - I find them kind of bland. Price-wise, at $6/$7 a dish, it costs approximately the same as if you were to grab lunch on Green St., but this is definitely the place to go to sit back, relax, catch up with friends, study, etc. while grabbing a bite to eat if you have some extra time.While they do tend to err on the greasy side, I have never been dissatisfied with an order, and their friendly service coupled with the clean, open decor (much nicer than their sister location on Green St.) is very refreshing compared to many of the grungy feeling restaurants/cafes around campus and keeps me coming back.", 
      "Basil Thai is a decent Asian eatery on campus. It's very convenient for the Urbana-side dormers or residents as it is right between the Allen and the ISR dormitories.They've got most of the staple Thai items, from the egg/spring rolls, to the pad thais/pad se-ews, to the curries and salads. Thai iced tea is always a great to-go option as well. I think Basil Thai offers quick turnaround times for your orders, convenience, and affordable prices for the college kids. It really deserves four stars if Golden Wok had not existed.", 
      "My husband tried to change his order literally thirty seconds after he placed it and was told it was too late. When he went to pick up our food, the soup I had specifically requested be spicy was NOT spicy at all and they packaged it up totally carelessly so that most of it spilled out on the way home. When he told them he was never, ever coming back there because of his bad experience, they just shrugged. Since I'm currently home sick and most places are closing and I need spicy soup in order to live through the night I am seriously considering plastering their windows with fliers that say 'FUCKING RUDE ASSHOLES WITH BAD SOUP' after my recovery from the flu.Obviously, this is totally fucking unacceptable and extremely bad business. I order a ridiculous amount of thai food and will never be back to this place - this is my karmic retribution for trying to stray from Siam Terrace.", 
      "I discovered Basil Thai on a visit to UIUC in high school. \u00a0At the time, I was just getting into Thai food, so I had very little experience with it. \u00a0I got the pad thai and thought, \"Wow this is really good!\" \u00a0Well, over the years, I've eaten a lot more Thai food and my opinion of Basil Thai has gone down. \u00a0But don't get me wrong, I'm not a Thai food elitist (I save that for sushi) and I still do enjoy eating here.I used to only get the pad thai here, but now my go-to dish is one of the salads, yum moo I believe it's called. \u00a0Lots of lettuce, topped with thinly sliced pork, with a delicious and somewhat spicy dressing. \u00a0I definitely recommend it. \u00a0I've sampled other dishes as well, and they're all pretty tasty. \u00a0Not the best Thai I've had, but I still keep going back. \u00a0It helps that it's cheap!In general, I've always had a good experience here. \u00a0The food is made relatively quickly and it's always come as I've ordered. \u00a0I've come a few times with large groups (12-14 people) and it's actually pretty nice to not have to deal with waiter service. \u00a0There's no wait for a table (assuming you can push some together, but you usually can) and no issues with getting separate checks or dealing with tips. \u00a0If you're looking for top of the line Thai food, you should probably keep looking. \u00a0But if you're looking for a quick Thai fix, definitely give Basil Thai a try.", 
      "I first discovered Basil Thai freshman year at the University, when I lived at Allen Hall. I'd eat there on weekends with friends before we headed out to hang out and have fun. The first dish I ordered there, Pad See Ewe, I instantly became a fan of. It remains unchanged on their menu, which keeps me going.For the price of their entrees (~$7), you're bound to leave the place happy and content. The thai iced tea, while a bit on the expensive side, is also a treat with any meal. Unfortunately it's price and the lack of free refills (~$2) makes me feel a bit unsatisfied.It's certainly not the best thai food I've had, but it's definitely not the worst either. I remain a fan.", 
      "Without much competition close to campus, Basil Thai is pretty much the only viable lunch-time option for students craving a bit of southeast Asia. \u00a0The setup of the restaurant is obviously catered towards students; much like other campus restaurants, there is no wait staff and customers are expected to clean up their own dishes when finished.I've sampled a broad range of dishes at Basil Thai, and my favorites are the tom yum noodle soup and egg noodle/BBQ pork soup (particularly comforting in winter). \u00a0While the pad thai and pad see ewe are good enough to sate a noodle craving, they are somewhat mediocre. \u00a0I also dislike the tofu used in their curry dishes as it is plain cubed tofu (soft-ish and flavorless), whereas many places often choose a hearty, smokey bean curd instead.I attend student lunch meetings that are frequently catered by Basil Thai. \u00a0The employees are very familiar with our group and the protocols associated with the university (including tax-exemption policies), and they now throw in free appetizers (usually fried spring rolls) when we order. Many of the complaints from other reviewers seem to be primarily associated with food poisoning and (strangely) the basil chicken. \u00a0I've eaten at Basil Thai well over 50 times in the past 3 years, and I've never personally encountered food poisoning (fingers crossed?). \u00a0As for the basil chicken, I am sure that there are all sorts of regional variations of this dish, but I am mostly familiar with the ground chicken version that seems so revolting to my fellow reviewers. \u00a0Google a recipe for the dish and you'll see that Basil Thai isn't using ground chicken just to be offensive.", 
      "This location is much nicer than the one in Champaign- better lighting, a decent ambiance, and table service. Its a particular favorite for groups because you pay up front and don't need to worry about splitting the bill. The quality of food really depends on what \u00a0you order. Chicken, except for the satay, is typically not high quality. Beef is the better choice if you like meat. Vegetarian dishes are quite good here though and they do use a lot of vegetables I like such as zucchini and bell pepper. I like the curries and they are pretty spicy, but lack a certain complexity in flavor present at other Thai places. The only truly atrocious curry, which you should avoid, is the panang, which is almost like vegetables in a thick sauce rather than a curry.Besides the curries, I love the Thai veggie egg roll appetizer- noodles and vegetables rolled in a rice pancake. Beats Chinese egg rolls any day. Unfortunately the spring rolls are not so good. They are assembled bizarrely so you can't really eat them without seeming just a little rude as they fall apart in your hands and you are forced to gobble each piece in one giant bite. The peanut spring rolls are the worst offender, as they are both improperly assembled and drenched in a sweet sticky sauce. Not the best Thai food, but a good choice for groups and vegetarians.Just to warn you, but their tray system is idiotic. You clear your own tray and the rack you put them on doesn't fit the trays well. Glass breakage and embarrassment ensue.", 
      "Don't know why all the hate, it's good cheap thai food. Don't get their peanut sauce dishes, and definitely don't get the spring rolls--they are not the vietnamese spring rolls you might be used to.Stick to the popular dishes and you'll be fine. Their sliced beef noodle soup is just as good as it was 6 years ago.", 
      "Stopped by this weekend while visiting some friends for Unofficial weekend.I got a Pad Kee Mao with beef. It was okay tasting, not the best I had though. There was plenty of noodles, but I didn't think there was enough veggies or meat. The price is decent though. And they are pretty quick about getting the food done.The cashier guy couldn't understand what I was saying when I wanted to get a bottle of water. Just be nice and patient.", 
      "I love this place! I remember I used to come here for Thai food at least once a week. I bet my roommate thought I was a little too crazy, haha. I tried their curry dishes before but they weren't my cup of tea. Pad See Ewe with chicken was one of my favorites during freshman year. Ever since then, I would order their Pad Kra Paow (sp?) with chicken, which is the basil chicken (ground). The portion is very good in my opinion - one order would normally last me two meals. I *always* order my food from there with 2 stars when it comes to spiciness. I love my food spicy! No Thai restaurants in Chicago makes their Pad Kra Paow like them! I've tried at least 7 different restaurants already and it disappoints me every time. Sometimes I feel like driving at least 2 hours down to Chambana *just* for this dish. The wait is not too bad but if it's during lunch time, it can get pretty ugly. Grab one of their menu, phone in your order, and get it to-go so you won't have to wait more than 10 minutes for your meal. I used to call in a lot and pick it up when I walk in. Also, they do cater food so make sure you ask them about that. I took my siblings and 2 friends here post-graduation. I did call in beforehand to reserve a table. They're pretty good with this! They have another restaurant on Green St. but I think the food tastes a lot better here. I believe they have the same owner for these two Thai restaurants on campus.", 
      "If someone were to ask for a recommendation for Thai food in Champaign-Urbana, I would not send them here. That said, this is usually where I go when I'm looking to get Thai on campus. The staff is always extremely nice and the prices are not terrible. The food is not the best, but it's always edible (by college student standards, at least).The main issue I have with their food is the overwhelming greasy-ness. I've never had a pad thai so oily and \"fried\" tasting. It's good, but it's heavy. And it's not what I'd consider \"pad thai\", rather some sort of Basil Thai original creation. The other noodle dishes are all the same way. The main dishes with rice are better, but still nothing memorable. Salads are absolutely not recommended, with greasy meat thrown on top of chopped iceberg lettuce. I have heard good things about the soup, but never tried it myself. What I have enjoyed is their curries. I can't remember which specific one I got, but it is the only thing I remember ordering there that I felt fit in with all the other Thai food I've eaten in my life.The Urbana location is a nice place to sit and eat-in as well, as opposed to the one on Green Street which is far less classy.", 
      "Alright, Sorry, but I would have to not recommend coming to this place. The problem with it is that 1) the portions are so small for such a mediocre price range, the couple times I've been the curry just has not been very good. I've ordered the Pad Thai and well, it's been alright, but the beef \u00a0was overcooked, and honestly Golden Wok is pretty much a better padthai / pad see ew place.", 
      "Picky American girl who spent three months in rural Thailand. I came here on a whim. I always get pad thai the 1st time I eat at a Thai place to see how they manage this standard dish. Many complaints. While I am thrilled that they actually offer spicy food (you can pick from 5 levels, I chose 4), I expect the various elements of the dish to retain individual flavors, and this dish, as served to me, failed. Every bite tasted exactly the same. Egg tasted like tofu tasted like carrot tasted like broccoli. No lime came with it. This is an order at the counter place with no table service once they bring your food so I had to get up and ask. There were ground peanuts on my plate, but despite a table offering the traditional granulated sugar, hot green peppers, and a red hot pepper sauce, there was no option for more ground peanut. The tofu was cut into tiny bits which made them hard to find. The veggies on the other hand were roughly cut and much larger. Cooked well, though. Texture was right, but all one flavor. Once I was able to squeeze lime juice on it the meal improved somewhat, but I really didn't want to eat this once I took first few bites. I actually wondered where the last homeless person I saw was so I could pass this on. I'm taking the leftovers to go. Maybe I'll update this to say what I do with them. I expect they'll end up in the garbage. Disappointed.", 
      "I go to this place with my friends all the time. :) My favorite dish is their Lad Nar with beef, and I always get a glass of their Thai iced tea.", 
      "I loved the pad thai from this place. It was little too saucy, but the taste was awesome. And I love the amount of peanuts you got with this. They were a little expensive, so that's why I took away one star. Good place to go for lunch though. I frequented this place a lot when I worked at UIUC. The decor is also really cool and they definitely have a lot of room for people to sit inside.", 
      "Yummy. Basil Thai is one of my favorite campus eats, so much so that I saved their number into my phone so I could call in orders and pick up after class. Whenever I was away at school, I would crave my mom's curry. Basil Thai is the next best thing and as good as it gets away from home. It is always clean, the service fast and really nice, and the food cheap and good. I love to catch up with friends in their cafe-style dining area. What is especially nice about Basil Thai and a couple of other campus restaurants is that it is self-service, meaning that you need to clean up after yourself and bring your empty plates and utensils to a cart when you are done. That means no expected tip! Great for any college student. The desserts and appetizers are not bad (except for the crab ragoons... they are just kind of a huge glop of cream cheese) but they are too over-priced in my opinion. Their main entrees are consistently good though!", 
      "So good and so cheap. Only downside is that you have to bus your own tables, but that comes with any college town restaurant. \u00a0I recommend the pad see ew.", 
      "This place is bloody awful. I went here one time my freshman year at UIUC and ordered their specialty- basil chicken (with fellow yelper Dan T who reviewed this location as well). The dish was pricey at $8 dollars a plate, but I was willing to give something different a try. Instead, when I received my order I got vegetables with ground up chicken bits that were about the size of the beef you would find in ground beef. I was immensely disappointed so I went up to the front counter to ask for a refund as this is not the dish I expected it to be. Instead, in Engrish, the manager said to me, \"you already pay. No refund.\" Uhm, excuse me?!?! If I paid for something and was unsatisfied, shouldn't I receive a fair refund? Not for this place apparently. Avoid at all costs and go somewhere else!", 
      "I've only ever gotten one thing here, Pad Kee Mao.First time I got it, I'd been up until 3 (flight got delayed from OHare), had a med school interview at 9, and didn't eat much the whole day. I was exhausted and had no idea where to eat. I wandered around for a while, pausing at manolo's pizza and empa\u00f1adas, before finding myself staring at BTU's vast menu. I needed something noodley and filling. I ordered the pad kee mao with chicken and walked back to the illini union, where I was staying. I opened the rectangular styrofoam container to find it packed completely full of noodles (this was right after they opened, since then they have raised the prices a tiny bit and the portions are a little smaller). They were greasy, and saucy, and there were a lot of vegetables (good ones too! broccoli, carrots, bell pepper). It was exactly what I needed. The chicken wasn't the best quality.. I haven't ordered it again. I've switched to the vegetables and tofu, which is much better. This is my go-to place when I'm feeling super hungry or a little under the weather. For $7 I get noodley goodness that perfectly fills my tummy! A tip: I think that when you order to-go you get a slightly larger portion than when you eat at the restaurant.", 
      "Dear Basil Thai, here is a business tip: this group of 9 people that I just brought in is not the only large group I will ever take out to lunch. By making me wait for my itemized receipt while you (repeatedly) checked out single diners, you are telling me that you value their business more than mine. I will not trouble you with my business in the future, as you appear to be unprepared and unwelcoming to university (business) diners.", 
      "This is the place to go if you're looking for a depressing atmosphere and an excuse to miss class because you're too busy nursing your GI tract. It's a cafeteria style 'restaurant' (I use that term loosely), with cleaning carts visible stacked in the dining area. The food in my opinion is overpriced, overcooked, and well dangerous to eat (I got sick after my first and only trip to this place). Not to mention the small portion size for the price you pay - I mean at most Thai places, you can get another meal out of your leftovers, but not here...I also want to mention how empty this place always is when I walk by (on my way to the Subways, or BBQ joint next door) - never a good sign.", 
      "Good place because its easy to find a table here. I order rice and curry dishes which are good. My girlfriend orders thai dishes and likes them. She is thai and likes the place because it reminds her of her mom's cooking. The dishes are average priced and sometimes the lunch rush is crazy."

      "My girlfriend and I were walking around campus looking for a sandwich/cafe type place to get lunch and chose The Bread Company. Walking in the door we were charmed by the atmosphere: mismatched chairs, chalkboard menus, and the wonderful smell of fresh bread! After a quick run through the menu I hastily chose the tuna salad on multigrain and my girlfriend had the mixed salad (pears, walnuts, blue cheese, raspberry vinaigrette). After ordering (and not yet paying), we were told to stand in an alternate line where we were to pay for our lunch. This is the only part of the restaurant that I didn't enjoy. We ended up standing in line for 10 minutes (with only one person in front of us!) waiting for the cashier to take our money. It's not that he was busy working, which would be completely understandable, he was walking around seemingly looking for people to talk to instead of working the register.Besides the payment debacle, we enjoyed the food immensely and will definitely be returning to try out dinner and brunch - hopefully by then the payment process will be a bit more streamlined ;)UPDATE:I've been to dinner here twice and LOVED it both times. The bread company is now part of my regular restaurant rotation.", 
      "Bread Company has been around for 15+ years, it is the kind of local place that visitors to town are likely to miss, but it's worth checking out especially for those who like to avoid chain restaurants.I recently stopped by for Sunday brunch--something I almost skipped because their website didn't list a brunch menu (I thought I knew most of the brunches in town and didn't know Bread Company was an option until today).The service was friendly, but like a lot of local restaurants, the timing was not-so-great and generally felt inexperienced.The waiter offered slow-drip pour-over coffee, but called the coffee \"blends\" when they were actually single varietals (sorry, coffee nerd here). The Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, though, was aromatic and worth the extra charge (though it's reasonable to expect that the menu had listed the price or the waiter had known it after I asked: no luck on either).I waited much too long to place my order after sitting (and it was not busy). \u00a0But the prosciutto and gruyere omelet (which I added spinach to with no problem) that arrived vastly exceeded expectations: it was flavorful, chock full of good ingredients and not overcooked. The pan-fried potatoes were spiced but not overly salty (though I sent them back when they arrived with a huge dollop of unmentioned sour-cream--ew).The baked bread was sourdough and crusty and a perfect accompaniment. Nice job, Bread Company. Great food. Lacking final star only because my waiter could have used some some further training on the menu and service timing.", 
      "Can't get your burger rare...they weren't sure about the meat today. \u00a0Staff was so quick to clean our table they took food we weren't finished with twice! \u00a0Couldn't get the waitresses attention to pay our bill. \u00a0Salmon salad was great..shrimp pasta fab..why no grated cheese or ground pepper?", 
      "Stumbled upon this gem for a bite for brunch. It's a quaint Swiss bistro with some pretty spectacular food! Tried the \"Quiche of the Day\"-ham and gruyere quiche- it was DELISH!", 
      "Pretty much my favorite spot in C-U. Relaxed atmosphere and very nice food. Love the salads, pizza and pasta.", 
      "SO and I came here for our anniversary: The Good:-We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation and were welcomed and seated promptly.-Atmosphere was nice but not stuffy, eclectic collection of chairs gave it a more casual feel-Waitress was extremely friendly and treated us well, happily accommodated us-The Fried Goat Cheese with honey and strawberries was dreamy, so delicious. -Basil Tomato Fondue was delicious, \"it tastes like pizza\".-Chocolate fondue uses dark chocolate, which makes it rich and not too sweet-Portions were generous, especially with the goat cheese appetizer, there was so much goat cheese that we ran out of bread! Our waitress happily accommodated us and brought more warm bread.The Bad:-Nothing!Overall:Fantastic! Food and atmosphere was great! Would love to come again.", 
      "Lovely experience here tonight! Service was wonderful and was complimented by getting to meet the owner, Lindsey. She and her husband took it over from his family recently (not exactly sure when) to continue the family tradition. Food was tasty - I had pesto pasta and husband had garlic pizza plus a French onion soup and bruschetta. Atmosphere was quite nice on the patio and we enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine that was reasonably priced. We had the privilege of talking with Lindsay further and learning about their takeover after getting a summary from the menus which include an overview on key individuals in the history of Bread company, including Lindsay and the original owner, her mother in law.", 
      "Something has got to be done about the abominable service at The Bread Company.. It's such a shame because their food is not bad, but the service is so badly below standard, I decided I am simply never coming back here.There is one particular worker with tattoos on his arm who is very insolent towards customers, raising his voice at them for asking questions.For months, I've ordered a grilled sandwich to pick up for lunch time, and the result is totally random. If the owner (tall bald guy) is there when you call, chances are you'll get a good sandwich with the potatoes and salad on the side, but if he's not there, watch out: there's no telling what you'll get. Sometimes they include potatoes and salad with the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they slice the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the sandwich is available since the grill is on, and other times it's not even available since they turn off the grill in the middle of the day to save money randomly.Today for example, I went to pick up my grilled sandwich to-go, and was surprised to see that on this occasion there were no potatoes and salad included, even though two weeks ago I ordered around the same time and they were included. So I asked the short-haired lady in front of me behind the register, \"are there potatoes and salad?\" (pointing at the sandwich) and she stared directly at my eyes without answering! So I repeated the question and she stood there completely quiet, staring at me without answering, when the tattooed arm punk butted in our conversation, cocked his head at me and yelled, \"didn't we go over this already?!\" Don't bother coming here. Unless the owner fires some of the incompetent and insolent flunkies buzzing behind the counter soon, this place needs to go out of business ASAP.", 
      "It had been a couple years since I last went to The Bread Company, and since today was a beautiful day to sit outside and eat a sandwich, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a go. \u00a0I got a half portobello sandwich, half strawberry salad - a delightful combination, and everything tasted fresh. \u00a0(I'm gonna have to figure out how to make that sandwich on my own!) \u00a0My boyfriend's salmon burger was pretty good, but served on bread and not a bun, which was kind of odd. \u00a0I also had the English Orange iced tea, which was refreshing and a little sweet without being cloying.Our waitress had a major stick up her ass, though, which is why I'm downgrading them a star. \u00a0Bread Co., why must you hire rude people? \u00a0More often than not, the people working here are gruff and disdainful of the customers. \u00a0I get it, you're too cool to smile. \u00a0I'm not asking for a hug at the end of the meal, all I'm looking for is service without a scowl.", 
      "If it's raining, and you're on campus, Bread Co. is the best place ever o eat a pretentious sandwich while watching the precipitation assault the pavement from the safety of your cozy table.The sandwiches are top-notch, and filling. \u00a0I've had the turkey pesto, and the portobello. \u00a0Both are delicious. \u00a0Double frosted brownies make you hate your lack of will power, but are suitably delicious as well. \u00a0Service is a bit aloof, but reliable. \u00a0Like all other elitist jerks out there, look for me savoring my expensive sandwich while reading a pretentious theorist. \u00a0I've got street cred to maintain.", 
      "Bread Company is across the street from my office on campus, and while I used to pick up a sandwich combo for lunch, I've since given up because the combo is so uneven. And now with the combo prices hiked up higher than ever --$10 for a half sandwich and cup of Campbell's soup?-- I probably won't be back for lunch either. The grilled cheese sandwich is substantial and generally yummy (though hot sandwiches are served during a very small time frame), but the salads and soups are serviceable to dire. I'm never very excited to eat their salads, which consist of slightly wilting greens, but the soups taste like they came from an industrial-sized Campbell's soup can. Murky chicken noodle broth and sparse chicken and noodle? No thanks. At lunch with a friend, her very basic soup held vegetables suspiciously similar to that recognizably uniform shape and size of the bagged frozen sort. It definitely does not seem as if the soups are freshly made, at all. The lunch hasn't ever made me want to come to dinner for fear of similarly cut corners.", 
      "Went here once, in 2007, on a first date with a hot chick I met while in college. Almost six years later...she's my wife. Yea, guess I'd say that's enough for 5 stars. Thanks Bread Company *brofist*Do I remember much about the food?...No. The only thing I remember was feeling underwhelmed by the bread. I mean, if the place is called \"Bread Company\" I expect the bread to be something special, you know what I mean? Whatever, I guess by now I'm over it.Bottom line: took my crush here on a first date, ended up getting a second date...a third...and yea, eventually I even got laid. Thumbs up, would recommend.", 
      "An OK , but not great, place to grab a sandwich for lunch. \u00a0Not surprisingly, they do have really good bread. \u00a0Horrible destination for dinner.The lines are long and the sandwiches are pretty decent at lunch time, and it's certainly worth a try if you've never been here before.I've been in twice for dinner and was very disappointed both times. \u00a0The first time I was here, the place was dead and there were maybe 2 other tables seated. \u00a0The other time was for Valentine's Day (stupid, I know), and the place was packed and seriously overbooked since they apparently had given reservations to everyone who called and asked for them.Both times, the service was very slow and the staff was *extremely* rude, to include elbowing and pushing customers during the crowded V-Day fiasco, which I found inexcusable. \u00a0The quality of the food was poor, the servings small, and the prices high. \u00a0There were definitely some interesting looking recipes on the menu, but the quality of the ingredients was very substandard so nothing tasted very good at all. \u00a0Produce is not fresh and all the fruits and vegetables I had on both occasions were over or under ripe and clearly prepackaged. \u00a0The first time I was in there, about 3 different entrees were ordered before we picked something they weren't out of.I only went back the second time for V-Day because I wanted to try out the chocolate fondue. \u00a0In addition to being waaaaaaaay overbooked, they were understaffed and had a limited V-Day menu that was basically just 6 or so items from the regular menu with the already high prices about doubled. \u00a0Portions were so unbelievably small that even after spending $75+ on dinner, we had to go to LaBamba's afterward because my husband was still really hungry. \u00a0Seriously, he was served a piece of lamb that was roughly the size of a sliver dollar and probably could've been eaten in one bite with a little effort. \u00a0Total time in restaurant was in the 3 hour range due to the poor service and inability to seat in accordance with reservations. \u00a0The chocolate fondue was served in a beat up saucepan that had something crusted all over the outside of it. \u00a0Chocolate itself was actually pretty good, but the amount of stuff they gave us to dip in it was staggeringly small and the vast majority of it consisted of bananas and apples that were overripe to the point they couldn't be eaten. Although it was fondue for two, there was only one piece each of the more high quality dipping items (cookie, strawberry, etc.)I will certianly not be back for dinner and probably not for lunch either since there are a variety of other lunch places in town that are just as good or better that are easier to get to, Paradiso in particular.", 
      "I popped in here once for lunch last summer, on the recommendation of my nutrition professor. \u00a0Our chat on carbs and training for races and triathlons led to \"you HAVE to go to the Bread Company!\" Though this overly subtle carb stop doesn't have a sign (anymore?) on its exterior, it can be identified by the variety of wine bottles lining the window sills. \u00a0There's a variety of sandwiches for the lunch hour, but I hit the Bread Company tonight, and my, do they swank it up for dinner.Dim lights, plentiful menu of pasta-pizza-sandwich options, and extensive specials list, including tapas. \u00a0Who knew? \u00a0I had the roast beef sandwich, served atop roasted potatoes and a light salad. \u00a0I think all of the sammies are served up open faced, so open your mouth, and get ready for a carbolicious meal.", 
      "I don't understand why the lunch and dinner here are so different. \u00a0Is there a different owner for each meal? \u00a0Lunch is self-service, no-frills sandwiches and soups. \u00a0In a word: plain. \u00a0Dinner is table service and can be good. \u00a0But they emphasize a gimmicky fondue service and the main dishes can be hit-and-miss. \u00a0The pizzas are solid. \u00a0Meat can be over or undercooked. \u00a0Order seafood... watch out!Why is it called the \"Bread Company\"? \u00a0They do appear to make their own bread, but it isn't that good. \u00a0Seems misleading. \u00a0Kind of like their \"specials\" list. \u00a0(It doesn't change.)", 
      "Excellent food, nice atmosphere. \u00a0They seem to have upped their menu in the last year, which is fine although makes for a higher bill at the end. \u00a0I'm usually happy to bring the kids along... the place has a very euro-bistro feeling.A minor gripe, however, is that the last few times we've gone the service has been less than stellar. \u00a0It seems they like to hire hip girls who aren't so interested in helping a family have a nice meal.", 
      "Came to this place completely by accident. We meant to go somewhere else and saw this place and decided it was too neat looking so we had to give it a try. The 4 star rating is heavily based on the food. The actual condition of the restaurant is more like 3 stars. It has nice ambiance but if you start looking too closely, you'll notice it is very deteriorated. Perhaps, why they dimmed the lights so much! :pThe food was delicious. All except for the bread, weirdly enough. It wasn't warm or fresh and was served with butter packets, not oil. Oh well. We ordered the goat cheese bruschetta and one of their pizzas. Can't remember which, but it was pesto based, not sauce. I loved it. The dough was doughy, not crispy. \u00a0For dessert, we had a mildly spicy carrot cake (which also had goat cheese! Yum!) My husband and I split all 3 items and it was enough for dinner and leftovers to bring home.", 
      "This is probably the best restaurant in Urbana. First of all, they bake their own bread and fresh pastries are available for breakfast everyday. My favorite is the cheese (gruyere) croissant because it is so flaky. It literally melts in my mouth. My coworker called it high class junk food but I call this good stuff. Sometimes, when I felt lazy to go to lunch, I would just buy a loaf of bread and eat that with a cup of coffee. The zufte or zoft, which is a Swiss specialty bread is amazing. It is fresh and out of the oven by 11am during school days. I have not seen other places in the area that sell zufte but the bread is really worth trying. Oh, if you have cravings for day old bread, they sell them at half price.They also have a wonderful selection for dinner. Daily specials change quite often but they have their regular dinner menu. I usually go with the daily special. This place also has fondue, both cheese and chocolate. I had both and I have to say that they are pretty stingy with their cheese and chocolate. I had barely enough to cover the fruit or bread. Do expect $12-$17 for entrees and about $10 for fondue. By the way, they sell cheeses too in the day.They have pretty good service but the people do not seem to smile a lot during the day, especially the owner. They should be happy because of the wonderful smell of fresh bread. The decor is a little European and has a fireplace at the corner which makes the place extra cozy in the evening. Anyhows, this place is highly recommended. I am sure you'll love it.", 
      "I'm amazed that they stay in business. The owner and manager are rude and have terrible customer service. The only one who is nice is the owner's husband. The food is ok, but the place is very unclean and not well maintained. I've seen flies buzzing around the place a lot. I haven't gone here fore years and do not recommend it at all.", 
      "When our department has to entertain guest speakers or job candidates, The Bread Company always becomes the default dinner/lunch location. \u00a0Embarrassingly, I've heard some job candidates comment that they were taken here for 3 different meals during their visit! \u00a0My department is probably at fault for their lack of imagination when choosing restaurants, but The Bread Company offers some benefits that elevate it to a top pick for business-casual university diners:(1) Location. \u00a0For people who have short lunch periods and need to be within walking distance of campus, this restaurant's location is unbeatable. \u00a0(And since it's next door to an Espresso Royale, you can grab a coffee after your meal, if desired.)(2) Atmosphere. \u00a0Most college restaurants resemble a McDonald's Playroom for adolescents: neon walls and heavy-duty plastic furniture, with underlying scents of urine and vomit. \u00a0While The Bread Company does have a hint of grunge, it also invokes a strong sense of urban, artistic chic. \u00a0There are real paintings on the wall (not poster prints). \u00a0At night, they bring out white tablecloth and mood lighting.(3) Price. \u00a0I think the prices are reasonable depending on who you ask. \u00a0This place IS pricey when compared to most campus restaurants, where students are always trying to squeeze their dollars. \u00a0Lunch generally runs around $7 to $10, which is not unreasonable when entertaining guests. \u00a0(And still comparable/cheaper than what you can get at Timpone's, the other \"nice\" restaurant in the area.)All of the food is fairly conservative, with obvious combinations of flavors (brie + portobello, turkey + pesto, etc.). \u00a0I think this is also a reason that it ranks highly among options for guests; you will find nothing offensive here in terms of food (but also nothing exciting). \u00a0The presentation tends to be elegant and you can tell that most of the ingredients are of good quality.For lunch, I always go with the egg salad, which is creamy, well-seasoned, and always satiates my craving for egg goodness. \u00a0In the early evening, sometimes I stop by for a beer and appetizer with friends. \u00a0The cheese selection is quite good (you'll find Stilton, Gouda, Manchego, etc.), and the beers are all microbrews (if you're into that kind of thing). \u00a0Dinner selections include fondue, pastas, pizzas, and some specialties, but the prices are on par with more interesting restaurants in downtown Champaign/Urbana.In terms of baked goods, I am quite fond of ordering my sandwiches here with sourdough or rye bread. \u00a0Yum! \u00a0At most places with a baking reputation, I always find myself enticed by the sweet buns and cookies, but I almost never find myself tempted by the ones at The Bread Company. \u00a0Their treats always look colorless and hardened, as if they were made by an angry grandma.Overall, I'd recommend this to people who like simple, light food. \u00a0If you are cheap and don't care about indie street cred, you could probably get the same food at Panera.", 
      "Food was pretty good. Nice ambiance for dinners. I got the hot turkey sandwich that came with some tasty potatoes in the side and a salad. Was a little bit on the pricey side for a sandwich, but I think that if you go during lunch you'll get a better value for money. My friend ended up getting a pasta dish which was pretty decent however like I mentioned it was pretty expensive. Would be nice for a special occasion.", 
      "I've been to The Bread Company several times now, and left disappointed most of those times. Their food isn't horrible or anything (except for their gazpacho, which is by far the worst I've had), but it's definitely overpriced and bland. The only item on their menu that's worth mention is the grilled roast beef sandwich ($9.50 after tax) -- fried roast beef cold cuts, sauteed onions, and gruyere cheese. Just about anything else I've had there, including their soups, was just bland and cost waaaaay more than it should. Also, their pesto tastes nothing like basil, more like parsley puree - I definitely don't recommend getting anything that has it. Finally, you'd think that a restaurant named the Bread Company would have good bread on their sandwiches...", 
      "Three star food with two star prices - not to be confused with the two dollar sign symbols on yelp :p So yes, I mean it's extremely overpricedDecent for an \"special occasion\" and students tend to be impressed with this place just because it's actually a nice sit-down restaurant and not on Green Street, but it needs to get over itself a little if it wants to thrive in Chambana. Fondue is really the only reason to check this place out since I don't know of anything else nearby that has this for dessert, but food is just average. Oh and their sangria is on point, too. But really, what college kid is drinking sangria? If they are, they are probably used to their wine out of a box", 
      "I just had a group event here, and the Bread Company was great! They were really flexible with the menu, and only charged $35 for the private room. Plus, the tip was not added on automatically (which is a pet-peeve of many people I know.)The pizzas were great, thin-crusts. Very unique topping combinations! I have never seen roasted carrots on a pizza before, but it was surprisingly tasty. The best pizza was one with spinach.Also, their salads were awesome! I am pretty fussy about eating salad at restaurants, but these were among the best.The servers were friendly and the manager (Chris?) was especially helpful with making arrangements for the group event. I would recommend this place if you need a private area for your group!", 
      "Boyfriend and I went here for a date night. We enjoyed our time together, the food, and the music selection. The atmosphere is sort of country southern french meets Italian restaurant dining. We ordered the bruschetta, a pizza, and the filet mignon. Everything was very good and flavorful. I especially loved the filet mignon - the seasoning was so delicious and the meat was tender and cooked pefectly. \u00a0Overall: nice ambiance and good service. Food was delicious but a little overpriced.", 
      "The Bread Company is a restaurant with many different faces. By day they have a varieties of soups and sandwiches, as well as baked goods. Sandwiches are on luscious slices of thick bread and the soups come with crunchy salads. I especially like the grilled sandwiches, which are laced with creamy butter and lightly browned meat. Portions are quite large and one sandwich could probably be shared easily among two adults. Sometimes I forget this and end up making two meals out of one sandwich.During lunch hours this place is quite crowded, but by late afternoon it becomes serene. Soft green light floods in from the skylight and during the winter you can sit the fire with a baguette and a glass of wine. \u00a0As regards to the review that mentioned rudeness about adding protein to things, I've heard that happen many times during lunch and now they let you have your meat, but charge a lot for it. They have this bizarre policy because they \"don't want people making their own sandwiches with the bread that comes with the entree.\" Nice one. At night it becomes more formal, with candlelight, fondue, and more upscale entrees. The balsamic potatoes that come with the entrees are perfect. I like the fondue, but it's a little too much for me...even the small pot can be shared by two. Last time I was there I tried the tapas and the yellowfin tuna and the lamb were delicious, but I was less than enthusiastic about the duck mousse, which had a bland sickly sweet flavor. The greens that came with the tapas were also pretty inexcusable. When I go to a good restaurant I expect more than just some shredded romaine, especially when field greens are still in season. The new small desserts are also not so great. The chocolate mousse was good, but the bread pudding was just some bread soaked in eggs and sugar.", 
      "My husband and I, along with two other couples, decided to celebrate the end of the semester tonight by going out. \u00a0After *much* debate, we ended up at The Bread Company. \u00a0As a former music major, this was one of my usual haunts, but the rest of them hadn' t been there quite as frequently. \u00a0(Lunch, by the way, is excellent; they have excellent sandwiches and salads).The specialty, of course, is the fondue, which is magnifique. \u00a0My only gripe is that portion sizes tend to vary widely from time to time, as does the selection of vegetables that comes with your meal. \u00a0The combination of cheeses, though, is great, and the bread and potatoes are wonderful.Tonight, though, I had one of their specials, which was good, but was actually my *third* choice of menu items. \u00a0They were out of the fettucine with salmon AND out of the chicken pizza. \u00a0Now, I don't pretend to understand the inner workings of the restaurant business, but it really irritates me when they run out of something. \u00a0To me, that just smacks of poor planning. \u00a0Do they not have a kitchen? \u00a0Can they not make more? \u00a0If not, then can they not provide accurate estimates of how much of each food item to make, so they won't run out? \u00a0I don't know, but it just seems like when you go someplace, you should be able to look at the menu with confidence.Anyway, the beef fondue I had was very good, and one of my dinner companions adored her trout. \u00a0She said it was the most moist fish she had eaten in quite some time, and she is a fish lover. \u00a0Her husband, a reasonably picky eater, devoured his pancetta pizza with no complaints, as did another friend with his salmon. \u00a0I thought the portion sizes of some of the meals were pretty small, especially given the price. \u00a0Still, it's good food, and worth the money, especially when you consider it's not that expensive. \u00a0Service was pretty good, although a little slow, particularly since they weren't that busy tonight. \u00a0My guess is she just had a hard day.We love the Bread Company and will continue to visit, but probably just for the fondue. \u00a0We know they'll have it, and we know it's good. \u00a0Thanks for a fun evening!", 
      "I've been to the Bread Company at least 6 times over the past three years all separated by months. The only reason I continue to go back has got to be because I forget about how sub-standard their food is. And today I decided to finally put my disappointment on the internet.This review was spurred by a visit today to get coffee and a pastry. I ordered an americano that was obviously made with poor quality espresso, and perhaps by someone with little knowledge of what an americano should be. It was too watery, but maybe that is my taste. I also had what they dared to call a chocolate croissant. It could have been made days ago. Instead of being light and fluffy, it was dense and doughy and filled with chocolate chips that were never fully melted so they maintained their chip structure. I was less than impressed. But this seems to be the way things go at the Bread Company.As I mentioned earlier, I have been going to the Bread Company for quite a few years (having been at the U of I as a student since 2008), and their menu has yet to change. At all. This sort of stagnancy is worrisome and really speaks to the lack of effort that the chef and/or owner put into this business.On a recent dinner visit I got the chocolate fondue which came with possibly pre-made cinnamon bread slices, strawberries, and a plethora of apples and pears. I suppose the apples and pears were in season (it was November when I went), but I don't see how apples work with chocolate. I've had their pizza many times, and I cannot deny that they do a good crust...but I just don't get the pizza that comes with a mountain of salad on top. It is just too much and overwhelms the pizza that really should be the star of the dish.Overall the Bread Company is uninspired and very tired. This is reflected in their dusty, unchanging interior, their menus, and the often impolite, lackluster performances of the staff.", 
      "I ate dinner at The Bread Company for the first time last night prior to attending a play at the Krannert Center. \u00a0I had read many reviews of the restaurant and entered with some trepidation. \u00a0My party had a reservation for ten people at 6:00pm and I was in the last group to arrive - a little late. The other guests were already enjoying a drink while waiting.The service and food were both outstanding. Our server, Nick, was prompt, polite, and knowledgeable. \u00a0Everyone's food looked so good. I ordered a vegan pasta dish with vegetables, which was excellent. \u00a0My wife had one of the unique pizzas and enjoyed it thoroughly. I noticed that at the end of dinner all in our party had left nothing on their plates. \u00a0We were all full happy campers! Only one member ordered dessert - chocolate mousse. He said it was great.We were finished with a leisurely dinner and had our bill paid with more than enough time to stroll down the block to see our play. The only negatives were bread that was a bit burnt due to what appeared to be a hot spot in the oven and the meals which were delivered to the table one or two at a time, which seemed a bit odd. However, the overall experience was enjoyed by everyone, making for an excellent prelude to the play. I will definitely come here again.", 
      "Bread Company has a selection of great ingredients that results in good food, but the service is terribly inconsistent. I have a bunch of stories about this, but here's the two that contrast most significantly: (1) When I came for afternoon drinks with my writing group, it was quiet and we received great, not-too-hands-on service: a nice mixture of noticing when we might want more drinks and letting us alone.(2) A few weeks ago, my husband and I went with a party of 6 for dinner 1 1/2 hours before a show, told them our schedule, and were assured that we should have plenty of time. Cool -- except that the whole thing turned out to be kind of a disaster. We all ordered at the same time, and there seemed to be plenty of servers for a full room at dinner, but our meals arrived over the course of a half-hour (the pasta came after the steak, hmm). Fresh and tasty dinners, yes, but it was impossible to wait and eat together, and everyone was antsy due to the delays. In the end, we finished 20 minutes after our preferred time and our waitress did not seem particularly motivated to help the situation along or even really apologize.So: Good food, decent wine, but the service is a gamble. Try it, but go on a quiet weeknight -- definitely not for a Krannert opening or right before another occasion.", 
      "Super romantic spot on a cold winter night. The fondue is excellent. Staff is intelligent and attentive. The crowd is the highly educated, super liberal type. Refreshing sometimes.", 
      "Fondue dinner at the Bread Company is probably the top restaurant experience I miss from Urbana, IL (caveat: this review is a bit out of date). At the time you could get a very decent swiss cheese fondue with good bread, some roasted garlic for an appetizer, and two glasses of house red for just over $30--a princely sum for a starving college student, but compared with the trendy $100 fondue restaurants in the SF Bay Area, a steal. The dinnertime atmosphere was also great: quiet, romantic, dimly but warmly lit.They also had fantastic checkerboard shortbread cookies. I've been hard pressed to find better anywhere else.Lunch sandwiches and other baked goods were both decent, but the five stars are for the fondue date memories.", 
      "When I went to school at U of I, I came here all the time during lunch to grab a roast beef or ham sandwich on their freshly baked swiss bread. Sometimes I went for the half soup/half sandwich, or half salad/half sandwich to get more variety in my diet. The food here is like comfort food for me, since I grew up in Urbana and my mother used to buy these sandwiches and their large loaves of freshly baked Z\u00fcpfe for my brothers and me. The service at The Bread Company has always been fast and efficient, and the employees were always very cool and made no mistakes taking my order and making me a really good sandwich. I've been here a few times for dinner with my friends. The atmosphere totally changes in the evening for dinner, as they lay out white tablecloths, dim the lights and allow the romantic glow of candles set the mood. Their pizza is delicious and filling, and their tapas come in pretty big portions. This is a cute and cozy place for anyone on a date or double date, or out to celebrate a special occasion.I've ordered take out from them a few times when I've had last minute dinner party pot lucks to attend and didn't have time to cook. One time, I picked up a strawberry walnut mixed green salad, which was perfect, and also a french baguette with a side of baked garlic bulbs drizzled with olive oil. It was worth every dollar.I love this place!", 
      "If all of the profs on campus hide out in a certain place, you know it has to be good. \u00a0I always hear mixed reviews about this place from my friends, but I'm going to go ahead and give it a 4. \u00a0This is my new favorite lunch place on campus (for when you have time). \u00a0The sandwiches may be $1-2 more but are killer compared to other on-campus options. \u00a0The grilled sandwiches may be a little buttery on the crust for some, but it's perfect for me. \u00a0Last time that I went I got the grilled turkey sandwich which comes with caramelized onions and cheese.Dinner options include fondue and pretty good pizza. \u00a0They also have some good bottles of wine on the list, I've ordered a bottle twice and been happy with what I got. \u00a0You might have to talk to one of the chefs if you want wine opinions since our server didn't seem to know much.Really good atmosphere and decor, it's casual/fancy enough for pretty much anything, and it's right next to Krannert if you need an after-show dinner.", 
      "Food is very solid. Although many other reviews have had a problem with service. I have been there dozens of times for lunch and dinner and never been disappointed. It's a family type place so don't expect the service to be like that in a chain restaurant.If you want solid food with a continental flair can't go wrong here", 
      "The bread co is owned by a Swiss family, their children own Cafe Luna in Champaign, also worth a visit. I love coming here to relax and talk with my mom when we make lunch dates. I celebrated special occasions here as well growing up. They sure knew how to accommodate a large group of 14 year old girls on my birthday years ago!Recommendations-Roast beef sandwich-Portabella, brie, and raspberry jam sandwich-Z\u00fcpfe bread, it's comparable to challah bread.-Cheese fondue - beautiful beautiful gruyere fondue. As good as Switzerland-Meat fondue - the broth is lovely, it's served with three different sauces and fresh baguette.-Chocolate fondue - Melted swiss chocolate, fresh fruit in season, cookies, pound cake.I love this place. It is one of my favorites.", 
      "Every time I've been here, the food has been fine. But I don't come here often. It's not that I'm not on campus, or don't like the food (see the first sentence.) Spouse and I tend to avoid The Bread Company because it's almost always dirty and the service is wildly inconsistent. Tables aren't bussed, there is dust on the paintings, trays of dirty glasses sit out, the walls aren't cleaned. Heck, the pizza/empanada place around the corner is often cleaner than The Bread Company. Sometimes the wait staff is really nice. Sometimes they are brats. Devil or angel, they rarely know what they are doing. Want more coffee? The nice waiter will forget; the brat glare at you. Either way, you don't get the coffee. For a long time, The Bread Company was one of a handful of restaurants that served decent food in C-U. Even after C-U got more restaurants, there still was a long period of time when there was no other decent restaurant in the area. The result seems to be that the Bread Company has gotten used to figuring it has a captive audience and so does not have to work for customers. That attitude seems to permeate everything it does. The trouble is that the food isn't worth the attitude, at least not to spouse and I.I wish The Bread Company was a more pleasant, better run restaurant.", 
      "The Bread Company is one of my favorite restaurants, and is one of the things I miss most about U of I. \u00a0I ate here frequently as a student and as an alumna I make sure to stop in every time I return to campus. \u00a0The atmosphere of the restaurant makes me feel like I'm taken away from the stress of every day life. \u00a0They have a fireplace in the corner and white lights strung up to make it feel romantic, but it is modernized with the art that they have on the walls. \u00a0My husband and I usually share an order of cheese fondue and a gourmet pizza. \u00a0The Bread Company offers a nice selection of wine and beer, including wine by the carafe. \u00a0I can't forget to mention their selection of fresh baked cookies. \u00a0The sables and chocolate macaroons are delicious. \u00a0Great atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable prices - I love this place!", 
      "Wow. I wouldn't be surprised if this became one of my favorite lunch spots on campus. I went today and really liked it. I got one of their grilled sandwiches: turkey pesto, and it came with gruyere cheese and grilled red onions... delicious. It's not extremely cheap: I paid around $7.50 (but the cold sandwiches go for $5.50 or so), so there definitely are cheaper options to eat around there, but the food is good so it's worth it in my opinion. On top of that, I like the place and the atmosphere. They also sell bread (as you might guess!), and have wine by the glass. I can't wait to check it out for dinner.", 
      "Look, I'm not fussy. I'm not mean. \u00a0I'm not demanding. \u00a0I just want a glass of wine and some food. \u00a0I'm even willing to just order off the board when the waitress can't figure out that four people need more than one menu. I really wish I could discuss the food, but the service is so bad that I can't remember what I had to eat. \u00a0In case the staff reads yelp in between listening to the Smiths all day and wondering why they aren't famous artists yet, here are some tips:1. \u00a0Bring menus for everyone2. \u00a0Do not walk away if only three people have ordered and there are four people at the table.3. Do not roll your eyes, kid. 4. Do not pretend that you are a really good waitress who can remember everything. \u00a0You have to write it down because when you don't write it down you will end up bringing me the wrong thing. \u00a05. \u00a0Do not forget to take empty plates off the rickety, unclean table because otherwise there is nowhere to put down the food. It's ok the first time you bring it because the order is wrong and you have to take it back. \u00a0(See number 3) 6. \u00a0Do not let our wine glasses get empty. We live in the midwest too. We hate it here too. We need more wine."

      "You have to try the Jalape\u00f1o burger I think it's called the flame thrower ... oh man its so good! \u00a0Ask for a cup of their BBq and some fries and you're in heaven! With it being in campus the atmosphere can dip from time to time because you get loaded with soke obnoxious college students, but over all a very enjoyable experience and good food", 
      "Super solid bar food. Fries are great, ingredients are all solid, pretzel bun is !!!, and the burgers were juicy. Great bar atmosphere and it's in a beautiful building. I've been twice and I'll be going back. Enjoyable experiences both times.", 
      "My husband I just left the Firehaus and we were very pleased with the service of our bartender. She was very helpful, friendly and had great customer service. In our time at the Firehaus, we observed an incompetent management team. While the bartenders became busy trying to fill orders for their servers you could see patrons at the bar with empty glasses including ourselves. \u00a0Management was sitting at the end of the bar sipping on their sodas and barking orders at employees. At no time did the manager \u00a0attempt to help the bartenders and clear their backlog. As we were getting ready to leave we observed a member of the management team chewing out a member of the waitstaff to where she was in tears. This was done in front of a very crowded bar for all patrons to observe. Personally, I think this is a horrible time (middle of a shift) and place (in front of a crowded bar) for a reprimand to occur. \u00a0 I think their management team is extremely unprofessional and feel for the employees under their leadership.", 
      "Sunday wings! 10 grilled wings for $4.99 - very worth it. I ordered 20 but I could only finish 11.", 
      "Two words - GREAT SERVICE. Came here for lunch on a Saturday with a buddy. I ordered the Royal Burger - fried egg and bacon on a pretzel roll. The patty was homemade and delicious. However. the rolls - the pretzel roll was ...meh. Not the soft chewy consistency I expected. Based purely on food alone - I give this place 3-stars - it's average. However, it deserves an extra star for its service. For the first time (in a LONG time) I was pleasantly surprised by the attentiveness, cheerfulness, and friendliness of the restaurant staff. Emma, our server, had such a great personality!", 
      "Though all four years of being. A student here, this was my first time dining at this bar. Seeing this location not as bar for once. the set up is a lot cleaner and awesome than meets the eye. It's just like a typical sports bars with TVs everywhere following all kind of sports. Now what really attracted me today was it's deal! For $4.99 you can get 10 delicious wings that matches that if Buffalo Wild Wings! Of course, the deals do Cary day to day so you may just have to swing by the place very now and them to see if the daily special flows your boat. But when it does, boy is it worth it!The waitresses are extremely fast to react and the food also comes with speed. Their bottles and draft selection are humongous, and their prices are pretty decent too! Definitely checkout the place!", 
      "Foods great, dance floor is severely lacking. They were like \"there is no dance floor here sir, please do not do this or we'll ask you to leave\" so I had to bring the party to everyone else in the bar. Didn't even finger bang anyone. Completely ruined my evening, worst campus bar for sure.", 
      "Disclaimer: review is for their food & service, not for the nightlife.Oh Firehaus, what have they done to you since the Class of 2012 graduated and left?Maybe this place was always a little sub-par and I didn't notice or care because I was too busy drinking for free, but I swear it has gone downhill in the past couple years.This used to be my regular spot. I'd eat here probably once a week if not more and switch off between wings, salad, chicken tenders, or spinach artichoke dip. It was all amazing, every time.But sadly, my old stomping grounds have become disappointing.I came here back in May for a random visit and saw they added an AMAZING sandwich to the menu, the Southwest Chicken. Grilled chicken, provolone, pepper and onions, and avocado? YUM. Paired with onion rings and I knew this would be my new go-to on their menu.Flash forward to a couple weeks ago when I came down for Homecoming. My friends and I literally parked the car in a garage a block away and went straight to Firehaus. Ah, the nostalgia! The memories! THE GOOD FOOD!I ordered the Southwest Chicken with a side of onion rings, like I had been dreaming about all day. When it came out I was immediately disappointed to see they had replaced the fresh avocado slices with some sort of avocado PASTE. Yuck! It smelled and tasted bizarre so I scraped it off. Bye, delicious chicken sandwich! Now you are merely of slightly-above-average taste.The next day I came in for lunch, because who actually goes to Illini football games anymore? I decided to get a side salad and wings, and everyone at the table ordered a drink with their food. The waitress brought out everyone's drinks except mine, which I found strange since I had just ordered a bottle of Bud Light Platinum. After another server brought out everyone's food and not mine, I flagged down our server and the look on her face when I asked about my food was one of, \"Oh shit.\" So she ran away and came back a couple minutes later explaining she forgot to put in my order originally. Well, duh, I kind of got that. She apologized profusely and said I'd get a discount on my bill.The wings were worth the wait, honestly, and the salad was as good as I remembered. But then the part where my bill came? No discount. At this point we were rushing off to go to another bar and my friend was nice enough to just pay for my tab, but come on. If you're going to screw up my order and then promise a discount, deliver on it.Maybe I'm just picky, or maybe I expected more from a place I used to frequent. Or maybe it lost its shine. It pains me, Firehaus, but you only get 3 stars from me.", 
      "In today's paper, it says this place got a failing health dept. inspection.", 
      "I dunno if it was just me and my spiritual ora while in Firehaus, but I always got hit on by a random girl on the weekends here. I felt kind of bad because I was already in a very committed relationship aka married. But really, I wasn't sending misleading creepy signals or being charming either. For the longest time I thought it was the smell of my hair wax I was using to style my bed hair when I would go out to socialize with friends. But I tested this theory numerous times in other cities and no dice. Yes, the wife was not with me at other venues.Investigatively (not a real word)... I think on certain weekends, the local gals come here to find their knight and shining armor to take them away from the small town. But here is the thing, u will never know if she is a local until she tells you. But I came here enough to observe and identify how to spot these rare and undiscovered people. First off, they are extremely beautiful, like the tone of their skin was almost natural and organic... unmanipulated by the city or fake UV rays. They dress differently, no labels and no blig. And here is the kicker, they talk differently. Their topics of discussion are not layered from the dry vocabulary of the bullshit literary material University students are being brain washed in (this includes myself). One big clue seemed to be the type of questions they asked. University girls typically asked questions like what are you studying, where have you interned, what year in school are you? But I noticed the local asked a key differentiating question: where are you originally from?---if you decode this question, it's underlying motive is can you take her away from her boring hometown.Keep in mind, this place is not swarming with these type of treasures. A treasure is a treasure to be found. I write this review because I hope to read or hear about somebody finding their future other half at Firehaus. A smart city kid that swoops a small town gal off her feet and make a ton of babies after graduating.So best wishes to you bachelors, go to Firehaus with new purpose. Cheers! I'll be expecting a wedding invitation shortly. LOL...", 
      "The Backdraft Burger at Firehaus is a campus favorite that is served with some of the best fries I've ever eaten (upgrade them to the Haus Fries and they are the best fries I've ever eaten). The Backdraft is a quarter-pound of ground chuck, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion. I opted to add bacon to my burger and top it with BBQ sauce. I also subbed the house bun for a pretzel bun to kick this burger up a notch. The result is a mouthwatering combination of sauce, meat, cheese, and bun that is first-rate. If the beef was only a little more flavorful and juicy this campustown burger would be amongst some of the better I've had. Firehaus gets major points for being a campus bar that sports some gourmet grub, great drinks, and a fun atmosphere. If you're ever in home of the Illini Firehaus is a must.", 
      "Oh Firehaus. I really wish you were better, but with your normally absentminded waitresses and bartenders who on weekend nights are stuck up, how can I, really? \u00a0I think that you're tolerable on Mondays, when I can kind of hear myself think, the bartenders are the new ones and not completely jaded, and I can drink cuervo silver margaritas for $3.But Firehaus, my experience with you is generally bad. \u00a0The lines are ridiculous, the music is overwhelmingly loud, my friend's credit card got closed out to the wrong person, and had someone else's drinks on it... and his last name is not \"Smith\" or \"Jones\" or anything common. \u00a0What You did to get on my last nerve? \u00a0Once I was there, and a seasoned bartender dipped a glass in the ice bin, and it came up broken.... which means there was glass in the ice bin. \u00a0I pointed it out, and so he got another glass... and dipped it back in the same ice bin with glass in it. Gross. \u00a0Their food is OK, but overrated. Bah. Firehaus, I will definitely not miss you when I move away.", 
      "I love how they open up the windows when it gets warm enough and have a beer garden up top. \u00a0They have good daily drink specials (Sharkbowls on Tuesdays!) and is kept very clean - and I don't just mean by campus bar standards! \u00a0During the day, it's also nice to sit by the open windows and grab some chow - just your typical bar food - but it can get pretty busy, especially for lunch.I remember getting a Sharkbowl for the first time on a barcrawl with co-workers: \"Uh oh, these are really yummy\" =P \u00a0Needless to say, the fact that Firehaus was only the second stop on our list made sure that the rest of the night was comprised of a bunch of drunken debauchery.", 
      "I'm a little too young to remember this place as R&R's, and I had stopped working here by the time they brought the shark bowl back, but I was one of the first employees of this place when it reopened (FINALLY) as \"Firehaus\" in '05.This bar took a long time to get on its feet, and by then, I was tired of not making any money due to lack of clientle, so I had moved on. But now, it's kicking ass and taking names and has a whole lot of loyal customers, and for that, I give this bar all sorts of props.Also, I just said \"props.\" Ew.Anyway, the really excellent thing about this bar is that it is CLEAN. Clean clean clean. Even on Unofficial, which is arguably the dirtiest day on campus all year, the bathrooms at Firehaus will be clean. The layout isn't my favorite as there aren't a whole lot of places to sit, but the beer garden is excellent, and the buffalo chicken sandwich (with pasta salad!) was pretty damned good.Of all the Cochrane bars on campus, this one is without a doubt. the best.", 
      "Great for kickin' it and watching a hockey game with your friends. This place is sprawling, with an upstairs, another upstairs, and a patio outside. I went during the summer when it was full but not crowded. The service was blas\u00e9 but available.", 
      "I am rating the food. \u00a0(Not the bar).Let's say, I take a thin ground beef patty and take a mallet, and pound the crap out of it--so that it's shape isn't even round any more. \u00a0That is their Backdraft Burger. \u00a0Don't even try to order a medium rare one. They are all cooked the same like a fast food joint. \u00a0Was disappointed with their burger.As far as the bar environment I would give that three stars.", 
      "It is really hard to review a bar from your college town. \u00a0The nostalgia factor gets in the way of objectivity! \u00a0I've always liked Firehaus but it was never one of my haunts. \u00a0I like how they have large tables, and how the front is open-air. \u00a0They have lots of daily drink specials, and the atmosphere isn't sketchy. \u00a0Dim lighting, very red in there. \u00a0Well I guess it is a firehouse. \u00a0Despite it \"looking\" nicer than some other campus bars (it's really just that it's newer, I'm sure), you are still going to run into some silly silly people. \u00a0Last time we were here, a drunk guy was talking to us and wouldn't leave, so we took his flip flops and hid them in the girls bathroom. \u00a0So you know, it's not a total class act of a bar, but it's pretty clean and well-maintaned compared to some of the other options.", 
      "I remember a time when this place was called R&R's and there was the legendary Sharkbowl. \u00a0This place got a face lift and now it's called Firehaus.Now they've replaced it with the fishbowl which is a much smaller fruitier version of the sharkbowl. \u00a0Oh well. \u00a0There isn't much room for dancing.. but I like how there is no cover for 21+. \u00a0It also is a college scene but it's one redeemable aspect is that the people are pretty good looking.", 
      "The food at Firehaus is pretty excellent. \u00a0I love that you can get the burgers on pretzel buns, and the Firehaus fries are the greatest thing ever! \u00a0I've never had trouble with the service either. \u00a0One time, I was given the employee discount because the waitress \"kept forgetting about us,\" but if she did, I certainly never noticed. \u00a0I do wish the kitchen was open later, though. \u00a0 The Firehaus fries are $3.99 on Fridays, but even though the kitchen is supposed to close at 10, if I get there past 9:30, it's already too late.I don't have too much experience with the nightlife here, but it seems pretty crowded when I go to get my fries. \u00a0Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you, but it was kind of a pain that I couldn't hear any of my friends from across the table. \u00a0I've been there a few times earlier in the week when it's less crowded, and it's been pretty enjoyable.Last word of advice: \u00a0avoid the amaretto stone sours. \u00a0Unless the person making mine messed something up, it just wasn't good. \u00a0It was bland and syrupy,", 
      "Hmmm firehaus was nice on the inside, air conditioned, clean for a bar, espec. a campus bar. \u00a0My dining partner and I thought the firefighter photography on the wall was on the depressing side, but at least it fit the motif. \u00a0Our waitress was competant, and left us alone to conduct our business.My sandwhich was $7 though, and I still had to pay extra for fries. \u00a0Not crazy about that.", 
      "I am soooo torn in writing this review right now!So let's break it down into two visits, one nightlife related, one evening food related.Nightlife:I came here for a friend's 21st and waited for an hour until 145 a.m. (yes, 15 min. before close) when I just said f**k it and left with my friends. Honestly, what is the point of maintaining the line that close to closing when the bar itself is not at capacity??Evening:We came here at the end of Fall semester as an organization to celebrate a job well done. Our group of 10 was seated promptly and the waitress did an awesome job in accommodating our group. We came on a Thursday I think which meant $3 burger with AMAZINGGGGGG fries. Their fries are double fried so they have a great crispy crust. On top of that, they have a good selection of beer on tap to complement your meal. Expect to pay more for a pint than for your entire meal haha.So it's quite bittersweet... awesome bar food place turned horrible bar at night? This is life :(", 
      "So from my experiences, this is one of the better campus establishments. Take note this is for Firehaus as a restaurant only.Service can be \"awkward\" at times to say the least. You seat yourself and I feel sometimes it van take awhile to be recognized. I like to go mention something to the bartender just so they know I am looking to get something to eat.Thursdays they have half price appetizers earlier in the evening which isn't to bad.The best thing here is the fries - more crunchy than soggy. Burgers are not as good as some of the other campus bar establishments. The thing I do like about the burgers is the pretzel buns - something unique which I appreciate.Overall for food, not to shabby.", 
      "I think this place is totally overrated. The food is very basic and \"so so\" at best and overpriced for what you get. The location is very good, particularly if you're a student but this is not a place I would recommend. I'm also surprised at how few food and drink specials they offer.", 
      "Went here as a stop while crawling along UofI. I think it's a cute place, I like the interior design. Nice bathrooms, decent drinks. Laid-back atmosphere...a huge step up from Kam's!", 
      "I remember the Wednesday nights I spent here with a paint-pen decorated mug in my hand or clutching one of the many straws poking out of a Shark Bowl. \u00a0Of course it was R&R's back then...After being under construction for something like 17 years, it finally re-opened after I moved to Chicago. \u00a0I came here before a football game last year and was pretty impressed. \u00a0Out with the rickety wooden stairs and graffiti-filled bathroom. \u00a0In with the shiny photos of firefighters and giant hydrants of beer. \u00a03 cheers for hydrants of beer!! \u00a0The decor was crisp and basic, which is appropriate for a campus bar where drunken kleptomaniacs will nab anything that isn't nailed down. \u00a0Apparently, you must be 21 to enter after 9pm so they are going for an older crowd. \u00a0I highly recommend this place if you're an alum and hitting up Chambana for a sporting event.", 
      "Came here to grab a bite with friends. Their cheeseburger and chips deal on Tuesdays is awesome and it's only $2.99 so it's super affordable for broke college students!! Will be back soon.", 
      "Sadly, not named after the 80's hair-band, nonetheless, the former R&R's has been cleaned up and they provide some pretty good pub fare. \u00a0The wings are quite good. \u00a0Also, I must say I was impressed with the level of service I received for Sunday brunch, after a football Saturday. \u00a0If our wait person was hung-over she sure didn't show it. \u00a0On time with refills and completely polite. \u00a0Best part, 6 people for lunch: $50.", 
      "This place opened my last year of college and I really liked it because it was a 21 and up bar. \u00a0While I didn't go to Illinois, I spent many a weekend partying down there. \u00a0We loved the somewhat clean feel to Firehaus and the cheap drinks. \u00a0I went back this weekend for my brothers graduation and it is now an absolute madhouse on the weekends. \u00a0It's still a pretty solid place, but it has become more of your typical Champaign bar.", 
      "We just hosted a party at Firehaus for our triplet's 21st birthday which was held on the 2nd floor. \u00a0The bar service was outstanding and the food (italian beef; chicken quesadillas; chicken tenders; veggie platter; pretzel dip) was delicious! The Firehaus staff was very accommodating and even took care of taking down the decorations at the end of the party. I highly recommend the Firehaus for a party!", 
      "I am writing strictly about a lunch experience. The service was a bit mediocre, but the place has a bright and interesting atmosphere. The honey turkey wrap was delicious, and the portions were quite filling.", 
      "Good burgers, good fries. good place for large groups since you can get a large table in the open air section and enjoy nice weather and be loud, but overall, it scores average for champaign. Decent atmosphere, decent food, decent service. I couldn't find much to not like, but not much to rave about.", 
      "This place never fails me for a good time. I would say when I'm in Chambana 70% of the year, this is my default location. You can find me here for lunch dates with my bff for their fried chicken salad with blue cheese and a side of their homemade fries... mmm so delicious! Recently they have introduced $4 40's... which I pray they will continue through the school year, not just the summer! The balcony is always nice on a summer evening. Of course this place gets packed... what campus bar doesn't? But if I had to pick a bar to wait in line for, it'd be this one.", 
      "Meh, typical college bar. Maybe I'm getting old and this would have suited me when I was in college, but I can't see anything that would make me choose this over any other place, like Murphy's.", 
      "This place is ok, but what I miss the most is what used to be here: my beloved R and R's....Wednesday night mug nights with $2 HUGE mugs of bud, bud light or cider beer...it was dirty and crowded and hot, but played GREAT 80s hair band music (and even music from 80s movies like the Karate Kid...how awesome is that?)..ok, back to reality...Firehaus is pretty because it's newer and the food is pretty standard bar fare, but nothing spectacular. \u00a0 The decor is nice and eye-catching though. I will go when I'm in town just to reminisce about it's predecessor and those addictive shark bowls with the plastic squeaky shark...ok, now I'm just rambling, sorry!", 
      "It's okay barfood for Campustown. The Haus Fries are amazing, the burgers are underwhelming, the booze is expensive for the serving size (almost $5 for a weak vodka cranberry... really?) Plus it gets loud at night. I think if I were an undergrad at U of I, I'd like the place, but seeing as I'm an old graduate student, I'm unimpressed.", 
      "Been here once for lunch, once for dinner, and once late night. Honestly, the crowds were biggest during lunch, definitely unusual for a campus bar. The food was okay, typical bar food, but Legend's is better. 2 stars for the food, drink, and party atmosphere, 4 stars for the fact that it is CLEAN, pretty, and well decorated, so a 3 over all.", 
      "Good daily specials! \u00a0 I feel like this place is just a typical sports bar on campus -- a dime a dozen. I'm starting to get used to the super cheap alcohol in Champaign, that the specials here only get one star. This place isnt that special...besides the fact that it's oh-so-close to my building. The waitress was slow, literally and mentally. She took forever AND \u00a0messed up our bill. I guess she's forgiven because she's cute, but geez!", 
      "I've been here a few times. I remember coming a few years ago to watch some NBA game, and then more recently as a random stop with a few new friends. I feel like it was night and day for me. The service was terrible, and I am a stickler for good service. The kicker: it wasn't even all that busy! Food is standard bar food, the drinks are alright, I just hate having to track down people to get a simple order of a few beers. I'd hate to see what it looks like when it's really busy.", 
      "For Champaign, this is one of the better places. \u00a0It has some of the best bar food in campus town and some of the specials are decent. \u00a0For example, Fridays they have $4 forties and $4 Firehaus fries which are spectacular. \u00a0It's one of my favorite bars in Champaign."

      "I don't understand how people can come here and only order one thing.I loveee getting their bulgogi and seafood soondooboo!SO GOOD. I can never find anywhere that has better bugogi than here. I think it's because they actually use a grill for the meat. AMAZING.On top of that, the owner is SO nice. Always has a smile and is asking how my day is.Can't go wrong with this place :)", 
      "I was finally able to give this place a shot today and I was very disappointed. Prior to eating here, I knew from other reviews that the service wasn't the best, but I wanted to go to the restraunt without letting this info skew my opinion. However, I got there and received some of the worst service I've ever gotten. Right off the bat, the young man at the counter was not welcoming at all - it seemed like he didn't want to be working. I asked him if there were any sections for lunch specials in the menu because I saw \"lunch special!\" written on one of the laminated pictures, and he rudely replied with \"no lunch specials.\" Okay then...I paid with my debit card and they do it with an iPad, making you pay tip while they're pointing the iPad at you, which I thought was a bit rude. I gave 15% but I shouldn't have because this guy was extremely rude and they don't serve you at all. It's all self service. Also, I asked for no onions in general for my tofu soup, but when I received my food, there were green onions on top. So I said I had asked for no onions and the guy that took my order first gave me attitude saying \"that's not onions, you didnt tell me no green onions, you just said onions.\" And I replied with, \"they're still onions... I said no onions, I thought that was very clear.\" And he replied with \"you need to specify what you want.\" And I just shrugged it off and was already annoyed with him at this point where I just took the food because I didn't want anymore trouble, and the woman who gave me my food asked the guy as I was leaving if I had an onion allergy where he replied to her saying I had none, I just didn't like them. This was so rude because he doesn't know me (what if I did have allergies) nor was it necessary for him to make it my fault that I didn't specify what kind of onions I didn't want, when I didn't know there were two different types of onions in the soup. So needless to say, I probably won't be returning to the restraunt unless I'm having a huge craving for their mediocre korean food.", 
      "So you saw all the pictures people posted right? Looks good right? Mmm U can taste it already in your mouth...the hot spicey tofu soup, the bulgogi lunch combo...mmmmI saw small little teeth marks on my kimchee that most likely was from a rat getting into the tub of kimchee in the back kitchen somewhere. These marks were not a half eaten kimchee cube from a human. I know what a half eaten kimchee cube looks like from a human. This was a pest.I spit my food out. Got up and left. Didn't even bother reracking the food tray.Never came back during my two year prison sentence in grad school.", 
      "I was really disappointed. Went in there, got my ramen and was enjoying the first 2 bites until I saw a RAW EGG IN THERE and the egg white was still clear (I don't know about other people, but I don't ever eat eggs raw....)! Told someone about my issue and they simply took my bowl, cooked the ramen again, didn't even bother to get a clean bowl, splashed the ramen in there (the soup got all over the outside of the bowl) and took it back to me. Nothing looked appealing about my food...", 
      "Above average Korean food on the salty/spicy side. I guess everybody has a different experience, but I always thought that the service was pretty decent. The owner asks me how I'm doing in school and etc... Even though I've only seem him a few times.", 
      "i was craving for some cold noodle today (its a hot summer day!) so here i am. The noodle was okay, not enough sauce so its a little bit on the bland side. On the menu the description says it include beef and sashimi, but as you can see on the picture i took, there is no such ingredient! (okay i dont care about sashimi cuz im not too much a seafood person, but where the hell is my beef?!) for almost 10 bucks before tax i got a bunch of steam noodle, a sad little pouched egg and some pickled radish?..... maybe not again...", 
      "S/O to any vegetarians/vegans reading this: WARNING, this is where the very concept of vegetarianism/veganism goes to die. At Goodfellas, the Korean ah-joo-mah simply gives you that standard, condescending \"uggggh\" glare and reluctantly brings out a meatless dish that they probably spat in. That's what I'm more accustomed to when eating at Korean restaurants. Is THAT too much to ask? Here, the muscly bro that works the kitchen just flat out says \"No. Bibim bap needs beef.\" Whatever BRO. Have fun busing trays from your dive cafeteria beef factory, beefy McGee. I can't say what the rest of the non-veggie items are like. \u00a0A friend who went there with me was \"unimpressed.\" TWO STARS FOR YOU.", 
      "It's above average Korean food served at a fast pace and right off Green St. What else more do you want, you ungrateful children?", 
      "Other reviewers have described Woori Jib as a \"hole in the wall.\" It definitely is. The place is functional; it caters to the lunchtime campus crowd. The food isn't cheap (around $10-12 for an average lunch), but the place fills up. Most meals include a second bowl of rice for free and a side of kimchi (radish and cabbage style), which is good. The food is not elegant or fancy -- it is tasty, basic, and homestyle. To me, this is comfort food, the kind you might make yourself at home if you had the time (and tended toward Korean comforts). The beef bulgogi comes out sizzling, with thin sliced and seared white onions. It has been marinated in a sweet soy sauce and this sweetness caramelizes nicely upon grilling. The portion is big and filling.The manduguk has a chicken broth base, and includes loads of mild beef dumplings. As is traditional onions, scallions, and eggs flavor the broth with a little dash of dried kelp on top.The dolsot bibimbap is yummy. The meat was not marinated beef in strips, as I've had in the past, but ground beef (that was just okay). The mixed, steamed veggies and the chili paste with fried egg on top were delicious mixed with the crisped rice on the bottom. All that was finished just right.Just to clarify what I've seen in other reviews, when you go in, your whole table orders at the counter together and is given a shared number. When someone from your table has an order up, your number is called. It may be called several times, at different points. If you order a dish that takes longer to prepare than others (like the manduguk) you will find other numbers higher than your own being called. These folks aren't cutting in line -- it's just part of the kitchen's process.Once you pick up your order, you will stop by a side table near the counter to get your silverware / chopsticks, etc. When you have finished, you return to the front on the other side with your tray, which you place in a cafeteria cart. Efficient, no frills, but relatively fast even on busy days (15-20 minutes to get served something cooked up fresh to order).BTW, I've also heard some reviewers writing in to say they feel they've been treated differently because they weren't Korean. I am a Caucasian American and have felt well treated at Woori Jib. Yes, the cashier has assumed on occasion that I and the white people in line behind me are eating together because, well, white. But that's no big deal. The owner thanks me after every stop and the cashiers have helped me to explore and order.", 
      "Probably has the best ddukboki on campus! It's made in such a way that you still want to pay for it 'cause even though you can make your own version at home, their version is that much better. Also, they get the rice right every time (it's the simple things that add up).", 
      "I really liked this place. I was a little surprised to find this downtown but it was good. Very big portions, so I recommend sharing it with your friends. The bi bim bap came in a huge silver bowl, not a black cast iron pan, so the rice wasn't cooked crispy but the flavor was good and the hot sauce wasn't too spicy for the non-Korean (or none spicy) eater. The kalibi had a good flavor but the meat on the bones was a little tough. \u00a0It came together with a bowl of rice and some hot soup and of course a side dish of kimchi. You order at the front counter and wait for them to call your name. It's self service and self busing afterwards. Quick, low key and easy to eat. \u00a0Good place for a tasty meal.", 
      "When I feel like sitting down to eat some Korean, Woori Jib is where I end up. \u00a0If you get the barbeque chicken, beef, pork (I always get chicken), you get free refills on everything except for the bbq'd meat, and they have soup you can help yourself to as well. \u00a0It all comes out to around $8.Overall, I would say I like this place slightly more than Dorca's as I would come here to sit down and eat with friends as well as carry out.Delicious, quick, filling, good location, awesome.", 
      "The lure of unlimited rice refills & homemade banchan made Woori Jib our first stop in Champaign after hauling all of our belongings halfway across the country & subsisting off of salads from Costco. Woori Jib clearly caters to the hungry college crowd - you place your order up front, pick up utensils, water, & free soup to the right, then snag a table & wait until your order is called out. \u00a0After you're done with your meal, you do have to bus your own table a la Ikea style. While Woori Jib is a little pricier than the other local Korean restaurants, it also ranks as one of the highest ones. \u00a0The meat-centric dishes will knock you back $10-$12, but you will certainly get what you paid for. \u00a0I've had the divinely tender Galbi Ribs & the charred Pork Belly, while the boyfriend is loyal to the Spicy Pork Bulgogi (the only downside is that half the dish was onions). The portion sizes are quite generous, where you can certainly split an entree to feed 2 people with the add cost of $2 for unlimited rice for both, or pack up the other half for some tasty leftovers!*They accept Visa & Mastercard along with cash.", 
      "I love how Yelp has removed my first post. Either way, what I would like to say is I have seen the owners of this place reuse their food (kimchi) and put it on other plates.I had the cold noodle soup and it wasn't good. I would not recommend this place.", 
      "For those of you students who are thinking of taking jobs at St. Louis and hold Woori Jib as a standard for good grilled meat....Don't move to St. Louis... or at least plan on making random trips back for Woori Jib / Papa Dels / Pokey Stix.", 
      "This is one of my favorite Korean restaurants in Champaign! I always come here with friends and we really enjoy the food. The owners are super friendly and you can get free refills on rice. The only downside about coming here is that you leave smelling like food, so this isn't exactly the place to wear your Sunday's best, lol. Dishes I've had and loved:-galbi (short ribs)-bibimbap-bulgogi-soon du bu with beef-chicken stir fry (new fav: i get it in a spicy sauce and it comes with veggies and rice cake)", 
      "I love this place! \u00a0The food is really good, the service is quick, and the prices are pretty cheap!The barbeque is definitely what sets it apart from the other Korean restaurants on campus, but they also have a lot of other great dishes like the dolsat bibimbap.Mmm. \u00a0I definitely come here probably too much for it to be normal haha.", 
      "For a college campus Korean restaurant, I think Woori Jib is the most genuine and the best in the area. It doesn't say much, but it counts.I've enjoyed the galbi, cold buckwheat noodles, bibimbap, and many more dishes. They aren't bad. For a college student, it might be slightly pricey, but they've got to satisfy their cravings too, right?Just don't compare Woori Jib to the Korean restaurants you grew up going to or to the Korean restaurants outside of Champaign, and you'll be content.", 
      "In general, most Champaign area Korean restaurants start out with bad service. This place is no different. After ordering your food, it typically takes 10-15 minutes to get your food, and it doesn't always come out in the same order as you ordered. On top of that, you'll often have other people that cut into line and get the same food that you ordered before they did.On this occasion, I ordered duk mandu guk and it came with soggy seaweed in it. For the price of $10, it was a bit more expensive than other Korean restaurants in the area. In addition, it didn't taste spectacular to any degree. The only consolation was that it came in such a big bowl that I could take a little bit home for a leftover meal.Another dish that is pretty popular is their BBQ bulgogi. It usually comes with a special sauce but it really depends on the day to figure out whether it's good or not. Sometimes, it's under cooked. Other times, it's over cooked and burnt. They also use about a 50% onion to 50% meat ratio so it seems like you are paying for a lot of onions and not a whole lot of meat.The seating is usually crammed so during rush hours, it's hard to find a seat. There is very little room to back your seat out as seats are pretty much back to back.", 
      "Definately pricier than what I would pay for in the city but their food was pretty good. \u00a0Service was quick and simple - more like a fast food Korean joint.\rTHeir kimchi was typical but still good. \u00a0Their bulgogi was a bit saltier than what I'm used to. \u00a0My friend had this omelette looking dish but inside was fried rice which looked pretty yummy.", 
      "its a dive alright. \u00a0very loud with the kitchen all yelling orders at once. I had the bibimbop, which was ok and they do use ground beef. \u00a0in a pinch its fine for when you crave korean.", 
      "This is easily one of the best Korean restaurants here in Champaign. I really enjoyed the Pork Stir Fry and the Pork Bulgogi. While the dishes are slightly overpriced, I feel that the serving portions are quite large. Woori Jib had a very unique dipping sauce, which I felt complimented my Bulgogi. In addition to your meal, you receive tiny dishes of kimchi and other vegetables. Overall, I do recommend this place to anyone in Champaign interested in getting Korean food.", 
      "I have been going here for 4 years and I am never disappointed.They have the best bi bim bop. \u00a0It is fantastic. \u00a0It is always a large portion and every ingredient is always so fresh. \u00a0I also love the chicken stir fry. \u00a0It is so well seasoned and has the perfect ratio of meat to veggies. \u00a0They are not stingy. \u00a0I have yet to try a dish on their menu that I do not enjoy. \u00a0I will continue to keep going here time and time again.", 
      "Looking for Korean BBQ (Bulgogi / Kalbi?) In my opinion this is the best place to go in urbana champaign. Portions are extremely generous, with free soup to start your meal, you cant go wrong. unlimited kimchi and rice and sauce also comes with every meal so if you are very hungry you can always refill on that stuff. Definitely a place I've been to multitude of times", 
      "Best restaurant in Champaign hands down. Other Korean restaurants do not have an indoor GRILL so the meat cannot be compared to Woori Jib!!!! \u00a0The soups and other dishes are also amazing!!! I've been in Champaign for a long time now and have gone to Woori Jib religiously and its always delicious. If you don't know what to get, start with the BBQ beef or Kalbi (BBQ beef short rib). Go see for yourself, you won't be disappointed!!!", 
      "Ugh, went in for lunch today, and it was just plain disappointing. Had the pork bulgogi and it was greasy and bland. The onions were very undercooked as well. The rice was also cooked with too much water, making it mushy. I couldn't finish it. Either this dish just isn't good here, or there are consistency problems. Either way, last time I come here.", 
      "Probably the best Korean in town. \u00a0Expensive but so is Ah-ri-rang (their competitor). \u00a0This place introduced me to korean food so I can recommend it for people looking to try korean. \u00a0They have unlimited soup (jigae?) and hot/cold water to make tea with if you want to don't miss that.If you're more adventurous try a Jigae (korean stew) or Dolcet Bibim Bop. \u00a0If you're lame then get Bulgoki like everyone else :-p", 
      "It took me awhile to try all the Korean restaurants on campus, and I'm sorry to say that this is my least favorite out of the many to choose from, I mean it's okay but I've had better. At first glance the place is a little small and has a very casual setting. There aren't many servers on hand, and it was not too busy when my party went in. \u00a0Now if you've been reading my reviews, I never judge a restaurant solely on experience, cause it's all about the food. I didn't mind the small size because it reminded me a family-style, close knit style of eating with friends and family. \u00a0The food was decent but not the best I've had. I ordered the spicy pork and got some tofu soup on the side. \u00a0When the food came out, the portion size was not as big as other restaurants like Ari-rang or Bwon and did not have much flavor to it. It was kinda bland and not as spicy as I would've like it. Now I remembered one of my friends telling me you could get umlimited soup, so I went to the little station they had set up and it was seaweed soup. The problem with it was that it tasted like water and no flavor at all, so besides it being unlimited, one bowl was enough for me. Everything else was pretty good, the ban chan was good and I enjoyed the free refills on everything, and tofu soup portions were actually of good size. Overall, a pretty decent place, but I've had better Korean food on campus (and off-campus at Bwon) and would recommend trying those places first.", 
      "I ordered cold noodles with sashimi to go, but when I opened it at home, who can tell me where is the fuck sashimi?!!!!", 
      "I am not a fan of Korean food because I always smell like food on the way out. \u00a0However, I tried Chicken Stirfry at Woori Jib, and I keep going back for it. \u00a0Perfect, perfect, perfect!!!", 
      "This is a great place to go on a cold winter day. The food is both spicy and warm. First I usually get a bowl of what seems to be miso soup, which is complimentary with your meal. They use really good meat for their spicy barbeque and it's delivered smoking hot to your table with bowls of kimchi and other Korean specialties. Some dishes might seem a little pricey, but most can easily feed two people", 
      "I used to visit U of I a lot in my previous life. For a college town, this place has the best Korean food, probably within the proximity of 200 miles. The rice and soup can be refilled. The price is reasonable. What more can you ask for when you're a cheap college bastard? SRSLY!", 
      "words cannot describe my love for this place.I have been to korea... and I have no had better soondubu than this place.I know a lot of people say they add a TON of MSG in their food... but I'm okay with that as long as it taste as good as this. Suggestions:- Chicken Noodle Soup- soondubu jjigae (with galbi) - Stir fry (very big portions)- Galbi (taste amazing but portion size have gotten signif smaller)- Duk buk gi (they might have changed up the recipe a bit cuz i looked different now)- CALL AHEAD and place ur order ot avoid the long wait.- GRAB A TABLE the minute you step in that place because they'll get pretty packed around meal time- they are closed on Sunday so keep that in mind. - Oh and you can ask for second bowl of rice- ps. they got rid of the soup thing they put outside now.. but it didn't taste good anyways", 
      "Woori Jib has 2 versions of bulgogi - barbequed/grilled and pan cooked. I think their grilled bulgogi definitely sets them apart from other Korean restaurants in town. It is delicious. Their menu is not as extensive as Dorcas though.", 
      "This is not Korean food. It's not even mediocre Korean food. It is just a bad restaurant.My boyfriend and I went here and I ordered the Kalbi. I paid $12.00 and was stunned when it came out. My meat was mostly fat and bones, and there was not even one serving of meat. The soybean soup was simply gritty and tasted like it came from a cheap pre-made mix. They only gave me two pieces of kakdugi and three meagre slices of kimchi. Most Korean restaurants, for $12.00 you get five of six banchan (side dishes). If you want to really experience Korean food, go to Good Fellas. For slightly more, you get the full meal and refills on banchan. And they definitely don't charge you $12.00 for bones and fat.", 
      "Kinda dirty, but their gamma tangs pretty good.", 
      "I've given this another chance... I have to update my review from two stars to one star... an (almost $10) SEAFOOD AND TOFU soup cannot have barely three pieces of tofu, some red pepper paste, lots of salt, lots of water and (I kid you not!) ONLY ONE MUSSEL inside. Yeah, that's their \"seafood soup\" now - no shrimp, no anything else... just ONE SINGLE LOUSY MUSSEL. Greedy owner, incompetent \u00a0Mexican cook (the Korean owner used to be a decent chef, but now he slacks off and lets the Mexican guy do all the cooking), racist attitude. Yes, both Woori-Jib and B-Won seem to have this \"what are you doing here? You can't possible know what Holy Korean Food is about\" attitude if you're not Korean yourself. I haven't seen similar racism and superior attitudes in Chinese restaurants for example, not even in Japanese restaurants, which offer, on the average, food which is a lot more refined. Shame on you, Woori Jib!", 
      "Love their juicy beef rice but not the cold noodle. It's nice that \u00a0they have free spicy bean sprout soup all the time. Price is fair and service isn't bad.", 
      "Many of their dishes are still average, but I branched out and had their grilled mackerel on my last visit - Oh. My. \u00a0God. \u00a0It was DELICIOUS! \u00a0So apparently if you order things on the menu that most Americans wouldn't, the food is awesome.", 
      "Some disagree, but I believe this is the best Korean food on campus. \u00a0My favorite is the Korean Barbecue. \u00a0It is a bit more expensive at $8, but it is definitely a solid meal. \u00a0You can get free rice and sauce refills by walking up to the kitchen with your bowl."

      "\"Surprisingly good Italian food for the area.\"Ordered the Fritto Misto as an appetizer. A great starter with Shrimp, Calamari and Scallops. Our table had the 2010 San Silvestro Dolcetto Monferrato Anselmo bottle of wine with our meal. Per the advice of the waiter, ordered the Pork's Lover's pizza as my main course. Good meaty personal pizza, large in size. Had Creme Brulee topped with fruit for dessert. Daily specials offered, generally better than the menu. Open for lunch as well.", 
      "I was in Urbana alone on business and wanted to dine at a nice restaurant within walking distance of the Illini Union where I was staying. The restaurant had a nice ambiance and the wait staff was professional. I ordered the halibut with brussels sprouts and proscuitto. The lemon beurre blanc sauce served with the fish was divine. The white wine I had was also very good. I was too full for dessert but wanted to try the lemon tart so I ordered it to go. I figured I could have it later while I worked in my hotel room. I was surprised when I got my bill and saw that I was charged .50 for the container b/c I asked for the tart to go. It's not a big deal but after paying over 60.00 for my meal (for one), this left a negative impression. I've gotten dessert to go at other restaurants of all different price ranges and have never been charged for a container. I wonder if I had eaten part of the tart at the restaurant and then asked for the rest to go if they would have still charged me the .50. Again, not a big deal but this changed my impression of Timpone's from being an upscale restaurant to a fine restaurant wanna-be.", 
      "Totally average for what it is trying to be. The food is competent but a little boring and is perhaps a hair overpriced. Gnocchi tends to be pretty ok.", 
      "Ordered seafood risotto, and spinach pizza with artichoke hearts and goat cheese. Both are delicious!", 
      "The food wasn't memorable, but the service was.Our waitress had no idea what she was talking about and seemed abrasive and rude! \u00a0Unfriendliness aside, she didn't even do her job very well.It's expensive, and just based on service alone, I wouldn't go back.", 
      "First time coming here with a bunch of friends. Many of us ordered the Fettuccine with Salmon Pasta, which was horrible. Not a single one of us thought it was decent. I had a difficult time choking it down after a whole hour of picking at it. Service was pretty good, although the food was not that great for the price you pay. The portion sizes are very small. The beef tenderloin was way above its price range for the amount you get and there's better out there. Overall, my experience was pretty bad...The creme brulee was the only thing that was worth praising there, although it is a tad too sweet for many of us.", 
      "I feel that this could be a perfectly good restaurant but every time I go there they just miss it. \u00a0So if you want an expensive meal that just misses tasting good, go here.I had a perfectly good burger that had apparently been sitting too long before the waiter brought it out: the bottom bun had turned to soggy mush. \u00a0So close!I tried a tomato bisque with goat cheese lumps in it that had a lot of potential but there were so many goat cheese lumps that the balance was all wrong. \u00a0When you order a tomato bisque it should taste like tomato, I reckon. \u00a0Almost!I had a fancy-pants mushroom and sausage pizza. \u00a0Each ingredient seemed good by itself, but as a whole it had a taste I would describe as \"many strong clashing cheeses.\" \u00a0Nearly there!", 
      "For two years I walked past the singularly unimpressive facade of Timpone's with its dated looking sign, convinced that such a place could only continue to remain open because it was obviously a front for some illegal racketeering scheme or other sinister enterprise.Then I went for lunch.I am still not entirely convinced that there is not a vicious syndicate running the location, but I was pleasantly surprised by my experience. \u00a0Well-made salads, great food options, and wonderfully arrayed. \u00a0I ended the entire adventure with a lovely dessert and coffee and emerged mildly regretful for having judged Timpone's so harshly.However, if there's a raid one day I wouldn't be surprised. ;)", 
      "I went here last night for my birthday dinner, and I was extremely happy with the entire experience. The biggest plus for me, aside from the food that is, was the waitstaff. All of the servers were very friendly and professional, and I could tell they all looked out for each other. Case in point, I noticed some lint on one of my glasses of wine, and before I could even say anything, one of the other waiters saw me studying the glass and quickly came over and offered to replace it.Speaking of wine, the selection was great, but I was unfortunately relegated to the limited \"wine by the glass\" menu since I was the only red wine drinker at my table. Even so, the selection of wine by the glass was well-rounded and pretty solid, and our waiter's wine recommendations were spot on. Now, for the food!Bread and olive oil is complimentary, of course, and very tasty (so simple...but so good!). For starters, we ordered the crab cakes as well as a spring salad with walnuts and gorgonzola, both of which were very good. For my entree, I had the roast duck, which came with fingerling potatoes, red cabbage, spring vegetables. The entire dish was fantastic. Moist duck, perfectly cooked vegetables, and a wonderful sauce that had blueberries in it. A simple dish done very, very well.In all, Timpone's is a great place for a gourmet meal at a pretty decent price. They have a nice selection of veg-friendly dishes, too (not vegan, however). I can't recommend this place enough. Give it a try!", 
      "I don't usually go out for Italian food because Italian food is easy to make. \u00a0I make pasta at least once a week. \u00a0Why pay $15+ per person for the pleasure?But I was taken out to Timpone's for lunch for my birthday. \u00a0I'd been especially hesitant about Timpone's when thinking about trying Italian food here...mostly because their logo is so yuck and tired looking. \u00a0Yes, I do judge a book by its cover. \u00a0I was not more impressed when we entered the building, as the restaurant looked like an old timey lounge or shabby hotel lobby.My experience was proof of why it's wrong to judge books by their covers (though I'll still continue to do so). \u00a0Timpone's offers a pretty extensive and moderately priced lunch menu, ranging from salads, to pasta, to individual pizzas, to entrees. \u00a0Most items were between $8-12. \u00a0AND all of the menu seemed relatively innovative. \u00a0For instance, they offer a pizza that has broccoli, shrimp, and goat cheese. \u00a0You know you want that. \u00a0I had meatloaf (!!! \u00a0who even has that on a menu?! \u00a0excitement!) that came sliced, wrapped in thick bacon, on a fluffy bed of creamily dreamy mashed potatoes. \u00a0There was just the right amount of tasty mushroom gravy and crisp-tender green beans scattered throughout. \u00a0Holy hell. \u00a0It was so fantastic. \u00a0My dining companion had grilled shrimp with a less-mushy guacamole on top of polenta. \u00a0See? \u00a0Tasty and innovative. \u00a0Even better, we got the last table in the restaurant, but the waitress AND the food both came promptly. \u00a0Awesome.", 
      "It's kind of funny how you go through your college years with a certain perspective on cost. \u00a0Back in my day, anything over 5 bucks for a meal was expensive. \u00a0I never went to Bread Company or to Timpone's until after I came back to visit my now wife.But now? \u00a0I'm freaking rich, bitches. \u00a0I can order what I want, where I want. \u00a0That's right. \u00a012 bucks for a plate of awesome pasta with bolognese sauce? Why yes, I can afford that. \u00a0I actually have a paycheck that isn't from wiping tables or undergraduate research!The times I've been to Timpone's has always been impressive. \u00a0My most recent visit, however, made me appreciate this place all the more. \u00a0I can't say that I've had a better pasta with bolognese sauce. \u00a0Sure, it's a seemingly absurdly simple dish, but everything about the thing was just right.The wife got a fried oyster and spinach salad that was extremely delicious as well. \u00a0I kept meaning to ask what sort of oysters they were, because you don't typically see consistently small oysters like that. \u00a0Alas, the mother-in-law has since moved away from the Champaign/Urbana area so our visits will be fewer and farther in between. \u00a0I'll have to make it a point to visit this place whenever we aren't stuffed on pokey stix...", 
      "I took my Dad here when he was visiting. \u00a0I was expecting it to be expensive, but also to be a solid dining experience. \u00a0Sure it is one of the few very nice restaurants on campus, but from now on I will go off campus to eat nice meals. \u00a0The food was okay. \u00a0The dishes were pretty small for the price.Worst of all was the service. \u00a0It took forever to get anything done and while the waittress was very nice, it was unpleasant. \u00a0Also, it was too loud for my Dad and I to talk which was our main intention. \u00a0Lastly, this was in the winter and there was a huge draft whenever anybody entered the restaurant that forced us to put our jackets on.", 
      "Three people on a Wednesday night. \u00a0Sat downstairs, which is like eating in the foyer. \u00a0One glass of wine, two personal pizzas, bowl of pasta and 3 salads equaled a tab of $60 before tip. \u00a0The pizza is great, but the total experience was meh. \u00a0This restaurant ought to have a lower priced menu for the folks sitting downstairs and getting food dished out by the bartender, and a higher priced menu would be fair for folks sitting upstairs enjoying the white tablecloth experience.I'll go again, but a $7/three-ounce glass of wine ought to be enjoyed upstairs, and was simply incongruous for the casual meal-in-the-doorway we had.", 
      "This is a tale of two experiences. My husband would vote his meal as a three, where I am sticking with a two. To be fair, he is much better at understanding flavor dynamics on paper than I am, which is probably why we ended up with two different experiences.This review is split into two parts: the ambiance and service aspect, followed by the food review. My husband and I agree, though, that two stars are definitely warranted for the former portion.There are three important items to note before entering Timpones. The first is that the decor is absolutely ridiculous; reminiscent of a Miami night club circa 1984. The second thing is that the wait staff do not seem to know what's going on, which can perhaps be attributed to the third thing. The manager yells at their wait staff in front of all patrons, which I can only assume makes the wait staff SUPER NERVOUS. Of course, I am generalizing based on one experience, and yet it seems other Yelpers share similar sentiments.Of course, the above items relate strictly to ambiance and service. Important, but not the end-all, be-all of a meal, so let us move on.We started off with a goat cheese and arugula salad. On paper, this was an exciting start to this meal! But when it came out? A total disappointment. It is seldom, even when a meal is not good, that I think, \"this was shallow/vacuous/trite/vapid\" and yet that is exactly what it tasted like.For dinner, my husband ordered a hearty stew with an interesting citrus, chocolate, and red meat dynamic. He enjoyed it, and rated it a three. I had the spinach tagliatelle that was underwhelming at best. There was very little flavor, but tons of cream. I thought the texture was nice, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. No dessert--we had tried enough.I am not sure if we will be going back here. I promise that there are restaurants in Urbana-Champaign that are WAY better. Perhaps they do not cost as much, or have as gaudy of interiors, but... they taste good. And I'm not so sure that the same can be said of Timpones.", 
      "First time I was hear the food was pretty good, but I came back recently for their Italian Sandwich and it was terrible -- just meat and bread, nothing else.Update: came back and tried a pasta dish. It was completely overcooked and had the consistency of paste. Blech.", 
      "\"Three raviolis in my dish?! This better be the appetizer portion!!\"My experiences with TImpone's are fairly inconsistent. Food is not bad tasting in any way, but I always leave just a little dissatisfied. Portions are incredibly small and well, if you wanna be \"that kind of place\"...you should move out of Champaign. It's fine for a date, business dinner, something of that sorts, but definitely not the kind of place I'd keep coming back to.", 
      "Tjis place is out of the price range for most college kids and I feel the food is very average. Which would be fine if I wasn't paying extra for average food. I got taken here twice for a focus group for my major and since it was free I cant complain. But there's no way I would pay full price here.I'm a heavy eater. And by heavy eater I mean I normally throw down to or three normal entrees at regular restaurants.these portions do not fill the average person though. Its not a bad restaurant but its not great either.", 
      "I think this may be the best restaurant near the U of I. \u00a0Standard Italian food, but some wonderful improvisations in addition. \u00a0I don't know where they get their seafood, but the swordfish is the best I've ever had. \u00a0Also pastas, steaks, and great vegetables - they are committed to organic ingredients. \u00a0Spend a few hours and taste a few appetizers before dinner. \u00a0Reasonably comprehensive wine list and full bar. \u00a0Cordial service, but they keep it leisurely, so let them know if you've got a curtain later. \u00a0The owner comes around to make sure you feel well cared-for.Note: they serve lunch M-F from 11:30 until 3. \u00a0Dinner begins at 5 p.m.", 
      "Timpone's is a very nice restaurant, particularly at dinnertime. My boyfriend and I went here for a nice post-valentine's day weekend dinner (we knew it wouldn't be too busy this weekend, so we opted to do our v-day dinner this weekend instead.) When we walked in, the door and sign were very old-looking, but in a charming way, so that was promising.The first floor is a little more laid-back, but they say you can go to the upper floor if we'd like, so we opted for that. It was very nicely decorated with sculptures, paintings, and plants. The other diners were dressed casually, but still nice, if that makes sense. Like, jeans with a button-up or nice sweater. It was quite nice up there and the service was lovely. I ordered the veal and it was absolutely delicious, and the perfect portion size; however, it was not the perfect portion size for the price. For a $29 entree, I expected a little more on the plate, or for the price to be lower for the same amount. None the less, the food was delicious and so was my boyfriend's. We ended up sharing the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert and it was very good.Overall, the staff was very attentive and helpful. Although the atmosphere was slightly intimidating, it still had a nice, cozy, fancy-restaurant feel, and I wouldn't mind going again.TLDR: It's a nice place with good food and service, but expect to shell out some dough.", 
      "Go here if you want free food poisoning.My mom got food poisoning from some shrimp she ate here. For the rest of the day, she was vomiting. Needless to say, I'll never eat there again.Not only is the food bad, the owner is an absolute horror. I haven't dealt with him personally but he's got a very bad reputation. I talked with several people who worked here and they said he was just horrible. I'm amazed that they are still in business.", 
      "I think this place is great.. probably the best Italian you can get in town and so much better than the Great Impasta or Biaggi's. \u00a0The service can be a hit or miss.. and yes, the stuff on the menu can be pricey.. but it's well worth it. \u00a0Great date place! \u00a0Try one of their goat cheese pizzas (it's not like Papa John's at all), specials (especially if it's steak or anything with foie gras), and creme brulee. \u00a0I'm not crazy about the tiramisu.. I think it's a bit too alcoholic.The best thing about it is that it's on campus.. so even students can go there on a school night.", 
      "I don't comment unless it's mindblowing or horrid...If you're looking for \"italian\" go to olive garden or some crap place like that. \u00a0Timpone's has a seasonal menu, diverse offerings, and expertly prepared foods. \u00a0I don't think Timpone's bills itself as an \"Italian restaurante\" \u00a0Okay, pasta is on the menu too, but is that all it takes to be pigeonholed about being Italian? \u00a0Or the name?Yes, the decor is bad. \u00a0But the food transcends...Far & above, it is the best place to dine in Champaign/ Urbana.Timpone's offers the freshest, most expertly prepared cuisine that I am aware of, and, for the quality, it is under-priced.", 
      "Little diamond in the rough. Ambiance and location were great but the linguine I had was a bit \u00a0oily.", 
      "Went here for a lunch about six weeks ago (takes me a while to digest my thoughts, so to speak). Had a goat cheese pizza, and it was PRETTY TASTY. Prices were right for a joint of its kind, and the place itself had a nice decor, which made it, all around, really solid.", 
      "Every time I've gone to the Canopy Club to see some raucous rock show, I've always wondered if folks at Timpone's were being disturbed by wailing guitars and so forth.Still no answer on this but I have found that it's somewhere I'll want to be coming back to. Well, I ordered the papardelle with the bolognese. Being a bolognese snob (and believing very sincerely that the best bolognese I've had was made by yours truly), I have to say it was certainly up to my standards. In addition, I had a slice of my neighbor's margherita pizza which was also tasty. I've not been to any other Italian restaurants in town, but this is Chicago-quality stuff right here. While it's a little on the expensive side, it is finer dining. It's not somewhere I'd expect to go every day for lunch but it would be nice for special occasions, dates, etc.", 
      "Having gone to Timpone's for the first time for dinner with Sean Astin and the rest of the IUB Enriching Programs committee, I thought my lunch experience here would disappoint. The bar is on the ground floor and we got seating on the first floor. \u00a0We ordered a Margarita pizza, two 8oz hamburgers (one with avocado one with cheese), and I ordered a Tagliatelle with Chicken Breast, Prosciutto, Peas, Tomato Cream, Basil, Romano. I've had the pizza here before and it's not bad but the pasta I had today was pretty good. The portions were pretty small though- it could just be that I'm comparing it with other campus eateries, when this is on a whole nother level. This is the first time I've ever been here for lunch and I have to say that I'm impressed. I had a great time.I strongly recommend the Burgers here -they're cooked to perfection and priced just right. This is a classy place so make sure you wait to be seated, even for lunch! My only regret is that I didn't explore their beverage selection...", 
      "I'm rather surprised at the reviews here. This place is expensive, and the portions are smaller, but that's how high-class dining works. If you want big portions (and often I do, so I understand the desire), go to Nyro's and get a triple gyro plate. The food is superb, and the waitstaff is excellent. The interior is very cozy and lodge-like (upstairs, anyway). Also, I typically don't like gourmet pizzas (I'm a blue-collar pizza kind of guy) but they really have some excellent pizzas here.On busy college weekends (like parents' weekend or whatever they call it) it's tough to get a reservation here. It's also the place that visiting scholars are often brought to be dined. The food will not disappoint.", 
      "The atmosphere: The downstairs bar area is small and cheap looking. The dining room is dated and screams \"cheap 1980's supper club\" - not at all romantic! The restaurant was filled with retirement-age couples/parties about to head to a Krannert performance on the Wednesday evening that we went. This past week, we went to Timpone's to celebrate my birthday. We started off sharing the \"Fritto Misto\" appetizr, described as \"Calamari, Gulf Shrimp, Scallops, Red Onion, and Zucchini.\" When the dish arrived, it was nothing but a pile of glorified onion rings. There were only three pieces of calamari (small tentacles), 3 shrimp (which were small, and clearly of the phosphate-pumped Asian variety, and a scattered few wet calico scallops...95% of the \"Fritto Misto\" was red onion. I feel as though by listing the seafood first, that indicates that the bulk will be seafood, or at the very least, there will be an even distribution of the components. Not wanting to be a \"difficult customer\", I chalked it up to just a \"bad batch.\" That being said, the recipe was a straight copy of Judy Rodgers' dish in the Zuni Cafe (San Francisco) cookbook, and I could have made it at home...However, when I received my entree, \"Sea Scallops with a Dijon Beurre Blanc on a bed of celery root puree\"... I was furious. There were 5 scallops, each approximately the size of a quarter (no exaggeration) and only seared on one side. The mound of puree could not have been more than 1/2 cup (and didn't even taste good). My husband ordered \"Chianti-Braised Shortribs with Homemade Gnocchi\" - which came with fewer than 10 small gnocchi. Worst of all, the food tasted bad; the beurre blanc was so sweet it was like Creme Anglaise with Dijon and I could have done a better braise at home easily. \u00a0I know that times are tough, and that food costs are supposed to be ~30% of the final restaurant price- but I felt completely gouged. I'm happy to pay for a delicious meal and I do not expect large portions. I travel pretty frequently to Chicago and DC- I know what good food costs and what \"normal\" portion sizes are at \"fine dining\" restaurants. I did not want to make a scene because I didn't want my husband to feel bad for picking the restaurant. The only reason this place could possibly stay in business is because of its proximity to campus/the Krannert Center for Performing Arts or because most people have very low expectations due to the lack of \"Fine Dining\" in the C-U area.Our server was very attentive and great, but the food was so bad (even with the small portions, we didn't finish our food and didn't want to take the leftovers home!). We will not be returning.", 
      "This place survives because it is on campus, and very conveniently located. \u00a0it is also the only restaurant within striking distance of the university that serves wine and has cloth napkins, which means that it is full of administrators and professors. \u00a0The food is not at all good, but it has no competition if you need to take adults out to a semi-decent restaurant you can walk to from campus. \u00a0You should definitely avoid anything involving duck as a topping, because it basically comes out looking and tasting exactly like pastrami from Schnuck's. \u00a0If you like that, ignore what I wrote.", 
      "Timpone's is a solid restaurant. The ingredients are fresh, and the menu changes often enough to keep things interesting. I would say that the food is overpriced, but it's hard to get \"nice\" food directly on campus, so you pay a premium for convenience I guess. I've been here a good number of times over the years, and every time was an enjoyable trip, except once. I took someone here on a date, and we were seated in an area where the lights weren't working and the speakers were broken. I'm guessing they figured they could just put students there and get away with it. I complained (the restaurant wasn't near full and I had placed a reservation), they were nice about it and moved us and the rest of the dinner went very well. The decor leaves something to be desired, but otherwise a solid restaurant, with decent service and good food.", 
      "They change their menu base on fresh food they get. It's the only real Italian restaurant in town. Good place for gathering and family.", 
      "This is one of the very early fine-dining restaurants in CU. \u00a0Picture a midwestern take on a NYC restaurant, circa 1980's (though a little later 80's now since they did some updating). \u00a0The menu, though printed daily, doesn't stray far - pasta, some fish options, sometimes steak, risotto. \u00a0Service varies, and unfortunately there is a lot of server turnover. \u00a0I have eaten here many times b/c it is close to areas of the University in which I work. \u00a0At one point this was a bit of the \"make the scene\" place, and it is convenient for pre- or post-concert dining at Krannert. \u00a0Nevertheless, many other places have come along since this one, and while I would say it's in the top handful of places in town, it is no longer at the top. \u00a0I would also recommend lunch over dinner...very similar menus, and I tend to get better lunch service.", 
      "This review is a bit late in coming since I haven't eaten there since 1999, but this is what I wrote back then: \u00a0Is this the best Italian place in town? \u00a0I don't know - I always get one of the fish specials - it's definitely the best place in town to get fish. \u00a0Portions are small, especially for an Italian place, which makes it a better \"date\" place - you don't have to worry about getting bloated. \u00a0You will even have room left to gourmandize one of their great desserts with your date.", 
      "I really enjoyed a celebratory dinner I recently had at at Timpone's. \u00a0I'd always meant to try it out but never had. \u00a0The food was really good, the service was excellent and it had a nice cozy romantic feel. \u00a0It was, however, pretty expensive, particularly for being located on a college campus. \u00a0The food was fantastic but portions were on the small side, especially considering the prices. \u00a0The peach bread pudding was scrumptious. \u00a0I probably won't be back, not because it wasn't good, but because there are a lot of other upscale places in town I'd like to try before I break the bank at Timpone's again, and special occasions that warrant a $100 tab only come along so often.", 
      "I love this place. \u00a0The menu rotates occasionally, and there is a specials board when you walk in (make sure to check the board or ask the server...sometimes the servers forget to tell you about the specials). \u00a0Food had always been stellar, from the basic burger to elegant salads, intriguing pizzas, and awesome pastas. \u00a0My fav is the gorgonzola gnocci, which is a rotating item. \u00a0Dessert is also good, maybe a bit pricey. \u00a0Creme brulee is always there and very good, gelato too.", 
      "Timpone's reminds me of Italian places at home run by a family you grew up with, and you just go because they are part of the community. I've never really been wowed by the food. It's average. And really too expensive for college kids. Good not great.", 
      "They really do a good job. \u00a0We invited 20 clients to go last night and called with a 1/2 hr notice for a reservation. \u00a0 They balked, but said they could do it. \u00a0We arrived and they accommodated the group just fine. We relaxed with a few bottles of wine ordered our meals and enjoyed some appetizers and conversation. \u00a0 Soon, everything came out of the kitchen and was great. \u00a0Later the Chef or Owner came up to check in with us and received great feedback from all. \u00a0The meal was a success and everyone was happy. \u00a0We will be back!", 
      "I've now been to Timpone's a couple of times for lunch (it seems like whenever I visit UIUC someone takes me here). It's pretty much located on campus, which makes it an easy destination if you're working for the university. The food is vaguely Italian with some American influences, and it's pretty good overall if not mind-blowing. Last time I was there I had the tuna burger, which wasn't bad, although I was a little disappointed when the tuna turned out to be a tuna patty and not an actual piece of tuna. They give you free bread... nice. Friendly service too. I just wish the food were a little more impressive.", 
      "This place has been here for a long time but I think it's still trying to figure some things out \u00a0The menu is very ambitious for a campustown location, serving up \"campustown\" pizza along side upscale American/French/Italian fare. \u00a0The dining room is upstairs and is nice enough in a traditional way, but the look and ambience are very dated. \u00a0The quality of service is not in line with the menu. \u00a0Our server was clearly overwhelmed. \u00a0Our table had white linens bespeaking of a \"nice\" restaurant but was set improperly. \u00a0Wrong silverware, no bread plates. \u00a0We sat for quite some time before our drink order was taken, then our waiter left in the middle of taking the drink order to serve food to another table. \u00a0He eventually returned to take our drink order and then asked us for our entire food order at the same time. \u00a0Bread service was slow though the bread was good. \u00a0The glass of riesling we ordered was clearly from a bottle that had been left open for too long. \u00a0Another glass from a fresh bottle arrived after a while.We ordered some salads to start off the meal. \u00a0The bistro salad looked great - field greens, asparagus, potato, poached egg, bacon, vinaigrette. \u00a0However, when the salad arrived, there was no bacon. \u00a0Ahem. \u00a0\"Excuse me, but our salads have no bacon.\" \u00a0Response: \"OMG, forgot the bacon.\" \u00a0Instead of taking our salads away and giving us new ones, we were given small bowls of bacon pieces to put on the salads ourselves. \u00a0Please.We ordered a wild mushroom pizza with sausage and gorgonzola but we wanted to substitute goat cheese for the gorgonzola. \u00a0We were told this was not possible. \u00a0Restaurant policy is no substitutions, just subtractions. \u00a0We could remove the g-z but could not add goat cheese. \u00a0We ended up using the build your own pizza option and built the pizza we wanted. \u00a0What a pain in the a**! \u00a0The pizza was delicious though. \u00a0The thin crust must be one of the best I've ever had.The entrees were generally very good. \u00a0The American \"kobe\" skirt steak was tasty, having a sweet marinade reminiscent of Korean kalbi in flavor. \u00a0The duck breast was well prepared. \u00a0The trout was overcooked but was still edible.The desserts were adequate and there is a good selection of after dinner drinks and dessert wines.In summary, Timpone's has an identity crisis. \u00a0If they want to serve this type of food, then there is a level of service that is expected to go along with it which they did not meet. \u00a0It's hard to enjoy any restaurant when you are unhappy with the service. \u00a0My recommendation is to go for the pizza - then you won't need a bread plate.", 
      "Went there twice while in town for Science Olympiad. \u00a0Lunch was flavorful, help was pleasant even with some menu confusion and the fact we showed up just before lunch closing. \u00a0Didn't rush us at all. \u00a0Had shrimp and broccoli pizza (lunch and dinner), pasta with eggplant and amazing homemade ice cream for desert. \u00a0Looked at dinner menu and decided we had to go back next night for dinner since they had duck on the menu. \u00a0Dinner was also very good. \u00a0Would definitely go back next time I'm in town."

      "Went to lunch there today and it was awesome as usual. Staff is so friendly. We always sit at the sushi bar. I love the salad with house dressing! I always say I'm going to try other sushi places in town but I always come back to Kamakura. I've never had a bad meal there!", 
      "This place is a joke! Never coming here again! First time my wife and I came here the service was awful! We saw our waiter twice the entire time we were there. One to take our order and two to give us our food! We had to hunt the waiter down to get our check! Went again the 2nd time hoping the service was better.....NOPE! Same awful service. The 2nd time we were seated at a hibachi table and our seats was close to a back doorway. We could all smell trash while sitting there. When we arrived at 5pm on a Sunday, no one was there so we were hoping we get good service....I was wrong! First to be seated last to be served! So sad! We ordered drinks and the glass was filled half way!! When we asked our waitress why the drinks were only filled half way she ignored the question and pretended like she didn't hear us. We arrived at 5pm and we left at 7pm. This place sucks!!!!The BAD:Horrible service!Waiters and waitresses who don't careDrinks filled half glass Hibachi food tasted burntOne bathroom stallTrash smelling atmosphereThe GOOD:Sushi", 
      "My friend and I went there and order ramen. The service is very slow. The ramen is so bad. The soup is filled with all soy bean sauce the noodle is very very firm. hard to eat. I will never order it again", 
      "This was on Saturday.7:35pm arrived and got seated immediately7:36-7:49pm watched servers walking by, chefs bringing food out themselves, and the hostess doing nothing7:50pm got our waters and \"a server will be with you shortly\"7:51-7:59pm tried to understand what the word \"shortly\" meant8pm walked outWe went to Sushi Kame and we received way more attentive service.I might visit Kamakura again \"shortly\".", 
      "On a Saturday evening, we waited 25 minutes without anyone taking our orders. First 15 minutes went by, we confronted the hostess and was told that a waiter will be with us shortly. Waited another 10 minutes, still no one to take our order. So we walked out. Not enough waiters, the chef has to come out to serve by himself. Bad management, can't hold a dinner service on a Saturday night. Everyone in the restaurant was waiting for his or her food. I've been there many times and this was the worst experience I've ever had here.", 
      "Although pricier than many restaurants in town, Kamakura delivers the quality of dining experience. I have been there at least 3 times: one time with a large group for the grill and twice with my spouse for sushi dinners. Make sure to check timing before you go: they are closed between lunch and 5PM. The food is delicious, and the servers are attentive: often times just an eye contact is sufficient to get them to come over immediately. The decor is OK, but the environment is pleasant and quiet: great for a quiet romantic meal. The higher prices are the only reason I did not give this restaurant 5 stars. What else can I say? I'm going back soon.", 
      "Japanese restaurants are known for serving aesthetically-pleasing food which is as good as it looks. Their major foible is the fact that their food never truly gets you stuffed. This place does neither. I clearly asked for no onions on any of my order... But they put onions on every aspect of my bento box. Some of my colleagues were not even close to being full when they finished with their order. My below average bento box cost a total of $12 too. The price isn't worth it for the quality or quantity.", 
      "Don't be scared off by the exterior -- I've only dined here once, but had a good experience. I ordered the udon & inari, which came with a plate of veggie tempura, a couple inari pockets, and a nice big bowl of udon soup. For less than $12, this is by far the best deal I've seen for this meal. From other reviews it sounds like quality can vary from dish to dish, and the location makes it a hassle to get to if you don't have a car. But I would still recommend this place, and would definitely come back again for the udon & inari.", 
      "First of all, by the looks of the outside of Kamakura, I thought that the inside would look just as sketchy, but this was not the case at all. Once I opened the front doors, it was like stepping into a whole new world. It was very pretty, neat, and tidy inside. I particularly liked the booths with glass tables. They have decorative cloths covering the windows that gave the place a dim, kind of romantic lighting. It complimented the shades of blues on the booths. Another cute detail was the mini Japanese statues and figurines on the wall opposite of the windows. It helped to show a little bit of culture.There were 3 different menus, one for drinks, sushi, and Teppanyaki (Hibachi) and Teriyaki dishes. Their menus were detailed which helped a lot especially on their drinks menu. I do not find too many menus that define what flavors to expect with their sakes and wines. Although I did eye the Japanese dish menus, I was set on sushi. We ended up waiting over an hour for the sushi. They were short staffed. Only one waiter was going around taking orders and delivering the food. I saw two hostesses when I walked in which was strange to me because why would they need two hostesses when they needed more waiters. Then again it is a small restaurant and the sushi had a bit of a twist.My friend got miso soup, eel roll, and tempura salmon roll. I got a spicy scallop roll, Philadelphia roll, and spicy salmon roll. The miso was a bit salty. The eel roll was tasty. The tempura salmon roll was really cute. It looked like little tofu squares. The spicy scallop roll was so spicy that it covered the taste of the Philly roll. I made a mistake by eating that first. I thought that the pieces of fish in the sushi were a good size. Also I have never seen a spicy salmon roll made the way they made it. It has a piece of salmon in the roll and then spices on the outside. To me, I like heat so this roll was not spicy enough for me. This is where the abundance of spicy sauce on the spicy scallop roll helped out. If I come back, I would try Since the prices are a bit on the expensive side, I might come back here when I'm really craving sushi or Japanese food. I did enjoy the d\u00e9cor and small twists on the rolls though. I think this place is one of the better sushi places in Champaign-Urbana.", 
      "Pleasant staff, they need music in afternoon though, sorta sad decor needs refreshing. Food is good & inexpensive.", 
      "Had a great experience. Adam was our teppan chef and he was amazing. Very entertaining and hilarious. \u00a0Food was deliciously seasoned and cooked to perfection. \u00a0I left feeling satisfyingly full and in good spirits. I will continue to dine here.", 
      "My experience at Kamakura's Teppan lounge was luke warm and it was kind of an awkward experience. Sure, watching the chef (with mad knife skills) flip an egg with two knives and not drop it - is pretty impressive... but as far as eating a hot meal... it is practically impossible. You have to wait for the veggies to be cooked for how many ever people are at your table & then the meat is served up last. Now you're looking at luke warm veggies with semi-warm meat. \u00a0It just takes too dang long to get the entire meal on your plate. As for table conversation, last time I was there -- we were placed next to people who had one too many drinks, who were super excited about the war in Iraq and were definitely racist as hell. Wow, get way to start & end a meal. I really considered buying a drink just to throw it at them. Either way, the food is eh for 20+ dollars. For a one time experience, I say it's worth it. But I am not all that into sitting next to strangers especially when their racist remarks make me gag.", 
      "Ugh. \u00a0This place is always packed for reasons I can't quite grasp. \u00a0The parking lot looks crowded every time I drive by. \u00a0Sometimes I'm suspicious that they must hire confederate diners to make the place look popular and lure unsuspecting customers inside.I only have one thing to say about the service here. \u00a0This is the type of place where the wait staff will judge you by your potential to tip, and then ignore you if you obviously fall into the category of \"poor college student.\" \u00a0If you come here, regardless of your background, at least dress like you own money so that you'll get your drinks refilled. On a particularly busy weekend night, I showed up with a friend and expected to wait for for a table. \u00a0Good news: we were seated immediately. \u00a0Bad news: we were seated at a teppenyaki table...when we had no intention of eating teppenyaki...and we had to share the table with a large family who we obviously did not know. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, I am not offended by cafeteria-style dining (I'm a college student, after all), but this should not be the seating arrangement at a place that presents itself as some kind of fine restaurant. \u00a0Throughout the meal, I had to whisper to my dinner companion to avoid disrupting a stranger's family dinner (awkward?). \u00a0Be careful about bringing a date here, or at least make a reservation in advance.The food? \u00a0Blegh. \u00a0Let me be clear on this--I've tasted sushi on both the east coast and west coast, and I am in no way prejudiced against eating sushi in the Midwest. \u00a0I even think there's some decent sushi in Champaign (at other restaurants), so my standards are not impossible to meet.Again, I've always eaten at Kamakura on busy nights, because I naively assumed that most sushi restaurants will bring out the best fish when serving crowds of customers. \u00a0Instead, I received garbage that smelled and tasted like rotting fish. \u00a0Maybe by the time they got to my order, they had to use the smelly leftovers at the bottom of the barrel? \u00a0When I got home, I tried to purge my mouth with Listerine. \u00a0Even with it's advertised \"deep-cleaning action,\" I couldn't get the taste of putrid fish out of my mouth. \u00a0I drank some coffee, chewed gum, etc., but there was no redemption from the haunting taste of old fish. \u00a0My suggestion? \u00a0Stick to the cooked dishes at Kamakura: tempura, teriyaki, udon, etc.With so many better sushi restaurants in the area, I don't see how Kamakura hangs onto customers. \u00a0I can forgive bad service, but food that ruins your breath for an entire day is not acceptable. \u00a0This is the kind of place that gives sushi a bad reputation.", 
      "Came here for my friend's birthday. I heard great things about this place so I had high expectations. Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed.The pros: the hibachi chef was very entertaining and friendly. the food was delicious, especially the scallops - perfectly seared with a golden brown exterior and tender interiorThe cons: small portions for what you pay for, the server didn't seem to know the menu at all - seemed really frazzled, asked him several questions that he didn't know the answer to, had to ask for refills on my drink countless times, overcharged my friend's credit card by like $40...wtf.Overall, the food was decent, service was not great...not impressed", 
      "By far the best sushi in town and one of a few where you can get the \"Teppan\" grill style. Most of my reviews are in comparison to other places around and after being to a place multiple times. I have frequented Miko's, but a meal at Kamakura has converted me. The sushi is fresh tasting and just delicious.The atmosphere is a little stuffy and the teppan grill is a good, but too much for what you get, and the service has been hit or miss. But still worth a try.", 
      "We arrived at 8:45 pm on a Wednesday evening (they close at 9:00 pm). \u00a0The 'OPEN' sign was on and clearly blinking 'OPEN'. They appeared to be slow but had several tables with guests in the dining room and two tables of guests at the grill. \u00a0We asked to be seated at the grill. \u00a0We were refused service and told they were getting ready to close. \u00a0I cannot image turning away business in a poor economy. \u00a0We generally spend at lest $50.00 a person there..which I think is significant for the Champaign-Urbana market. The hostess repeatedly said, we cannot serve you because the staff would have to wait on you to finish your meal. I will never go back. \u00a0If they had been completely empty I would have had a better understanding of their position. And if they stop serving at a specific time before they close, perhaps they should turn off the 'OPEN' sign.", 
      "OK....so when I give this place 5 stars...it's because this is as good as sushi gets HERE!Really, the sushi is simple, delicious, the appetizers are great, the service is always good...there are lots of great things about this place. If this restaurant were in the middle of downtown, it would be %100 packed, %100 of the time!Thank goodness it isn't, because I have never had to wait for a table.Order the German roll (weird, I know, but it's GREAT), the Terayaki Mushrooms, the Gyoza, and the Nigiri... Also for dessert try the Mochi with red bean.. YUMMY cold chewy deliciousness!", 
      "The food was tasty, and was presented very nicely. We had a couple rolls, fried tempura appetizer, and gyoza. We enjoyed it.There were some downsides. The price was very high compared to the amount of food we received. Also, we waited a very long time for our food.It's worth trying. If your standards for Japanese restaurants aren't too high, you will most likely enjoy it.", 
      "I've eaten here a number of time and the menu is boring. \u00a0The bento boxes are okay. \u00a0The teppan is okay too. \u00a0Nothing special. \u00a0At least they don't dump sweet and sour sauce all over their food like Miko's does.But the rolls are really dissapointing. \u00a0I ordered a spicy tuna roll and they sprinkled hot flakes on top. \u00a0That's not a spicy tuna roll. \u00a0Save your money and don't eat here.Service is okay. \u00a0But who cares about the service when the food is just so pricey and mediocre.", 
      "First of all this is NOT one of my favorite types of foods. \u00a0We went for lunch and I ordered the chicken teriyaki box thing. \u00a0It wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't good either. \u00a0The portions are really small which really didn't bother me. \u00a0The salad came in the upper left square of the box. \u00a0It was about a 2 inch by 2 inch square. \u00a0The salad was good but again you only get a couple of bites of it. \u00a0What really cracked me up was the vegetables. \u00a0In the lower right box (2 x2) was ONE brocille top and a half of a mini carrot!! \u00a0The rice was really sticky but my friend told me it's supposed to be that way so it sticks on the chop sticks. \u00a0I had to use a fork of course because I can't get anything to stick on chop sticks.I like the chicken teriyaki from the mall better so maybe that tells you how much I know about \u00a0Janpanese food. \u00a0It was a fun experience and I would go again...... if someone forced me to.", 
      "I think this place deserves a 3.5 star. Ive been here about 4 times. The food was consistently good, but it's not something to write home about. The price was on the high side, but it's totally what you expected from this kind of place (the decor is nicer than what it seems from the outside). I really have a mixed feeling about this place. The food is authentic though for the most part, so I guess that's a good change from Americanized Japanese food. There was one thing I didn't like; fried salmon roll. The breading was thick and greasy. Otherwise, food was good. The whole experience was good, but there really wasn't a \"wow\" moment.", 
      "As far as I remember, this place is pretty good. A pretty unique restaurant for Champaign. Definitely sit at one of the tables where the food is cooked in front of you, it's basically a requirement.. or something. The food was consistently pretty good but nothing hugely fantastic and not a whole lot of traditional dishes, unfortunately. Never had sushi here", 
      "Place is relatively nice. Went on a Tuesday night, no crowd at all. I mostly got sushi rolls, and those were quite excellent. Nice, quiet ambience. \u00a0Little to no loud conversation, soothing atmosphere. Maybe best for couples or business dates. Would not recommend families.Delicious sushi, though! \u00a0I recommend the rainbow roll, fantastic.", 
      "Aw, poor Kamakura, why all the hate?I have a soft spot for this place, because it's been a family favorite for YEARS - my dad took us there when they first opened because he had recently discovered sushi (remember when not everyone was aware of this heaven? \u00a0However pass\u00e9 it may be now, sushi had it's place 10ish years ago...), and we continued going back periodically. \u00a0Mostly for special occasions (my Prom group went here senior year), because for our standards at the time it was pricey.We still stop in most every time I visit, usually for the Teppan. \u00a0I can't tell if the chefs/waiters aren't as jazzed about their restaurant as they used to be, or if it's just my perspective that's changed. \u00a0Either way, the experience is never \"special\" like it was back in the day.Still, they do well. \u00a0I'm surprised at the negative reviews because, to be honest, Kamakura would likely earn a solid 3.5-star average where I currently hail from (LA), and I would have thought we had higher standards for cuisine -- especially of the Asian variety -- out here. \u00a0 !", 
      "Yum!It's been a family tradition to go here for the teppan tables for anyone's birthday. It just really cozy and you get to sit around and talk while the chef prepares your food in front of you. It's great because my dad could get his white rice and steak while I can get sushi and eel and whatever else I feel like trying at the time. It will be sure to make everyone happy!The teppan meals are probably the best value since you get salad, soup, choice of meats (or two or three) and rice and veggies. You leave feeling SO full! Actually, I'd recommend sharing a portion because there's just way too much food!Don't forget to get some green tea ice cream for dessert :)", 
      "Champaign has a few places that purport to sell Japanese food. Ko-Fusion and a few chiefly Korean restaurants come to mind. Yet among these, Kamakura is the only one where the image matches the quality of the food.For a restaurant in central Illinois, especially on a road next to the middle of nowhere, there's no need to go overboard with decor. Yet Kamakura's elegant interior stands in stark contrast to the dusty cornfields outdoors. The food is diverse for a stand-alone Japanese restaurant, and makes me wonder how many of the original ingredients were traded for easier-to-obtain substitutes. The taste, like the restaurant, is elegant in spices, to make up for the decidedly bland base.I have yet to try their sushi, or bento boxes, so I cannot review those yet.", 
      "I came here after graduating back in May and my experience was pretty lackluster. \u00a0The food itself was decent, pretty good when you take into consideration that it's sushi in Central Illinois. \u00a0The problem with this place is the service. \u00a0The place wasn't busy at all, yet our waitress seemed a bit frazzled and the service was slow. \u00a0First issue was that we weren't given any napkins and had to ask once we were served food, which to be honest isn't a big issue, but it took over 30 minutes to get a couple of sushi rolls when the place wasn't busy. \u00a0Our waitress didn't really bother to stop and ask how we were doing during our meal. \u00a0When we were done eating, our waitress asked us if we wanted some green tea, to which we accepted. \u00a0However, she left and didn't come back for about 15 minutes or so, with no tea. \u00a0At this point we decided to just ask for the check and leave, which took about another 10 minutes, although she came back with tea this time. \u00a0If you have the time, then Kamakura is a pretty good choice in terms of sushi, and I've had good experiences with their teppan in the past.", 
      "Outstanding food. Oustanding service.Favorites:Teppan table with steak/chicken combo.miso or clear soup (tip: add pepper if you like)house dressing - to die for... mmmmm the best dressingsauteed mushrooms!TREAT YOURSELF!!! Take a date! Have a brew!", 
      "For the price and location, Kamakura's a nice sushi place. I used to go here much more often when I lived in the area, and I was absolutely never disappointed by the quality of the food. Considering it was central Illinois, the prices were good for the sushi we got. The simplest rolls are usually the best--but as for the fancier rolls, we enjoy the Illini roll a lot. The service, however, has been anywhere from outstanding to absolutely horrendous. Once, my friend and I went with a small group, and we saw the waiter exactly once, when he took our order. Later, when we were leaving, we received a totally incorrect check ($20 charge for an $80 meal). However, I've definitely received extremely good service here. I think when they get busy, they focus on the hibachi customers more than the sushi side.I've never had the hibachi, but we're going for a special occasion tomorrow night, so I'll update the review then.I don't understand why Kamakura's getting such a bad rap on Yelp. It's a decent place with affordable sushi. You get twice as much sushi here than at Ko Fusion for the same price--I'm sorry, I'm a little above paying for \"hipness\" in Champaign, thanks.EDIT 7/6/11My family and I had the hibachi dinner on Friday night. Again, not a whole lot of hate here. I enjoyed the speed of service, even for the busy Friday night, and the \"performance\" of the chef, which was understated but amusing. None of us in the party had a bad meal, we were all pretty happy with our food (except for my boyfriend and brother, who were a mite ticked at the portion sizes), and even my mom's girlfriend, who is notoriously picky and had never eaten Japanese food before, was content with her meal. I don't think it was overly greasy--it has butter in it, of course, but that's the style.", 
      "Took my family to Kamakura to celebrate my wife's birthday. Our food was very tasty, our chef was very personable and entertaining. We had a great meal and I'm looking forward to going back. Highly recommended!", 
      "Overpriced, mediocre sushi restaurant that only knows how to sell atmosphere and presentation. The service was good though and is the only reason that I have not given them 1 star. you really are better off buying sushi at schnuks. There are much better places in the nearby area.", 
      "Welcome to Restaurant Hell, courtesy of Kamakura. Going there with girl. Ordering Bento box (me), one of those fancy soft shell crab sushi rolls (her). Minutes go by. Many. After almost an hour, talking to the waiter. \"We've got management problems\" he says, like in a bad sitcom in which *we* the customers are supposed to feel sorry for *him*. More time passes by. Finally my lunch box comes in. Close to inedible. The Sarku chicken (cheap fast-food!) in Market Place Mall is many many degrees of magnitude better. How about the sushi we ask? \"Your order had a lot of complications (!). First they've burned your chicken then they've forgotten to put the crab in the sushi roll.\" No kidding? Not, apparently.After ten minutes: sorry we have to go, we said, we'll get the sushi roll (a $15 one!) to go. The waiter kind of half-apologizes and says: \"I won't charge you for the sushi.\" Probably we were way too polite, or didn't show anger or something, because when he brought the check the sushi was there included, with no explanation regarding the change of mind. We actually had to leave, I had an appointment. Friend eats sushi a little later.... there is no crab in it (15$ roll!), just the traces of the skin of the soft shell crab. (Yes, we know the delicacy that soft shell crab, properly prepared, can be.) All in all an incredibly bad experience, almost on a par with the other horror stories restaurants in Chambana - B Won and The Great Impasta. \u00a0 The name and reputation of Japan, for which I have the greatest respect, don't deserve this cruel bastardization!", 
      "Kamakura wouldn't be a great Japanese restaurant back home, but it's pretty good for Champaign, and my heart lept to see Katsu, Udon, Soba, and so many other thigns that remind me of home. \u00a0Te setting is a bit too 'Orientalist,' and the food average, but I'm definitely coming back, because an approximation of the food I'm used to eating in California is better than none at all.", 
      "Japanese food in central Illinois? I'm not too sure what to make of this, especially from the unflattering and nondescript building it is located in. Upon stepping inside, however, it's like you've walked into an isolated world, and nothing in the room suggests that you're in Champaign anymore. The structure of the room, though, feels more like 1950's diner than Japanese restaurant, with a huge pit in the center of the main dining room, and booths to the side. I only caught a quick glimpse of the other side of the restaurant, but it looked a lot cozier than where we were sitting.I came on a fairly quiet Friday night, with maybe only two dozen people in the restaurant, yet the service was definitely below par. After the maitre d' seated us, nobody even came to our table until she wandered back 5 minutes later asking if anyone has showed up to serve us. The waitress was pretty inattentive also; after the appetizer, my glass of water stood empty for the rest of the meal. As for the food, I ordered a beef teriyaki bento box, which came with tempura, rice, miso soup, salad, and three pieces of nigiri sushi. The beef was cooked to perfection, and coated in a teriyaki sauce as delicious as I have ever tasted. Though we are a long way from the closest ocean, the sushi also tasted very fresh. The rest of the bento box was great, as I would expect from an established Japanese restaurant. I also ordered a separate sushi roll, containing cucumber, tempura, and spicy tuna, which was very fulfilling, albeit quite pricey. This is a very decent restaurant, but for a $50+ meal in Champaign, I would expect flawless service.", 
      "First off, there was no wait. \u00a0I did seem to take a little too long for my food.I ordered Unagi, ummm, it melted in my mouth!!!! Not every place has this good of Unagi!The ahi was good and the spider roll as well.I will go back. \u00a0The presentation was not the greatest but it's the quality of the fish that I care about. \u00a0QUALITY is what Kamakura presented.", 
      "sorry excuse for a Japanese restaurant. The few times I've eaten there, the food has been extremely greasy and salty. I can't see how this place stays in business.", 
      "Worst Japanese food in town! I go here about once every three years or so to give it another chance and see if it has improved. The bottom line is that i sucks and has sucked for the past 10 years and it is not getting any less sucky with time. The food tastes the way a public bathroom smells. I think they raid dumpsters for their ingredients. There is a 1000000x better Japanese restaurant just up Neil at Church as well as many more around town. Go there instead :-)", 
      "The food was not bad... not stand out either. One thing that really bothered me though was the sticky floors. Um... there is this thing called the mop that can solve that problem for you in a jiffy!", 
      "I came here with a large party during an almost-empty lunch hour. The food took a while to get to us (45 minutes), though a number of us ordered the lunchtime bento boxes or noodles. My order was adequate --tempura bento-- if not awesome. What grossed me out was a colleague's agedashi tofu. Agedashi tofu is soft tofu battered in potato or corn starch and lightly deep fried; it sits in a dashi or seaweed broth and is garnished with ginger, bonito flakes, and/or green onions. Her tofu was tough and rubbery (overly fried, and then left to sit out for a while), swimming in a thick sweet and sour sauce and garnished with cilantro and lime slices. When she sent it back to the kitchen, observing that it was not actually agedashi tofu, our server told her that the chef is Japanese, the implication being that it must then be \"authentic.\" Baffling, considering how easy it is now to find a good agedashi tofu recipe online. I will continue to skip the Japanese restaurants in this town, thanks.", 
      "I have eaten here a few times, depite the poor reviews. I thought that the sushi was very good. It isn't cheap but you won't find a sushi place that is good and cheap. I enjoyed the sushi rolls and sashimi. The rolls were a good size and very fresh."

      "The inside of this place looks nicer than your average Mexican restaurant. The menu is overwhelming with all the options they offer. They provide your typical chips and salsa. The salsa was a little watery. I got their large pina colada and it was massive. The waitress did a great job with customer service. The food was good. If you are wanting to take sometime on a date here and are considering getting Mexican food, you should definitely try this place. Expect to pay $10 per meal.", 
      "Eh. Very greasy. The best part of this whole place is the salsa. Everything else could be better and more fresh somewhere else.I requested a stuffed poblano pepper with rice and beans instead of beans and cheese since I can't digest cheese very well. They said no. I get it but i enjoy when a restaurant tries to accommodate requests.", 
      "I'd give this 3.5 stars. It's everything you would expect in your run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. Free chips n salsa and a HUGE menu with all your classic combinations of the dame handful of ingredients. Reasonably priced for the large portions you get and the quality is good. Mostly, If you are craving solid Mexican food this is a great, clean, comfortable option. Nothing too fancy or high end. Just solid Mexican!", 
      "This is definitely a great place to grab drinks and dinner with friends on a Friday night. \u00a0The outdoor patio is spacious and the inside space is quite large as well; finding room for out party of 8 was no problem at all! \u00a0The food was pretty standard (I got the cheese quesadilla and asked to get vegetables added and our waitress was able to accommodate my request with no problem!) and the prices were very reasonable (I paid $13 for my quesadilla and a good-sized margarita, tip included). \u00a0In regards to their drinks, the servings are VERY generous! Our party enjoyed a range of their margarita selection, spanning from lime margaritas on the rocks to mango-strawberry frozen margaritas and everyone was happy with their drink of choice. \u00a0We all went with the Jumbo (or was it Grande?) size (the equivalent of a medium) and it was definitely bigger than expected, but great nevertheless!Not the best Mexican food I've had, but it was a great place to meet up with a group. \u00a0I have a feeling that I haven't seen the last of El Toro!", 
      "I'll try and not be bias. I grew up and live in Texas which is as close to \"real\" Mexican food as you'll get. Any other states Mexican food is like a fancy Taco Bell(except this awesome place in Queens). It just doesn't compare. With that being said, I'd say I liked this place. Not loved. Liked. I was seated quickly and was immediately brought chips and salsa. After a few minutes, I met my server and he took my drink order. The menu was large. I wasn't too hungry but needed to eat to avoid a headache later. It was hard to pick since all the items sounded huge. Which is great seeing how good the prices were. I was honestly amazed at their queso. Any time I go to an out of state Mexican place, they either 1. Don't have queso and loom at you like you're crazy when you order it or 2. It's from a can or the same stuff they put on your nachos at ball games. But this stuff was great. I ordered the flauta plate. Like someone else said, it arrived in 5 minutes. Strange since this was a sit down place. I would expect flautas to take at least 15 minutes to arrive. So this makes me think they were made earlier and were kept in a batch under a heat lamp. Even the family of four next time got their food in less than 10 minutes. Hmmm. But regardless, they tasted good. I brought home half of them and the rest of my rice, beans and queso. And for $10 before tip, that's pretty good to have that much leftovers. I'm giving it a 3 just because it was better than I expected and it was quick. But the servers were emotionless and socialized a lot. They were nice but didn't really smile or ask anyone how their food was or check on them. It seemed like they didn't want to be there.", 
      "The chips and queso were good and the beer was cold. \u00a0Our meals were disappointing. \u00a0Chicken fajita nachos with jalape\u00f1os were flavorless and bland. \u00a0My wife had a seafood fajita plate which was equally bad. \u00a0Flavor was lacking from all our meals - not a good experience. \u00a0El Toro needs to step up their game to be on par with the quality other Mexican restaurants in the area offer.", 
      "I'd like to dedicate my very first Yelp review to what I think is an underrated Mexican wonderland in Champaign. Maize tends to steal the spotlight, but if you're looking for a great restaurant that actually fits more then 5 people within its premises, I recommend El Toro.I went with two friends, and experienced friendly and quick service, superb cuisine, and fantastic sangria. The atmosphere is what you would expect from a family owned Mexican restaurant. It's my new go-to sit-down Mexican place. The only problems - I do not recommend ordering for pickup. The quality was compromised, but this is nothing new for any restaurant. Also, the other location of El Toro is not even half as impressive as this one. Perhaps the quality gap was due to the fact that I went to the other location with a party of 8, and the restaurant was very crowded, but I would rather order taco bell than go back to the other location. PS - if you can find yourself a DD, I highly recommend getting one of the Grande margaritas - they're literally as big as your head.", 
      "Went here with a group to drink some margaritas and eat some chips and salsa. Wonderful service and friendly staff. I ordered a grande raspberry margarita and it was nice and strong. Chips were hot and delicious and salsa was good (wish it was spicier but that's a personal preference)", 
      "This was the singularly worst meal and dining experience I have had in a very long time.The menu promises there will be a great meal here. The actual experience is extremely different. We ordered our meals and waited an hour for them to arrive. Our waiter was absent during this time. When our meals arrived via a different waiter the food was all lukewarm. My chile relleno was so small and unrecognizable I thought they forgot it. It consisted of small flat piece of pepper covered with a tasteless sauce and some sort of cheese. The tamale was cold, filled with unseasoned ground beef and quite tasteless itself. \u00a0We never received our check until we stood up to leave. Then our waiter magically materialized, for the first time since taking our order over an hour earlier. Try any other Mexican restaurant, even Taco Bell, before going here.", 
      "The Fuentes family has extended themselves and this Champaign El Toro location is definitely the best one in town (if you don't have a rapport with individuals at another location that is) , and I usually have a pretty decent experience here. A few notes:The place is fairly big, but the parking lot isn't, so if you pull up and can't find a spot in the lot, you can find some parking on-street parking and will still be able to get a table once you go in...don't quote me though!For the most part the waitstaff's 1st language is Spanglish, so be prepared to talk slow and point to what you want.....I don't think I ever had an issue with lack of communication. Additionally \u00a0they may be a server short at all times as they are always running around trying to serve and do not fully spend as much time at the table to ensure accuracy of orders (especially special orders, etc.). My last experience the food was just alright....maybe a tad bland and lackluster. I usually get the Alambres dish...but strayed this go round....I'd highly suggest trying the Alambres dish to anyone and will probably stick to that. I usually get the mix of steak, chicken, bacon, peppers, and cheese with the usual sides...comes out like fajitas....sizzling and ensuring it'll be nice and hot.The drinks are alright, but I think are a little too expensive for the alcohol content.I think they would benefit from an aggressive happy hour special with extended hours everyday...something to help them stand apart from all of the other competition in town which may have a slight edge in the flavor/authenticity department..Nonetheless, El toro is a solid place to go.", 
      "Pros: Nice ambience, fairly strong margaritas.Cons: The last time I went, the service was not great. \u00a0The waitress got our orders wrong, never refilled our water, and never came back with the salsa we asked for. \u00a0It wasn't busy at all, either. \u00a0The food is just so-so. Everything seemed overcooked and not very thoughtfully seasoned. It's certainly no Mas Amigos or Maize.", 
      "Horrible. \u00a0Very, very Midwestern Mexican. \u00a0(Disclaimer: I grew up in the midwest, but I have traveled and had Mexican and Southwestern food, and I've enjoyed trying the many Mexican themed restaurants in town.) \u00a0Chips were okay - crispy and pretty tasty. \u00a0Salsa was okay. \u00a0Chips and salsa were, probably, the best part of the meal. \u00a0So, +1 star for chips and decent service.My girlfriend wasn't feeling well, and wanted something lighter and got the guacamole salad. \u00a0What she received was a plate of iceberg lettuce, shredded white cheese, and very salty guacamole. \u00a0The guacamole tasted like it came out of a jar. \u00a0The combination was exactly as appetizing as it sounds.I got a burrito plate. \u00a0The burrito was not wrapped up. \u00a0It just had some filling dumped into it and had been shoved into an oven, so the edges of the tortilla had become hard and browned. \u00a0It was impossible to pick up and broke into pieces when I tried. \u00a0The filling itself consisted of stewed, mushy beef with stewed, mushy tomatoes and onions. \u00a0The sides were forgettable. \u00a0 I really hate to throw away leftovers, especially if I think they can be jazzed up somehow, but that's what I ended up doing with the rest of the burrito.You do get a lot of food on your plate, but if it's bland Mexican that's very, very reminiscent of what you can get out of a box at the supermarket, why bother? \u00a0If you'd like better Mexican, try Huaraches Moroleon or Mas Amigos. \u00a0Or Taco Loco. \u00a0Cocina Real and Dos Reales aren't my favorites, but they're still better than here. \u00a0(I haven't been to Maize and can't comment on it.) \u00a0If you wish there was a Burrito King off campus, this is pretty much it. \u00a0Except they do, at least, leave off the salty white cheese sauce here. \u00a0Overall, I would avoid this place and go to one of many places that is cheaper, more charming, and more authentic.", 
      "It's just ok.Salsa was one step up from Pace which isn't really a compliment to the chef. I \u00a0absolutely hate food drenched in sauces to disguise lack of flavor and this was the case with their version of the enchilada.Initially my taco came out in a crunchy tortilla and I was shocked to find out this was the norm when ordering a taco at this place. Since i'm not really into the crunchy taco bell-esque tortilla I kindly asked for a soft corn tortilla (and they gladly changed this for me). The taco was good but again not great.The peach margarita was strong but not really peach so while I got happy from the booze, I wasn't to thrilled at my mystery fruit drink though.Probably won't go back.", 
      "We went here on Taco Tuesday. The tacos were very good. I have eaten here several times over the years and I have always found them to be a good value and good food.", 
      "As a Californian I feel it's unfair for me to review El Toro, which may be just fine for Champaign but would be utterly crushed if it were located anywhere near San Francisco. \u00a0The food wasn't very authentic and I'm not even sure this was as good as a Chevy's.THE ICKY:- The salsa was barely better than salsa you get out of a jar from the supermarket. \u00a0Where are the tomatoes? \u00a0The chips taste similarly store-bought.- The guacamole had no personality... maybe they couldn't get fresh avocados?- The cheese inside the quasadilla tasted really off. \u00a0Were they using American cheese or something?- The tacos from head-to-toe were just not great, from the shell to the meat.THE GOOD:- I did like the horchata. \u00a0:)- Despite the ickiness, I left pretty full, so large portion sizes with reasonable prices.- It had the ambiance of a taqueria, but was cleaner.- Service was fast and efficient.", 
      "I had a great time on my visit. The lobby does still have a new paint smell that was off-putting, and that odor did occaisionaly drift into the dining area, but it did not affect my enjoyment. Despite what other reviewers have noted, I found their menu to be pretty expansive, going far beyond the 'typical Mexican restaurant' fare. The one thing I wanted that they didn't have was a Mole sauce, but most places don't so no big. They had a strong selection of liquor and tequilla, and pretty good drink specials. I enjoyed my enchiladas del mar, and everybody else liked what they got, too. The tamales entree was a hit. They give you warm chips and salsa that is good but pretty mild. I knocked ours up a bit with the Cholula and Tapatio they put on the tables and was sweating gleefully in no time.I wanted to try their Margarona, which is a margarita with a corona stuck into it. I know, it sounds gross to mix beer with liquor, but if it is done right, it can be surprisingly delightful. Holding me back from ordering this frankencocktail was the $8.50 pricetag, but If it were on special, I'd definitely take a Margarona behind the bleachers and deny it later.", 
      "Salsa is not spicy enough. \u00a0But this is by far the best Mexican restaurant in the C-U area that I have been to. \u00a0I had steak tacos and they were delicious", 
      "Four stars for the win, El Toro. \u00a0At last, a place where I can watch the Pumas, eat some decent food, joke in Spanish, and even have fried ice cream if I'm playing gringo tourist. \u00a0I like it. \u00a0And I don't mind taking midwestern friends here. \u00a0It makes me look 'edgy' cuando yo hablo en espanol con la gente. ;)Also, the alambres were fantastic.", 
      "It turns out that El Toro II is the favorite restaurant of one of my best friends, so I started to go there alot recently, and it has grown on me exponentially. \u00a0The service is always amazing: \u00a0the food comes out in like 5 minutes piping hot and exactly as ordered whether the party has 2 people in it or 15. \u00a0I think I have also gotten a handle on what I like to order here too: \u00a0mango margarita (frozen) and three cheese enchiladas.", 
      "They have specials listed on the front of the restaurant, but ask the bartenders as well. \u00a0Each bartender charged differently for their drinks. \u00a0I had some of their pre-mixed lime margaritas on ice. \u00a0I'm not usually a margarita on ice person, but they were pretty tasty. \u00a0HUGE free basket of nachos and salsa as soon as we sat at the bar. I saw large groups, parties, kids, the whole spectrum.", 
      "I have to say I am really excited to have the New El Toro open, because it's only 3 blocks from my house - so smart for them to move closer to both campus and downtown...In the newly renovated warehouse building on the corner of 901 S. Neil (right next door to Kamakura), the restaurant has 6 options for seating (or at least they WILL once the outdoor seating is in place), large, spacious rooms, and good decor. The drinks are strong and generous, the food is fresh and i think MUCH better than the old Neil St Location, quick service, sporting a mixed and interesting crowd of students, yuppies, sport fans at the bar and families.GREAT location, well-designed and reliable, cheap excellent food.", 
      "I'm only giving this 4-stars because I do not want to mislead someone looking for a little bit more of an upscale meal - but fact is, this is absolutely delicious mexican-american and for the food & service I'd give it a 5. \u00a0I love everything I've had on the menu and I love the rice so much I wish I could get the recipe...I don't think I'll ever eat a Mexi rice I love more. \u00a0 Good sized portions - note, if multiple people want a side of rice, just order one....it's massive (did I mention I love the rice?)I've said this about my love for Monical's pizza and same goes for El Toro...I live in ChiCity and have yet to find a (non-fancy or specialty) Mexi place here I like better. \u00a0I'm sure some would say I'm crazy...I don't care! \u00a0YUM!Their service is the FASTEST I've ever seen. \u00a0Which I know could be a good or bad thing depending on what kind of experience you're looking for (again, the 4-star thing) - but if you are HONGARY this is the place. \u00a0Chips and salsa on the table as you sit down. \u00a0Someone ready to take your order/answer questions immediately. \u00a0Water glass never goes empty.And last but not least, so very reasonably priced (I shouldn't say this but it's cheap actually!). \u00a03 of us can eat there for less than $20 and that includes my $3 big margarita!I wouldn't come here as an 'experience' outside of the great food and quick service...meaning you might want to go somewhere else on a first date or with friends if you're looking for atmosphere.Only other thing, is that they can be heavy handed on the salt....", 
      "El Toro is great! \u00a0We came here on a Friday night and while they weren't busy when we arrived, they were able to seat our party of 7 quickly. \u00a0They also allowed us to split our checks 3 ways, which gets a huge PLUS in my book. \u00a0Food and service was excellent. \u00a0I look forward to my next return to El Toro II.", 
      "This is another pretty good Mexican restaurant in the champaign area. It is usually never too busy, so you don't have to wait to be seated. However the service is somewhat slow and not as attentive as I think it should be.The chicken quesadilla is super yummy and definitely worth trying! I also participated in drinking a margorona while there with my friends. They're pretty darn big!! And are as tasty as the ones down in Mexico I will probably visit this restaurant again. Although I wouldn't say it's a place you have to try while in Champaign, it's not a bad place to get dinner with friends on a night out", 
      "So we decided to try out the new El Toro since I had a coupon, and they were open decently late on a Saturday (11 pm). \u00a0The first thing a little odd about the place is that their are 2 entrances, but only 1 is really an entrance; the other you have to walk through the bar area to get to the other entrance to be seated (why not just have 1 entrance then?). The ambiance of the place is pretty nice. \u00a0It's not your stereotypical mexican restaurant, the decor is a lot nicer/classier. Unfortunately, they weren't playing mexican tunes, and instead we got the likes of Miley Cyrus's Party in the USA and Justin Bieber's (OMG!!!) Baby; not really what I'd expect/want to hear in a mexican restaurant. The menu is typical mexican fare; the only thing that annoyed me here was lack of pricing on the drink menu. \u00a0The margaritas are fresh blended, which can be a little annoying sitting close to the bar, and margaritas prepared this way tend to be a lot more liquid than frozen. \u00a0The medium size was on sale for a still expensive ~7 dollars. \u00a0The strength was about average, nothing too impressive. \u00a0So my biggest complaint is the waitress. We were seated right by 2 other tables that she also had, so she walked by us every couple of minutes, but seemed completely oblivious to us. \u00a0We had all ordered water at the start, and we were all out of water well before the time our margaritas came. She didn't notice. \u00a0Not even when she brought our margaritas did she care to ask if we wanted refills. \u00a0Finally, when she did another pass, I asked for a water refill; she only grabbed my glass and refilled it (even though everybody else at the table was also empty). \u00a0So, when she came back, another person at our table asked for a refill. Not getting the hint, she then just grabbed his glass and didn't think to ask anybody else if they wanted refills, luckily the other person at the table spoke up asking for a refill (as a waitress you really should be checking these things). \u00a0Same thing happened with Chips and Salsa; we were empty for the longest time, and only once we asked did we receive some more... unfortunately it must've been the bottom of the bag/basket since they were pretty much all crushed. \u00a0On the plus side, their salsa is definitely the best we've had in the C-U area... the chips weren't quite as good. \u00a0And if this wasn't enough, we also had an issue with our food order. \u00a0One of the guys at our table ordered 3 enchiladas a la carte. \u00a0When our order arrived, he only had 1 enchilada. \u00a0We asked the waitress about it, and she claimed that she thought he had only ordered 1 enchilada. \u00a0But, when she brings us the check, she clearly wrote (and tried to charge us) for the 3 enchiladas. \u00a0Surely, you would check something like this before delivering the bill (or when sending the food order to the kitchen). \u00a0Also, despite the fact that we were clearly 3 unrelated people, there was no offer to split the check. \u00a0I guess I'm giving it 2 stars simply because the food was decent, and this one waitress is hopefully not a reflection of the rest of the wait staff.", 
      "I am going to give this place a five star review for this one dish. I've never seen it anywhere else. I've never tried anything else here because of the unbelievable awesomeness packed into it.What is this tasty tasty dish you speak of? Pollo Amables. It's essentially the chicken and veggies that would be in a fajita, but they're covered in cheese and saut\u00e9ed with bacon. YES BACON! in Mexican food. Go and order it, it's awesome,I had a margarita, I ordered the cheap one and it tasted ok, and it was super strong. Spend the money for the upgrade for the better booze", 
      "I lived in Champaign for about 8 years and just moved back to Chicago this summer. \u00a0I miss El Toro more than words can describe. \u00a0Outstanding and fast service, great prices, and delicious food. \u00a0My husband and I loved El Toro so much we had our rehearsal dinner there, and our priest mentioned El Toro in our wedding homily. \u00a0I miss you Toro. :(", 
      "Tasty salsa, great prices, quick service. If he wasn't so amusing, I might have been put off by the frazzled older guy who was our waiter. He seemed to misunderstand my friend's margarita order(he ended up with a mondo sized one), couldn't quite grasp what I was saying when I said that we needed another set of siverware...but he did swiftly refill my beverage--no matter if he gave me water, when I was drinking Diet Pepsi. We all got a laugh from that(including him). He brought me a replacement fizzy beverage, but left the glass that now looked like dirty pond water. My Carne Asada was overdone and lacking flavor, but the other items in my platter were okay. Next time, I'm trying that Fajita Quesadilla, that Heather T. was lobbying for. Looked great!", 
      "I was all excited about El Toro moving closer to my house...and then I went there. \u00a0For lunch. \u00a0At 1pm on a Sunday. \u00a0And there was absolutely ZERO parking. \u00a0One of the nice things about the old El Toro was the humongous parking lot--even when it was packed with people inside, there was always a place to park. \u00a0Irritating, but I was willing to look past it.The new El Toro is, in a word, cavernous. \u00a0Where the old one was cavernous-but-packed-like-sardines sort of way, this one is just full of space. \u00a0It's nice that you're not all up on the table next to you. \u00a0When paired with the shellacked, corporate decor of the new location, however, the ambiance is sorely lacking. \u00a0I felt like I was eating at a big, faceless Mexican restaurant that you would find in a suburb of Madison or some other larger city. \u00a0It was just...personality-less.This is not to mention that they have changed up the menu. \u00a0I loved their salsa for the garlicky flavor, but what I was served did not taste the same anymore. \u00a0One of my friends always gets some sort of chicken nachos, and he said that this, too, was different. \u00a0Sad.That said, El Toro still has ginormous portions on the cheap, and I'm sure the booze still works. \u00a0The service is still uber-efficient and attentive (you'll get new baskets of chips so fast your head will spin). \u00a0I think I'll give another location a try next time, though.", 
      "Well the atmosphere is excellent - especially in CU. The staff was all very friendly and attentive. Kudos to them!The food was a bit better than average but nothing to knock your socks off. A good place to go with family or friends.They have a cheese sauce that is a bit spicy but tasty!", 
      "In a lot of ways, El Toro is your typical Mexican-American restaurant--same options on the menu, same cheap prices, same piles of free chips and salsa. \u00a0The things that make it even more worth checking out:-Great service, even in massive groups with complicated ticket-splitting and lots of different drink orders-The fajita quesadilla is particularly delicious, only $8, and huge enough to eat half for dinner and half for lunch the next day-Gigantic margaritas for cheap every Thursday! \u00a0Try the strawberry-banana, but they'll mix anything up for you.Overall--not particularly authentic Mexican food, but definitely one of the better Mexican-American places in town.", 
      "You want good Mexican food in Champaign, then you've gotta go to El Toro! It's not quite in the heart of campus but close enough! Make sure you ask for the white cheese dip with the chips to start, amazing! The rest of the food was delicious, the Margaritas were strong and massive, and the service was great. The only reason I took away a star was because we made a reservation and then had to still wait at the bar for about a half hour before being seated.", 
      "This is mediocre, inexpensive American-style Mexican food. It's not terrible, but it's definitely nothing to write home about.", 
      "I went here with two co-workers for lunch. \u00a0We were under a time crunch and were worried when we saw all the cars in the parking lot. \u00a0We walked in and were seated immediately. \u00a0The server (unfortunately I did not get her name) quickly got our drinks and food orders. \u00a0Our food arrived very quickly, and we were finished in no time. \u00a0Our server even took our bills for us so we would not have to wait at the register with all the other people who were leaving.As far as the food, I was pleased with mine. \u00a0I got the lunch special number 3 (enchilada and taco with beans and rice). \u00a0It was on par with what I expected. \u00a0One of my co-workers got a bean burrito. \u00a0She was pretty sure the sauce on the burrito was pizza sauce, and that seemed a little weird.I will keep this in mind the next time I only have a few minutes for lunch. \u00a0I think we were in and out in about 30 minutes.", 
      "The last time I was there, there was a cockroach crawling on my table. The cockroach then climbed onto a stand up menu. We pointed it out to the waiter and he took the menu and threw it on the floor and tried to stomp on the cockroach. We mentioned to the woman at the check out section that there was a cockroach and she gave us 10% off our order. She told me that they had recently sprayed for them, but apparently they were still a problem. She was very apologetic. It's a real shame because the food is not half bad. And many of the people who work there are quite nice. But I don't think I'll be eating there any time soon again...", 
      "Oh El Toro, how I love you!I've been a loyal patron at the El Toro on South Neil for five years, eating there at least once a month--and usually once a week in the summer. \u00a0Sitting on their patio getting schnockered on margaritas is a fabulous way to spend a summer day, and, oh yeah, the food is awesome. \u00a0When they mentioned they were moving, I was understandably nervous.I shouldn't have worried. \u00a0Their new building, freshly renovated, is gorgeous--and only two blocks from my house. \u00a0(Can you say 'stumbling-distance'?) \u00a0The bar area has less seating, but over all, the seating seems to have expanded. \u00a0The d\u00e9cor is much more understated and less kitschy, which makes the whole place seem classier. \u00a0The outdoor seating area hasn't opened yet, but it looks fabulous, with several glass doors separating it from the inside, so even if you prefer to eat indoors, you can still enjoy the summer sun with your margarita.The food is consistently good and very fast, and the margaritas are strong. \u00a0It's no longer on the menu (the owner told me they are redoing the daily specials), but the Paisa Burritos are delish. \u00a0You can't really go wrong with chorizo-stuffed tortillas slathered in cheese sauce! \u00a0I also tried something new: a Margarona. \u00a0It's a frozen margarita with a bottle of Corona up-ended into it. \u00a0Trust me, it tastes better than it sounds, and it looks really bad-ass.Two small nitpicks: a distinct lack of parking during lunch--after 5 you can park across Williams Street at Bacon & Van Buskirk--and during the busy times (Saturday nights, for example) the food and service is much slower than at their old location. \u00a0I hope this is just them working out a few kinks in the kitchen and they'll return to their speedy service in time for me setting up camp on the patio this summer!", 
      "The absolute best thing about this place and a reason I would go back.... The Margaritas.Best margaritas I have ever had. \u00a0Lots of flavors (though the original lime is the best) and STRONG. \u00a0They really load these drinks with the tequila, and I like it. \u00a0I honestly would go here just to grab a margarita. As for the rest of the deal, the restaurant is huge inside, clean, and nicely designed/decorated. \u00a0The service was good. \u00a0The food though was very bland. \u00a0I only went once so maybe it was just a bad night, but my parties and my entrees all looked delicious, but tasted very bland. \u00a0Even the salsa, chips, and other dips were all really bland. \u00a0I never knew that food that looked so good could be so bland. \u00a0 I probably would not go back again for the food.Definitely check this place out though for the margaritas, you won't be disappointed.", 
      "If I could I would give them 5 stars on their salsa and chips...but I have to take the whole dining experience into account. \u00a0I really liked their food. \u00a0Their service was wonderful. \u00a0I was there for my daughter's rehersal dinner and they did a great job accomadating about 30 of us. \u00a0Then did an awsome job embarrasing the bride and groom by making them stand up and singing something to them...don't know what they were singing because it was in spanish. \u00a0The parking is horrible.", 
      "El Toro is not horrible, but its not great Mexican either. Don't let this reflect on \u00a0Wedge. There are no better margaritas in CU than Wedge's. We got nachos and a chicken verde quesadilla. The nachos had cheese sauce instead of cheese. Not our thing, but the sour cream and guac were super fresh so that made up for it. The quesadilla was soggy and wet and lacking cheese. I didn't hate it but my boyfriend wouldn't take a second bite. Overall it's acceptable, but there are better Mexican places if you look elsewhere.", 
      "Casual atmosphere, fast and friendly service. Food was really good. \u00a0Salsa was chunky if u like that and guacamole was made fresh."

      "This place has great food. \u00a0Its all priced really reasonably. We've only gotten take out. \u00a0The salsa is hot though. \u00a0All of it. \u00a0The vegetarian options are really great. I'm glad we have a fantastic Mexican food option in Urbana.I'm hoping to try their breakfast sometime. Some of the Urbana fire fighters go there (I've seen the trucks outside frequently), so I'm assuming its pretty good.", 
      "Huaraches offers a large variety of entrees and is extremely tasty for the price. This is definitely one of the top mexican restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area, along with Maize. They give HUGE horchatas and I would definitely recommend getting one!My only complaint is that it takes WAY too long to get your bill at the end of the meal. I can confirm this because I've eaten here multiple times. There is only one waiter who serves for an entire restaurant that's always packed, so be prepared to wait just as long as you did to get a seat to wait for your receipt. Dinner lengths here are double what they would be anywhere else simply because of this understaffing issue.", 
      "Always love this place! Try their lunch special with 2 beef enchiladas, 1 chicken taco, and rice and beans ($6.99). Delicious! Their chips are a little on the greasy side, but they're still addicting. Yummy sauces to accompany them. Try this little place!", 
      "Huaraches is definitely the most delicious Mexican food I've had in cu, get the carnitas or the skillets for breakfast, so good!", 
      "Hands down the best Mexican in CU. The chips and salsa's are great. Very chunky and delicious guacamole.", 
      "We have previously loved this place, but our last visit, on Sunday evening, was less than great. Service was a bit slow initially, but the real problem was a very messed up order. Ordered cheese dip, didn't get it. Two of our 4 meals had MINOR adjustments (add cheese, no onion) that weren't made. When I ask them to fix it, the response is, \"you're gonna have to wait a few minutes.\" When my meal comes back, it doesn't have onion, or two other ingredients that were supposed to be on it. Chip basket went empty the whole meal. Never did get the bill--finally just went to the register, where I also had to ask for the carryout boxes. Service matters to us, and they're going to have to do better on an almost $50 meal if they want us to keep coming back.", 
      "Off the beaten path and as authentic as it gets! As a veteran road warrior this was a great find. Liked it so much made a return visit the next evening with a group of coworkers. The Carnitas are the real deal!Crispy and juicy not dried out like some places.", 
      "This is a local 5. It is really the only legit Mexican place around. Sorry Maize, you have good ingredients, but your burritos are wrapped too loosely and they are small. Huaraches has an authentic taste, great ingredients, and I haven't had anything bad from here. The side of nachos with jalape\u00f1os and ballpark nacho cheese threw me off the first time, but now I think it's charming. Now, compared to other areas, this might be a 4, but around here I think this is really the only game in town.", 
      "I like this place. As a number of other people have mentioned, the chips and salsa are great. The horchata is also delicious and they give you free refills (utter madness but I love it). However, it wasn't the best mexican I've had, not even close to the top 5. For whatever reason, I was craving enchiladas. They did not turn out well. The sauce that came on the enchilada tasted like it was from a can. just terrible. My girlfriend's meal was much better. She had two steak tacos that looked pretty tasty. She really enjoyed \u00a0her meal. I'll be back to see if they just misfired on the enchiladas.Update: I came back and ordered the fish tacos. they were not good. won't be back.", 
      "The carnitas are the best I have ever had. \u00a0This is some seriously tender and perfectly slow cooked pork. \u00a0It was crispy in some parts, soft in others and downright flavorful all around! \u00a0My only question is why can't any of the Mexican restaurants in the Chicago area make food half as tasty as these guys? \u00a0I can't drive out to Urbana every weekend...", 
      "Stumbled upon this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Doesn't look like much outside and only has 11 tables inside. Appears carry out is big for them. We ate in and were very excited at the list of authentic dishes and options on the menu. My sister had a veggie dish with cactus as the 'meat' and She LOVED it! My alpastor carcinitos(??) was excellent. My daughter loved the chicken tacos. We will be back!!", 
      "Thought it doesn't look great on the outside, Huaraches Moroleon is cozy and charming inside, with friendly staff and authentic smells and tastes. I ordered a huarache, carry-out, which I have never tried before. It was a corn-based shell containing steak, cheese, lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and pineapple (!), if memory serves me correctly. The sweetness of pineapple in this fried concoction added a really nice touch. Some places place too much meat on the food, others have too many toppings, or use too much oil. The huarache was a bit on the greasy side, but overall it was balanced. The sauces they provided, too, tasted homemade, and I didn't remember how unique they were until I saw some of the other reviews here. I was quite pleased with the meal, and would definitely stop by again.", 
      "Great place! \u00a0The chips are awesome and so is the rest of the food. \u00a0It's a tiny restaurant, somewhat of a \"hole in the wall\" but the food is delicious! \u00a0Best Mexican in town! \u00a0Parking is very limited and so is seating", 
      "Best in town! Friendly and attentive service. One of my favorite places to eat in the area.", 
      "Had a great lunch today. Ordered a bunch of food. Mole chicken enchiladas (4per order) and a spicy burrito. Awesome and awesome! Enough said. I'll try the dish that they are named after during my next visit. Yum and Yum.", 
      "It took me a long time to stop by this place, but now that I live a block away, I'm there all the time! Great drink selection, and their margaritas aren't too sweet or too sour - just right. \u00a0Their fish taco's are freakin' amazing. The only thing I have against this place is that all their salsas are spicy (and I'm a weakling when it comes to spice). But! They are redeemed by their queso dip - top of it's class. You'll see me here all the time - moreso once they put out their patio seating!", 
      "The best Mexican food in Champaign-Urbana. \u00a0Everything is fresh and delicious. \u00a0I especially like the Shrimp a la Diablo, fish tacos, and unique breakfast items, such as the tilapia omelet. \u00a0When the owner can get fresh habaneros, the habaneros sauce is fantastic, striking a delicate balance between bringing out the flavor of the pepper without overpowering your taste buds with heat. \u00a0However, since he believes in quality, if high quality ingredients aren't available, neither will the sauce. If you want good, solid, unpretentious real Mexican food, this is the place for you.", 
      "It's not bad. The highlight of Huaraches Moreleon (and what keeps us coming back more than anything else) is definitely their homemade chips and the three sauces they bring out with them. Molto bene! I mean, muy bueno! Whatever. They're pretty good.The best entree they make is the Aver Si Puede (\"See if You Can\"), which is basically a gigantic plate of meat with some rice and beans thrown in the middle in case you were in need of inferior sources of protein to feel like you're eating Mexican food. It feeds two large people or a small family of small people. Their basic enchilada sauce is not much more than watered-down tomato sauce. The mole sauce is ok. The chipotle sauce on the Enchiladas Suizas is probably the best I've had thus far. Still, even the worst enchiladas are pretty decent.I like the breakfast skillets. Don't order soup.I have not had good experiences with their more \"exotic\" offerings such as tripas or lengua tacos. Either the chef does not know how to make them, or the ingredients are poor. Superior tripas tacos can be found on literally any taco truck operating in the area between Santa Monica and Houston, TX. Go to Huaraches, but avoid these menu items.Oh, the prices are reasonable, and the service is typically fast unless you order the more \"exotic\" offerings I mentioned.The food is great for the area, but it still doesn't hold a candle to most Mexican food in the Southwest. For that I have to give it four out of five stars. But you should still go. This is a small, fledgling place, and it deserves your custom.", 
      "Huaraches Moroleon is the best and closest thing to real Mexican Food! The food is fresh and made great!", 
      "I used to live up the street when this building housed Sweet Betsy's, then Skully's, then Fin-N-Feather. Since we've moved I haven't had occasion to drive by very frequently, but I was pleased to see a new place here that finally looked like it might have a chance to stay. I've been eyeing it for a while, and finally happened to be by today at lunch and stopped in. I am so glad I did, and I'll be finding a reason to head over that direction again soon.The carnitas huarache was fantastic. Really flavorful carnitas: \u00a0juicy and tender with a great char outside. The huarache itself was tasty, and the cheese was great too - not that plastic stuff you get most places. It came with a little bag of perfectly fried, thin and crispy chips and 3 salsas that ranged from fruity to spicy. I wasn't a huge fan of any of the salsas in all honesty, but the huarache more than made up for it.There are 3 tables that seat 4 and a couple of tables for 2, plus some counter seating. I don't think that building has ever been so sparkling and clean, even way back when it was Sweet Betsy's years ago. They obviously did a lot of work in there. The service was quick and friendly too.", 
      "I am sad to see Fin-n-feather go, which was the previous restaurant at \u00a0this location. \u00a0They had my favorite fried fish in town..But I decided to make the best of it and try the new place. \u00a0I've now been twice, very pleased each time. \u00a0My girlfriend and I have tried the carnitas huarache, a torta alpastor special, the tongue tacos, and the carnitas burrito. \u00a0They've all been great. \u00a0Fresh vegetables and flavorful, tender meat.The huarache came with a grilled pineapple to put on it. \u00a0I was a little skeptical but it was delicious. \u00a0Everything comes with cilantro and onion, and most come with lettuce and tomato. \u00a0Our take-out meals came with a bag of fresh fried chips and three little plastic containers of sauce - one salsa verde, one fruity salsa, and one more spicy orange salsa. \u00a0They were all excellent. \u00a0(The second time we went, the chips were a little more greasy, but they had definitely been recently fried.)They're fast on take-out, and if they stay this good, it may be hard to eat in at one of the tables.My only complaint is that they do not have horchata at the moment.My two favorite places for Mexican in town now are Mas Amigos and this place - and both are excellent. \u00a0The prices on most entrees is around $6-7 - which is actually comparable to what it costs to get enough fast food to fill us up. \u00a0Between Chipotle, Taco Bell, or here, the choice is clear.", 
      "Authentic Mexican cuisine. Pretty good flavors. The pork al pastor leaves something to be desired. The salsa options are a huge plus.Clean place.Friendly staff.Cheap and fast.Certainly one of the best restaurants in Urbana, for whatever that's worth.", 
      "My first ever yelp review and it has to go to Huaraches Moroleon! I love this place so much! Not only my favorite Mexican spot, but one of my top 5 favorite Urbana restaurants.-Staff is friendly and accommodating-The chips are so fresh and crispy and delicious-They have a separate VEGETARIAN MENU!!! I've been to lots of Mexican restaurants and have never seen that. It has some delicious unique options like CACTUS fajitas and a nice fresh salad with pineapple chunks, cactus, veggies, pico de gallo, and beans-I always skip the cheese and sour cream to make stuff VEGAN and let me tell you, with all of the fresh flavors, I don't miss the dairy at all!-The sauces! Oh my, they bring out 3 bottles of house-made sauces to the table with the chips, and those sauces.....the green is my favorite and the smoky red comes in a close second!!!-The guacamole is fresh and just as yummy as guac can be-Also it's always an awesome value-Did I mention they have a full breakfast menu too??!-I could go on and on but I will stop now. Can't wait til my next visit!", 
      "This is the best Mexican restaurant in Urbana, for sure. Sorry Maize, but you have no soul. The salsas are what makes this place special. The first is an orange-colored creamy chipotle salsa, the second is a green creamy salsa made with tomatillos and avocado, and the last one is a light, smokey flavored dark red salsa. Carne asada or the barbacoa are great on tacos or sopes. The al pastor is a little too greasy. If you go here please get anything but a burrito: burritos are NOT Mexican. You're missing out if you go for a burrito here. And get your tacos with cilantro and onion. None of that lettuce cheese tomato.", 
      "Wow- DO NOT miss this one. I've had mexican food all over the southwestern US- including Arizona and southern california- and I would consider it truly special. Proud to have a such a genuine eatery as part of the local community! Good people, fantastic food, and now they have mexican beers, including the red label Bohemia. What a breath of fresh air!", 
      "Came here for dinner recently, and I was happy with my experience. The staff is friendly and attentive, and you're provided with a free basket of chips and salsas (3 types, all spicy) when you're seated. Between the chips and the two tacos I ordered (at $1.90 each), I was full. The chips are filling, so be prepared to take home leftovers if you order a big entree. The al pastor was a good balance of fat and meat, and the carnitas was a bit dry but still tasty. I also ordered a glass of horchata (not on the menu), and thought it was perfectly spiced and milky.", 
      "Still great. \u00a0Carnitas tacos are probably the best in town (only been to Maize once, though). \u00a0My husband and I had a horrible realization one night when we got Taco Bell and only afterwards realized it was $1 taco night at Huaraches. \u00a0Noooooooo, worst decision ever! \u00a0In summary, Taco Bell is awful and not even that cheap anymore. \u00a0Go to Huaraches instead.", 
      "Very good mexican food in my neighborhood! \u00a0Huraches, sopes, and specials every day. Four types of salsa brought with chips to start the meal.", 
      "Yummy! We didn't know what to expect when we pulled up at this little, tiny, yellow place but it surprised us (in a positive way!)! First time we had huaraches and we absolutely loved them. The owner/cashier was really speedy and promptly delivered our food. Only weird thing was that the Sangria actually wasn't sangria (it was non-alcoholic). The three different salsas were fun.", 
      "We ate there last night. \u00a0Noticed the outside looks inviting. \u00a0Nice comfortable booths and tables inside. \u00a0It's small but that's what so charming about the place. \u00a0The option of 3 sauces with your chips is totally amazing. \u00a0I tried them all and ended up mixing them. \u00a0I just wonder what happens to them after people are done??? \u00a0are they recycled??? \u00a0The waiter was attentative and the food was very flavorful, too. Very large soft drinks. \u00a0 Hand made items. \u00a0I think it cost a little over $20 for two adults.", 
      "Excellent food -- probably the best mexican restaurant in the area. This place is not a tex-mex place and so you won't find greasy refried beans and cheese, and sour cream. Their huaraches are amazing and they have this cactus dish (name escapes me) which is also fantastic and quite healthy. They always 4-5 different kinds of salsas which change every time I visit.On top of that, this place is very cheap.", 
      "Excellent Mexican food, great service and prices that can't be beat! A trio of salsas with home made chips when you sit down, and the huaraches are to die for! I really hope this place makes it.", 
      "Really, really yummy. Looks like a hole in the wall from the outside and limited seating but friendly service and DELICIOUS food. Homemade chips w/ 4 salsas. The beans they serve are delicious, as is the rice. Make sure to check the specials on the board behind the cash register. It can be easy to miss but usually has some yummy options. The chocolate cake is definitely for 2 people and not cheap but soooo yummy. Also good horchata.Guacamola is also not cheap but straight outta the avocado fresh and enough for 4 probably.", 
      "the free chips and salsas are the bomb!", 
      "The food was awesome! \u00a0I had the three tacos: \u00a0chorizo, chicken and ground beef. \u00a0The taco shells were super fresh and I love that they provided the lime wedges to give everything that extra fresh taste. \u00a0The torillas were excellent as well. \u00a0They worked very hard to revamp this place it looks totally different and the decor is very nice. \u00a0Small and like a previous reviewer stated, if they stay consistent with this quality, it will be hard to find a seat. \u00a0Much like It is hard to get a set at Black Dog. \u00a0We will be taking the kids very soon.", 
      "Okay, this is a storefront type restaurant, so the tacky d\u00e9cor can be forgiven. \u00a0What can't be forgiven is the filth. \u00a0The dining area is smaller than my living room which means there is no excuse for not keeping it clean. \u00a0The ceiling fans were caked with dust and grit as were many of the surfaces. \u00a0The floor was filthy. \u00a0Come on, guys, that place could be cleaned daily in less than 15 minutes. If the public area is that way, one can imagine what is in the kitchen. \u00a0I took my food home, opened the box, was craving Mexican food, but could not get myself to eat any of it, thinking of the general filth of the dining area and its implications for the kitchen. \u00a0I like seeing little places like this succeed, so I hope that someone decides to start cleaning this place on a regular basis. \u00a0No one likes clumps of dust dropping into their food from a neglected ceiling fan or wondering what the hygiene is in the kitchen.", 
      "Off the beaten path Mexican. When the basket of chips came out there were three sauces to choose from and a salsa. \u00a0I had the house special. Huaraches, I believe, with al pastor, that would be the grilled pork and it was good. \u00a0I liked the grilled pineapple garnish.", 
      "Oh my goodness, oh my goodness! \u00a0This place is fabulous! \u00a0This location has had a lot of restaurants occupy it, but this Mexican restaurant is to die for! \u00a0I was the only one there.... They had a few specials on the board and I saw fish tacos (3) for $5.99. \u00a0I ordered those and a mexican coke. \u00a0I sat down at one of the nice booths (restaurant easily seats 30+) and the nice waitress brought out a generous portion of chips and four salsas. \u00a0There was a mild, spicy, green and another medium/mild. \u00a0The chips were warm and crunchy. \u00a0Almost finished the basket! \u00a0The fish tacos came out soon after and they were great! \u00a0The fish was lightly breaded and fried.... I wish they were grilled, but I didn't ask.... There was a generous mound of onions, cilantro, cabbage and a mayonaise based drizzle on top! \u00a0They were great! \u00a0I also got a mexican coke.... It came out warm, but drinking warm coke reminds me of my grandparents...they used to serve us warm coke so it was nostalgic for me.... I bet it would bother a lot of other people.... But anyways, the bill came out to about $8.60. \u00a0 Not bad! \u00a0 I would say that this place would give Maize a run for its money.... They have a lot more seating and the food is just as good if not better. \u00a0Too bad it's waaay out in Urbana...They're also open for breakfast.... \u00a0I will definitely be back to try some other things!! \u00a0I hope they don't fall suit to the prior restaurants at this location....that would be a terrible loss.", 
      "I hate to give this place a bad review, because the first time I went, it was delicious! The guacamole is great and the service is friendly. However, the last time I went it was so terrible that I don't think I'll be going back again. The server informed me that it was $1 tacos, so obviously that's a deal, but they were so bad that I couldn't even eat them. I got three different kinds, all of which tasted like burnt, old meat, topped with slimy cilantro and onion-- no tomato, lettuce, cheese, or sour cream-- which was confusing to me, since my friend had ordered hard tacos and had gotten the listed toppings. Her hard shells tasted stale! I filled up on tons of guacamole and chips and salsa, but I feel like their food quality has gone down since opening.", 
      "The carnitas huaraches were excellent....different for me, but I enjoy new foods. The chips that came with the salsas were too oily for my taste. Margarita was strong and flavorful. Will be back to try other menu items. Worth having your phone handy to search any food terms you may be unfamiliar with......"

      "Came from Texas...and stumbled on Thara Thai...DELICIOUS and very friendly, their is only waitress and she is super awesome and courteous!!!I am for 2 months and I have been coming on the weekends...it's worth palate!!!! Enjoy...", 
      "The taste is 5 star. I love their Thai style pho! However, it's a mom and pop shop with unsystemized service. When there's too many people crowding in they don't do a good job of serving. If they would only hire ONE more server things could/would get better. Their combination fried rice is also good. Can't go wrong with that choice either. Stay away, however, from the spicest options. I can do spicy very well, but not their max spicy pho option.On Mondays and any random they of their choosing, the restaurant can be closed. So call before you go eat. ^^", 
      "I don't eat at any other Thai place. I've been to most of the other ones in town and this is my favorite. Yes, depending on who is working or if it's busy it may take a while to get food here. It is a bit more expensive, but sometimes I think you all forget that people are trying to make a living here. It's family owned and this is all they've got. C'mon give them a break. I love the Thai iced coffee and the Thai iced tea. Chicken Pad Thai is my go to when I can't decide what to eat. I also love the beef pho. I always have them add meatballs to mine. I also like the Panang curry. I've never had a dish here that I didn't like. The appetizers here are not really my thing, but if you do get some, get the shumai.", 
      "Sushi is terrible that it only contains sour flavor, no sweet taste. I hope I'll have chance to taste other food here since my friend would never visit this place anymore.", 
      "Where do I start? The wait here is very long. The food portions are very small. The pricey of the food is extremely expensive. The quality of the meat, seafood is poor. The overall taste of the food is rubbish. I wish I tasted more for what I paid for but not. Typical food in this city. Overpriced. Over-hyped.", 
      "Sitting here since 30 mins. The guy doesn't even take a look. Told him that we are ready with the order and he doesn't even come back.Saw the reviews were good and thought of trying it out. I won't recommend this place of you have time constraint because it will be atleast 40-45 minutes before you come and get the order on your table.", 
      "Awesome Thai! I used to go to Schaumburg, IL just to get this amazing Thai food and now I can just drive 30 minutes! So good!", 
      "The food is fine, but it doesn't warrant the high prices. I took one star off because even though the quality of the food is comparable to other casual sit-down Thai restaurants in C-U, the prices are about $3 higher per dish. The service was also a bit slow. I was here for lunch with a small group, with the restaurant nearly empty, and it still took around 30 minutes for our meals to come. I'm happy that all the food is made to order, but it seemed like a long time given there was such a slow stream of customers. I ordered one of my favorites, the green papaya salad, and it was totally fine, but not extraordinary enough to warrant the weirdly high price ($10 as compared to $7 or so at most other Thai places). The fairly generous portion made the $12 blow to my wallet a bit more palatable. I had the pad thai lunch special on my other visit, and though it was cheaper than the dinner price for pad thai, it was still around $8, which is closer to the dinner price you'd pay for the dish at most Thai places in town.They are good about adjusting spiciness to your preference. I like things pretty spicy, and they gave me pretty much exactly what I asked for. The staff was also very friendly, which is always pleasant.", 
      "I've been coming to Thara Thai for the past 2 years. This is by far the most amazing Thai place in Chambana. In fact I'd go as far to say it's some of the best Thai food I've had period. My go to dish is the Panang curry (medium spicy). The house special fried rice is also really great. The food has always been on point and consistent. I love the mom and pop atmosphere of this place. The wait staff and family are very friendly. I'd recommend everyone give Thara Thai a chance, I promise you will not be disappointed.", 
      "The food was good and the service was decent. The staff was friendly, but pretty slow. I got the Nuea Numtok, which was a beef salad (I really liked this dish, better than \"good\" not quite \"great\"), and the Garlic Pepper Stir Fried with chicken which was good. I also tried some of the Basil Duck and Papaya Salad. Both of those dishes were good. Besides the Nuea Numtok, I described all the food as \"good\" because nothing was spectacular or amazing and nothing was bad either. The portion sizes were pretty decent too (better than a lot of other restaurants where I leave hungry).I think three stars is the perfect rating for this place. Nothing spectacular, but the food is good. If you're in the area and in the mood for Thai food, then definitely check it out, but otherwise there is no need to go out of your way to try this place.", 
      "The food was nice. Fresh lettuce and herbs on the yum salad. they use fresh ginger in the dishes! The beef was tender and moist. the tasty chocolate fortune cookies are a pleasant surprise.", 
      "I hate how long it took me to find Thai food. I know that there are numerous thai restaurants in Chicago, but I had been limited to the suburbs and DeKalb, until finding Thara in Champaign. I love Thai food, i.e. grownup chinese food. It tastes better and fresher in my opinion. At Thara Thai, you will not be disappointed by anything.I arrived here with my brother after he had been raving about this place. The best Thai I had ever had was Thai Pavillion, located in DeKalb, Illinois. Sorry TP, you have been bumped!We got here around 7:50 on a Saturday night. The restaurant is located right off of 74, and could be easily missed. It's surrounded by McDonalds and gas stations. The exterior is not great, but the interior is calm and inviting. After being seated, it took a while to get our drinks, but after that, the service was smooth sailing. My brother ordered the Seafood pad thai. I decided on the See Eiw pad thai, which was a special. Basically, it is your standard pad thai, but instead of thin rice noodles, it came with wide rice noodles, which I prefer. We also decided to split the basil stir fried vegetable dish.Our food was promptly delivered in 12 minutes, which was a surprise because my brother had said on his previous visits that the service was a bit slow, but the food was very good. In my case, both were amazing!The basil vegetables were excellent. I was debating on whether to get Kee Mao as my main course, but by splitting this dish, all my taste buds were satisfied (Kee Mao is cooked in a basil garlic sauce, just like the vegetable dish we split). As for my Chicken See Eiw pad thai... simple amazing. The noodles were stirfried along with the veggies, and all were very fresh. I ordered my dish mild, because I'm just not a spicy guy. I would have preferred more chicken, but I would have received less noodles, so I was fine with it. My bro gave me a piece of his shrimp, and it was awesome as well (this coming from a guy who hates seafood, and I'm just trying to get over my fear of eating it).I will say that I was disappointed that my dish was not garnished with lime, carrots, or cabbage, which is usually a staple of the pad thai dish. But that's definitely not enough to take off a star.Our total was 44 and change. My bro went with a very expensive dish (10.99 + 5 for seafood). I had the 12.99 special, and we split a 9.99 entree. Not bad, but a little pricey for a budget. The lunch special looks like a good deal, and apparently it is the same size as dinner, so I would do that to be more friendly to my wallet!My new favorite thai place. Too bad it's 2 hours away! that won't stop me... As Arnold said... I'LL BE BACK.", 
      "I have lived in many place and have had some very good Thai food. This rates at the top. This family owned place was very busy however the family's team work made our lunch seamless. Everything tasted fresh. The flavors were great . I'll be back !!!", 
      "Went here with mom after she came down to Central Illinois to visit me! As a teacher...school is out for summer (as my principal sang on the announcements yesterday) so my culinary horizons will be expanding in Central IL. I love Papa Del's and Original Pancake House. LITTLE DID I KNOW THIS GEM WOULD BE AMONG my cannot miss list while in the area!We arrived and the restaurant was half filled. We got to pick where to sit (rather than have to wait like those who arrived as we were leaving). My mother and I noticed that we were in the minority (IE Caucasian). She was correct in her assumption that that is how \"you know it's good\". The restaurant was filled with 20 somethings eating their pho, pad thai, and other Asian dishes.I noticed that their prices are a little high, but their portions are GIGANTIC!!!!! Case in point: they have a list of appetizers like satay, shumai, and dumplings that are priced like other places. But their salads (we ordered a shrimp salad) and soups come in such large bowls that they are similarly priced to entree and noodle dishes. The bowls are gigantic. For you Seinfeld fans out there, soup is not a meal, so I knew we had some noodles in our future. I will say that this restaurant is located next to a questionable motel. Well, it is worth the \"walk of shame\", drug ring, or murder that is going on here while you dine. The restaurant is so small and unassuming. Well guess what!? Quality and flavor are not small here!I decided since I hate ordering the same thing as people I dine with (mom got the Pad Thai Chicken mild), I would go with the 13.99 priced Egg Noodle Pad Thai. It was very close to Chinese lo mein. It was delicious. If I could go back I would order what my mother had for $3 less. I ordered off the Thara Special Noodle menu while mommy kept it simple with her order. It was defintely spicier They also give you the option of mild, medium, or spicy which I thought was great. I stay away from fried food when dining out but this was fantastic!My only gripe with this place is the prices! With our salad, we asked for dressing on the side but I was an idiot and didn't even read the menu! The waitress came by and was nice enough to explain that the dressing was always made with the salad and there was nothing on the side. Oops on my part!So what if they charge a ton of money for gigantic portions? I couldn't believe how many Asians were in this place when we arrived. They must love how it is \"close to what mom makes\", which is what I asked a girl dining on her PHO!They must have to charge a little more for their specialty dishes to keep the drug dealers, hookers, and pimps out from next store. The second time I went back I went for the standard Chicken Pad Thai or Pad Thai Chicken (you can say it both ways...I specifically asked...hooray learning while dining). This is the best place I've found in Champaign for lunch or dinner. I love Papa Del's, but I'd take Thara Thai eight days a week!", 
      "Food is great! much better than Green street Thai. But.. we were charged $2 for a cup of instant hot tea? common..it should be free", 
      "Updating the review to give 4 stars just because their veggie fried rice and pho are tooooo amazing for just 3 stars.", 
      "Mama Thai Noodle Soup. \u00a0Yum. \u00a0These guys do everything well - never had a bad meal at Thara Thai. \u00a0It's definitely a hole in the wall kind of place, but hands down the best Thai in CU.", 
      "This poor place is suffering from an identity crisis. Situated on Bloomington Road next to a motel that's frequented by drug addicts and prostitutes, this place has excellent food and warm and friendly servers.But on the day we were there the servers were wearing old blue jeans and hoodie sweatshirts and yet the prices were above average for this community. It has the look and feel of a motel diner but the prices of an upscale cloth tablecloth place.And they lost a star for committing the cardinal sin of restaurants. They took over one booth near the door and used it as a workstation for the help. It was covered with McDonald's food, a deck of cards, a box of crayons, and a pile of receipts that they were apparently tabulating for their tax return.The food is excellent, but I wouldn't bring somebody there who you were trying to impress.", 
      "\"So where do you want to eat tonight, since you're the visitor?\" Nathan asked as we piled into the car. \u00a0\"Um, I have no freaking clue,\" I said uncertainly. \u00a0\"How about Asian food?\"\"We could take you to the most decent Thai place in the area,\" Anna suggested.\"Most Decent Thai? \u00a0That's teh best name ever!\" \u00a0And so began a delightful culinary experience.Thara Thai (forever known to me as Most Decent Thai), is the best you're going to hope for in all of scenic Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. \u00a0If you have scaled your expectations appropriately, you will appreciate it for the deliciosity that it is. \u00a0We had panang curry, mock duck, and green curry, and all were tasty. \u00a0They do make it terrifyingly spicy if you ask, so an ample warning served to keep my meal on the \"hot\" side rather than \"San Diego Wildfire\" (too soon?).The decor is a strange amalgamation between Thai restaurant and pancake house, which I am convinced it once was. \u00a0Something vaguely Alpine/German lurks beneath the varnished wooden seats and gaudy Thai calendar images, I'm just saying.Well worth it for a food stop if you're in C-U, or if you end up becoming a graduate student at UIUC, which I am heavily, heavily considering doing....", 
      "My biggest beef: HIGH PRICES. The price point is extremely way off. Tom Kha = $13.99Yellow Curry = $10.99I've never had to pay more than $5.95 for Tom Kha nor over $7.95 for yellow curry....and I live in Chicago. I'm not sure who they think they are trying to \u00a0cater to....the king and queen of Thailand? I know they have a picture of them hanging up in the restaurant, but they are not fooling me. \u00a0 As far as taste, the food was average. Not terrible by any means, but there is definitely better, especially for what you're paying for. I'm half Thai, so I have the authority to assess this. Not a fan.", 
      "If you're in Champaign (for some really odd reason), you are in for a treat!I took my Thai stepmom here when her and my dad were visiting me; if she gives a Thai restaurant the \"thumbs-up,\" you know it's good! This place is good. It's so good that I drive about 20 minutes just to eat here (which doesn't sound like a lot until you realize it takes only 5 minutes to get anywhere in this town)! I've been able to taste many items on the menu, and I have to say, my favorite is the Thai Green Curry! If you're a curry fan, you will love it. But, even if you're not, you will still probably love it... or at least something on the menu. Ask the waiter what they suggest - they will be able to give you a really good reference based on your other preferences! Now, that is service.Although I prefer take-out here, eating in is a good option. The d\u00e9cor is comfortable, and you can show up in any state (I typically go after the gym, he he). Taking a moment to talk about price, price is the one downfall of this joint. The food is rather expensive, and the portions are small. If I (little ole' me) can eat a whole Curry without feeling overly stuffed, the portions are small. Granted, I'm not a huge rice eater, but I know my Curry and I know small Curry. So, be prepared to take a little bit of a pocket pinch. Is the food worth the price? To me, obviously, because I keep going back, but to someone less desperate for some really good Thai food, maybe not.Myyy Myyy Myyy Thara Thai, oh how I miss you (be back soon).", 
      "Solid mom and pop spot that makes their dishes SPICY! \u00a0I had the red curry hot (as opposed to mild or medium) and it was perfect. \u00a0Seems to attract quite the software developer crowd--what's up geeks?Now all Champaign needs is an Indian place!", 
      "2.5 stars rounded up to 3.I really hate to change my opinion of this place so drastically. Here's why.. This was my first Thai food experience, ever. I had nothing else to compare it to. After living in San Diego for the last 2 1/2 years and having Thai food at at least 2 dozen different places (including Thai iced tea) coming back here for a \"friends reunion\" of sorts was shocking. Shocking because the quality and taste of the food is not that great. Thai iced tea was awful and the food was subpar. The decor and ambiance are awesome, service is great. No complaints there. Unfortunately because of the food I will likely not return.", 
      "Pretty good Thai restaurant in the middle of nowhere... It's literally by an highway exit, so my expectations were pretty low when I went there for dinner. They became even lower when I entered the place and saw that there were only two customers... on a Saturday night! But guess what: the food was actually pretty good. It bothers me a little bit that they have Chinese items listed on the menu when the owners are obviously Thai, but at the Thai food was good. I started with the fish cakes with sweet chili sauce: they were quite good and almost to the ones I used to have in the Bay Area. I then ordered the red curry with chicken, and it was also quite tasty. The service was also very friendly. Probably not the best Thai food I've had, but it was very decent. I do think, though, that it's a little overpriced: I think the entrees could be $1 or $2 cheaper. Still... I'll probably be back.", 
      "I got red curry with tofu from two different places in one week! \u00a0This makes my stomach very happy, of course, but the extra bonus was that I got to compare one of my favorite Thai dishes at two local restaurants.Thara Thai's red curry beats the bamboo shoots out of Basil Thai's red curry.That's not just a cute saying, either, friends. \u00a0I don't know what they did to make normally-bland bamboo shoots taste so good. \u00a0But whatever they did, just thinking about them makes serotonin leak out of my ears. \u00a0The decor reminded me of a mix between a George Webb's and every other Thai restaurant in the world. \u00a0The service was *awesome.* \u00a0Our waitress had a winning smile and was taking care of the busy restaurant all by herself. \u00a0The food came out promptly, water was refilled often, and we were happy.P.S. The Crab Rangoon also did not disappoint.", 
      "This is probably one of the most delicious and authentic Thai restaurants I have been too!I went here 2x with my roommate! \u00a0I introduced her to Thai curry and she loved it and wanted to come back here for lunch on our last day in Champaign!Our first time, we came here for dinner and ordered the pad thai, massamum curry, and the Satay Chicken appetizer! \u00a0So yummy!For lunch we both ordered the red curry and I opted for the mild heat....which still caused me the sniffles! LoL.Oh and I absolutely love their milk green tea beverage! \u00a0They brew their own green tea, add some sweetner, and whole milk in a cup of ice! Absolutely YUMMY! Not like that chalky Starbucks Iced Green Tea shhhcrap! \u00a0Overall, I loved the food here and this was my favorite iEats spot in Champaign for sure!!!", 
      "Great place with consistently great food and the staff clearly take pride in their work.This is what a 5 star review looks like everyone else! \u00a0Wish they would deliver though.", 
      "4 star food. Love the food. You know it's good when it's full at 3pm on a weekday, and when lots of pan-Asian people eat there! For a typical Thai menu it has some good chef specialties like Pineapple Pad Thai, and it isn't overly cheap (most dishes are between $8-13), but the food is excellent. Ambience slightly weird, but it is clean and the service is quick.", 
      "I love this place even though it can be a little pricey. \u00a0Super nice people, great service, and wonderful food! \u00a0I generally get Tom Kha Gai there but I've never been disappointed with any of my dishes.Do keep in mind that they are serious about their spice levels. :)", 
      "We really like their cashew chicken (Thai spicy - which can't actually be THAI spicy because I can eat it) and the pad see ew.", 
      "I have been to Thara Thai consistently since discovering it in January 2013. \u00a0Their Chicken Pad Thai is OUTSTANDING in every way. \u00a0It is a VERY generous portion as well, the dinner plate is enough for 2 meals! \u00a0I love it hot, i am not sure if i am ready for thai hot just yet, soon though.I've had this dish all over town, and to me, this one is THE best.", 
      "This is a place that can be easily overlooked since it is at the edge of town. \u00a0It's a mom and pop shop so don't expect any fancy decor. \u00a0The service was pretty good with the exception of when we first walked in and were ignored for 10 whole minutes. \u00a0But besides that.. the service was good.The food was terrific that I am dissapointed I didn't know about this place a little earlier! \u00a0I thought I knew all the best places in town. \u00a0I tried the Pad Kee Mao which was terrific and the chicken satay.. which was also fantastic. \u00a0I tried their catfish dish which was okay.. but really not very good. \u00a0I thought from the pic that the catfish filets would be deep fried not stir fried. \u00a0The Thai Iced Tea was also good.And yes.. they have chocolate fortune cookies. \u00a0Oh.. and they have Pho.And another good sign is that lots of Thai people frequent this spot. \u00a0Always a good sign of authenticity.", 
      "One of my absolute favorite places to eat in CU. I've been eating there pretty much as long as it's been open and there are very few Thai places that can compare. The staff is always incredibly friendly. The owner and all her family are really friendly and always make you feel welcome. You might want to show up a little early for lunch as it can get very busy at that time.One thing you'll notice right away as you're eating are the quality ingredients which to me justifies the price of the dishes here. My favorite dish there is the Thom Kha Gai. At this point it is like comfort food for me. Whenever I'm having a down day or if I feel like I'm coming down with a cold I'll go in and order it. It has a lot of different levels of flavor that you just don't get anywhere else in town. There's just a lot more ingredients in the dish then most places and they blend perfectly. I never, ever leave anything other than an empty bowl. \u00a0I usually get it about mild to medium spicy. The thing to remember when ordering here is that their spiciness levels can vary and almost always swing towards HOTTER than you might expect. So always get mild if you have any fear of getting too hot of a dish.I have yet to be disappointed by their curry, but my favorite is probably the Massaman curry. I'd also recommend their spring rolls and their pot stickers for an appetizer. Although I've never tried it, one of my friend's can't stop getting their Duck so that might be worth a try as well. I might steer clear of the Pad Thai here. Strangely it's the only thing I've never been 100% happy with, but frankly you can get a decent Pad Thai just about anywhere so it's more fun to branch out and try something new.", 
      "So far every dish I've ever had here has been great but the real reason for the 5 stars is the papaya salad. \u00a0I'm always on the lookout for a yummy papaya salad and it's definitely been a challenge being so far away from home. \u00a0But the one at Thara Thai is everything I could want...fresh, tasty, crunchy, spicy.I've also tried the green, red, and panang curries. \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0The pad thai and pad see ew noodles are also delish. \u00a0I've also tried their version of \"pho\" and it was decent but I'd rather just stick to the traditional Thai dishes at Thara Thai and get pho somewhere else (like at the new Saigon restaurant).I can't remember how fast the service is because I usually order takeout but I do know that the people that work their are extremely nice and friendly. \u00a0The food can get pretty spicy...even a \"medium\" is sweat-inducing...so order with caution. \u00a0My only complaint is that the prices are a little higher than what I'm used to back home. \u00a0But you can get a great deal at lunch time. \u00a0I'd still go there anyways because I think they're the best Thai food in town!", 
      "This place is just ok. I have tried better Thai food in other cities.", 
      "Hands down my favorite Thai place in CU. This little nook of a restaurant is surprisingly authentic - I believe it's run by a Thai family. The location is a bit sketch (in a motel parking lot), but the food is amazing and worth the trip out to bufu. The menu is traditional Thai dishes (none of that fusion nonsense), and if you ask for spicy they will deliver...It's a little bit pricier than the takeout/eat in Thai places around town and a bit farther from campus, but imho it's worth the trip out if you're serious about your thai food.My faves from the menu are the pineapple fried rice, the duck dish and the mango/sticky rice for dessert.", 
      "It's usually a battle between the two of us as to which Thai place we get to go to on our trips back to Champaign: Golden Wok or Thara Thai.This place has the best pad see ew I've had. \u00a0Period. \u00a0This even includes the cao he fun in Chinese places. \u00a0Also, their spicyness scale is a bit skewed to the crazy spicy side, where even Medium borders the too spicy side for me.Service is relatively slow, so if you're meeting up with some people here, expect to spend a decent amount of time there. \u00a0Even though this place is a bit more expensive than the other places in the area but it's worth stopping by.", 
      "I'm mad at my husband.*So I've lived in Champaign for around 4 years now, and I hadn't been to Thara Thai until recently. Every time my husband took me out for Thai, it was to My Thai or Nitaya Thai. Every time I would say, \"Hey, I've never been to Thara Thai, let's try it because I don't actually like My Thai that much\" he would be like \"Let's not because every time I go there with 40 other people for lunch it takes a long time. Let's just go to My Thai.\"So I finally went to Thara Thai with a group of friends. I can't believe I've been missing out on Thara Thai for so long! GRR HUSBAND*.The pros: FOOD. The food is AMAZING. I'm a fiend for eggplant dishes, but haven't found one that has knocked me out of the park at any of the other local Thai restaurants. The eggplant basil stir fry dish is phenomenal. I ordered a mild spice level, even though I like spice, just because I was afraid of going too hot. Next time, I'll definitely get medium, since I ended up dousing my dish with sriracha. The dish clearly took time and effort to make, and the result was phenomenal. The prices are on the higher side, but not unreasonable for a date night or special outing. I had a Thai iced tea, and it was very, very good. The service was great - very prompt, water glasses were filled, super friendly.The cons: The wait time can be long. Again, I recommend it for a date, or for a dinner where you might have some extra time to spare. I don't think it would be good for a business or mid-day lunch break, as you might not get done within an hour if you go with a group. Again, price is a little steep, but considering that the food is housemade and not just scooped from a vat of prepared food, these things are worth it. *Disclaimer - not really mad. May be taking some liberties here.", 
      "We are at U of I for Halloween and looking for a quick bite of Thai. We found Thara via Google maps and decided to give it a try. \u00a0The staff was friendly and accomodating - we arrived in full costume garb and acted the parts (magician and bunny and three blind mice). The place was crowded and service was slow, so probably not a place to go if you are in a hurry, though they could have been under-staffed. However, the food was excellent. The Tom Kha soup was among the best I have ever had, the pad sie ewe thai was delicious (according to friends) and the spring rolls were fresh.A couple of call outs: they don't serve alchohol, it was a bit pricey, but we are used to Chicago, where there are thai places on every corner. Finally, when they spice things, they really heat them - if you want mild, really stress that.", 
      "The place is ok. I'm not going to do a long review about it since I've eaten at plenty of Thai restaurant and Laos. This place is good for what we have around in Champaign, but by far only somewhat a copy cat of authentic Thai food. The place is over price by a lot, for it being in a small town. I can't give it anymore better than a 3 star. When in all reality their food only get a 2 star."

      "Full disclosure - I'm picky about my Thai food. \u00a0Not just because I've had the real deal in Thailand but because I have a limited palette for spicy food and certain textures often found in Thai cuisine.When the server asked what level of spices (nothing, mild, medium, hot) I went with mild on my sweet and sour chicken. \u00a0I didn't want anything too bland so I figured mild was a pretty safe bet. \u00a0OMG, wrongo! \u00a0Yeah, my lips were burning after only a couple bites. \u00a0I will say, however, that it was mighty tasty and that I did my best to finish a pretty significant chunk of it. \u00a0I also had a few bites of Mike's Pad Thai which he also ordered mild. \u00a0His was very slightly less extreme as mine but still had a pretty powerful kick. \u00a0Overall, I thought the food was great, despite their interpretation of \"mild\" heat. \u00a0I think that by asking for no spice that I would enjoy it even more. \u00a0My only other complaint would be that I had to flag down our server for water. \u00a0There were only a couple tables full of people but I felt the server was MIA too often. And every second counts when your mouth is on fire!", 
      "If I could marry the food at Thara Thai, I would. \u00a0So many restaurants before it had trouble staying open in the same location, so what a relief that the service and food have convinced people to keep coming!The prices have gotten a bit higher since they first opened some time around 2003 or 2004, but it is worth it. There are no bad curries on the menu (Panang being my favorite), the noodle dishes are fabulous as are the pho options! And the papaya salad is such a tasty treat to be enjoyed on a hot summer day.I have lived in two metropolitan areas in my lifetime (Minneapolis and Chicago), and I maintain that Thara Thai beats out any Thai I've had in either area.",

      "I love thai food, probably my biggest crave is some good spicy noodles, a curry, larb gai, well pretty much everything at a good thai joint. \u00a0I've eaten at every thai place in champaign urbana many times but none more than thara. \u00a0It's not for ambiance, it's not for a wine list (sorry no alcohol) its simply the best thai food in town. \u00a0Family run, mom's in the kitchen just plain great. \u00a0If you like it spicy, or you don't, be warned they don't hold back, thai spicy is real thai spicy so choose your level accordingly. \u00a0personally i like a good sweat and medium plus will get you there. \u00a0full thai hot and watch out! \u00a0enjoy!!", 
      "Definitely for sure the best Thai restaurant in CU, though notice that it still only gets 3 stars for being worse than the worst Thai restaurant I ever went to in Boston. \u00a0The staff is friendlier than at Siam Terrace by like 100x, and in critical addition to that the food is better and also cheaper. \u00a0It doesn't have \"ambience\" like Siam Terrace does; it's just a family style Thai Cafe with a Pepsi machine in the back and big green Apartment Finder bins out front. \u00a0Eating there I feel like I've become the long departed favorite cousin of a big Thai family for an evening, especially when I dig in to my mega heavy all coconut milk nice spicy red curry.\rDon't even compare this place to Nitaya. \u00a0Nitaya is a non-entity in the discussion about what is the best Thai place.", 
      "Oh, delicious, delicious Thara Thai! I've tried many places in the C-U and none compare to Thara Thai. \u00a0I don't know where they get those tiny little eggplants but they are tasty! Their curry is the bomb. Also, consider yourself warned about their spice levels... this is a THAI restaurant. That shit's spicy, son. I love spicy food and I order the medium... and its HOT. If you have a sensitive stomach you should also probably expect spicy poops.", 
      "We had asked one of our hotel staff members for his favorite local asian place, and this is the one he recommended. We certainly were not disappointed. The atmosphere of this tiny place is definitely nothing to write home about, but that didn't keep the dining room from filling up to capacity by 7:30pm anyway. We had the chicken satay and potstickers as appetizers. Both were delicious. I had the pad lard nar, and it was incredible. The portions were just the right size, too, where I didn't feel any regret from having eaten too much. If ever in town again, I would definitely return.", 
      "This is a tiny place next to an economy hotel. It's decor is cluttered. It doesn't feel clean but that could be because most of the tables sat full of dirty dishes. I ordered iced tea and basil chicken. The tea had that nasty old tea flavor. I specifically asked the waitress if it was freshly brewed. We waited way too long for our food after we ordered. \u00a045 minutes. We had just discussed leaving when the food arrived. \u00a0I've eaten basil chicken at various Thai places across the country. Never have I paid so much for so little. It was a small amount and when I tasted it, it tasted like any generic Chinese dish - not all all like I expected. The veggies were overcooked and soggy. And by veggies, i mean sliced onion. That's all there was. Onion and chicken. There were about 2 basil leaves, which imparted no basil flavor.I can't understand why this place has such good reviews. It was filthy and the food was bad and expensive.", 
      "The food is great and among the top in the Champaign area. I like my food extra hot, and this place can make it the spiciest. I love Thai iced tea, but I their milk green tea the best. The staff are always really friendly. It's a quaint place but also small. I can't really fault them for it but the limited seating can make it difficult to get a seat during busy times.", 
      "I am a big fan of Thai food, so i may have too high expectation for it.I feel the one is a little bit overrated, the food is ok, but not enough options, and \u00a0the place is not really nice.", 
      "Amazing thai place, that serves more than simply thai cuisine. My favorite dish there (to be fair, I have never tried anything other than this same dish) is the General Tso's Chicken, which isn't a traditional thai dish. I always order my food \"Thai Spicy\" which clears up your sinuses, but it's exactly the way I want it. They are the only Asian restaurant I've found that will actually listen when I tell them to hurt me, spicy food wise. The place is run by a family. The server during the lunch is usually the son, who is extremely nice (he left the restaurant to help a guy in a wheel chair struggling in freshly fallen snow!) and the mom is usually back in the kitchen pumping out the food orders. They're quite a team! I've moved away for school, but am back in CU a lot and always make it a point to hit this place up when I'm around. During the dinner hours, as with many Asian restaurants the food isn't the cheapest (still, very fair for what you're getting) but the lunch specials are fantastic. My favorite lunch dish runs about $7.95, which is a couple bucks off the normal price. Little hole in the wall place that you'd never guess would be as amazing as it is.", 
      "I love Thara Thai. My favorite dish is the Pineapple Pad Thai but their Pho comes in at a close second. I also love the Pineapple fried rice, the spring rolls (best peanut sauce in town), and the Curry. I usually call ahead and order carry-out since seating is limited but I love when we do go and sit down because I can always expect to have an enjoyable visit. I get Medium hot on many of the dishes as the spicy levels are definitely up there. Their prices are a bit higher than some of the other places in town but the quality of the food is so much better that I find it is totally worth the extra. I cannot express how fabulous the Pho is, I get it whenever I feel under the weather and many times during the winter just to warm my belly.", 
      "The service was very slow from the time we got there until we left. We waited over a half hour for a table, it took the server at least 10 minutes to bring us water followed by another 10 until we ordered. Our food took an unusually long time to come out as well. The table next to us wasn't bussed for over 30 minutes, which was kind of unsightly. I was hoping it was worth the wait, but the food wasn't super amazing or anything. We ordered crab rangoon and fried pot stickers for an appetizer. The crab rangoon had celery or cucumber in it which made for a very weird tasting crab rangoon. The sauce that came with the pot stickers was too fishy for my liking. However, it paired well with the sauce that came with the crab rangoon. We ordered chicken pad thai for our entree. We ordered it medium I believe and it was a good heat level. It was tasty, but kind of heavy. In fact, our whole dinner was pretty heavy. I can order crab rangoon and chicken pad thai at other places and not walk away with that feeling.In my opinion the food was worth exactly 3 stars. Kind of tasty, but not anything amazing.", 
      "Horrific decor, terrible location, great food. Prices are a little bit higher than you would expect for fast-food Asian food, but this place's quality is higher than your standard fast-food Asian joint (though it looks no better).The Mock Duck dish is one of their best. FYI, mock duck is seasoned seitan, aka wheat gluten and is similiar to tofu in that it is a plant-based protein that is pretty flavor-neutral until it is made a part of a dish, but is different in that its texture more closely resembles meat and it seems to have more protein and fiber.I think that like many places, the takeout portions are larger.", 
      "One of my favorite thai food places in all of Illinois! Beef pho special, pad sayew and pad thai never disappoint.", 
      "Yummy food, and really helpful staff. We had the chefs' son as our waiter, and he was really helpful *and knew what vegan was!* When I asked for a recommendation for vegetarian food, he recommended his favorite, but then immediately pointed out that it had egg in the batter (the mock duck) so it wasn't vegan. This is the first restaurant in Champaign where that has happened :)Everything is freshly made in the kitchen, and they seem very adaptable. We had a really good experience :)", 
      "Outstanding food with friendly, reasonably fast, service. \u00a0Don't ask for hot unless you mean it. \u00a0I love hot food and this is one of the few places that can make me sweat!The pad thai is the best I have had and the soups are always good but I think my favorite is the Tilapia in a chili lime sauce.Don't miss the crab rangoon!", 
      "I'm a true lover of Thai food and coming from Chicago and having spent some time in San Fran have eaten at some truly amazing Thai restaurants. Not to insult the C-U area or anything but the restaurants are overall lacking in quality in this neck of the woods. Thara Thai has all the typical Thai dishes you would expect. This place is pretty traditional so don't expect the yuppy-ized all white chicken meat in the \u00a0dishes, either. The curries, pad thai, and pad see ew are all pretty average. There's nothing amazing about this place but it is probably the best Thai food available in the area.I do have to say, don't bother with the veggie spring rolls or veggie potstickers, I'm pretty sure those are frozen. \u00a0DO however check out the sticky rice with custard dessert. Pretty yummy.", 
      "This is my favorite Thai place in CU. mom and pop in the back, Chris, the son, out front with his sister. Everything is delicious! I get the see eiw pad Thai, Thai hot and I leave with a pleasant burn, which is hard to get in CU! We even ordered their food for our wedding celebration and everyone was ecstatic. They gave us a ton of chocolate fortune cookies, chopsticks and a whole bottle of sriracha too! The Tom yum and Tom kah gai are amazing too. Basically, you need to eat here again and again and you will still never have enough.", 
      "This place is really small on the inside and it is difficult to find an open table if you want to eat in often, but the food is pretty good. \u00a0Service, prices, and menu selection is all pretty good, and the food is well priced and portioned. \u00a0Maybe prices are a little bit on the higher side. They have a knack for making everything really hot and spicy as well so if you want it mild or not spicy, MAKE sure you do. \u00a0Even the mild is pretty spicy. \u00a0I'm not crazy about this place, but I would definitely go again.", 
      "I usually go here because I have Asian foodie friends, and they say this is their favorite Thai restaurant in town. \u00a0I have yet to branch out from pineapple or chicken pad thai, but they are really good. \u00a0As other reviewers say, though, BE CAREFUL how much spice you order. \u00a0The \"mild\" has definite kick to it, and is plenty of spice for me. \u00a0My friends order \"medium\" and are big spicy food eaters---so anything more than that might not be a good idea!It is true, too, that it's kind of pricey. \u00a0I consider it a splurge that is definitely worth it if you are a true Thai food lover.", 
      "Best Thai food around, prices maybe one or two bucks over average for the area but it is worth it. Family business great people.", 
      "I was visiting Champaign and heard from a lot of current students that this place was a good find. \u00a0It was delicious! \u00a0I am writing this from my hotel room and I'm full and happy after the meal.We had the Shumai to start--very good, \u00a0but just a warning that the sauce is a bit spicy if you don't tolerate spicy well. \u00a0We got the mongolian beef, pad see ew, and the pad kee mao. \u00a0Everything was REALLY good. \u00a0The service was great--the entrees came out little slower that my stomach would have liked but the appetizer came out quickly enough for the wait to be tolerable. \u00a0We also added one of the noodle dishes after we got our entrees because the portions were smaller than we anticipated. \u00a0The 2nd noodle dish came out pretty quickly though, so it was nice to see how responsive and quick the kitchen was.Overall--very good and there wasn't a wait at 8pm on a Saturday. \u00a0If I come to school here, I will definitely (and eagerly!) come back to eat here.", 
      "Good", 
      "Since I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in May, this place has been about the most accommodating restaurant for me. They know me very well and are always very pleasant. They understand gluten intolerance and even will make things with my own gluten-free soy sauce. Like I said, the only concern I have is that they tend to make things a bit too spicy. But they have been so good to me otherwise and are so much better than the other Thai restaurants in town.", 
      "My favorite Thai restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area! It's also one of the best Thai food restaurants that I've been to. My favorite dishes are the pho special and papaya salad. Excellent service as well! Even thought it's far from campus, it's always full of customers.", 
      "I would have to say this place is hands down some of the best Thai food. It is family owned which is great and nice to support. The seating area isn't very large so it can get crowded. A large group of us from work go there and all enjoy it. I generally call ahead and they can accommodate is with no problem. I've only ordered the vegetarian pad dishes and the curries. My favorite is the green curry. The service is very friendly and the food is great, I highly recommend this place!", 
      "Absolutely amazing thai food. I have to order it \"super extra mild\" and it comes what I would compare to other thai places as medium. They give you a choice of no spice, mild, medium, and spicy. But you can say extra mild so your mouth isn't in pain later. Be prepared to wait a while for your food, maybe 35-45 minutes. The first time we went, we were a little mad the table of 10 that ordered 15 minutes after us got all their dishes and were nearly finished by the time just me and my husband were served. We like that it is a family business and that they have a lot of vegetarian options for when we're not feeling like having meat. Tofu is cooked perfectly every time. The atmosphere isn't fancy, but the food is excellent.", 
      "I ended up here for the first time tonight because both Golden wok and Nithaya were closed on a Sunday night. But I was delighted to discover another good Thai food in town. I had the special pad thai with basil, and it was pretty good. I'll go there more often.Edit: I like this place a lot. Nowadays I think it is the best Thai place in town.", 
      "The food is a little pricey for this area in my mind and for being situated in the parking lot of a motel. The food however I must admit is pretty good. This Thai restaurant has probably the best Thai noodle dishes in the area and whoever the chef is, really knows their way with a wok.", 
      "Zero ambiance. Delicious food and friendly service. Plenty of parking. Great prices. Zero ambiance. I don't care about ambiance, and if you don't either, this is your spot, champ.", 
      "Delicious and affordable. \u00a0They have a lunch menu and I ordered the Ginger Chicken - mild. \u00a0And it was very good. \u00a0I had enough for 2 whole meals. \u00a0My friends ordered the Pad See Eiw - w/ Chicken & Mild, I think I liked that even better. \u00a0The flavor was soy but also sweet. \u00a0Mmmm. \u00a0And then...we got Chocolate Fortune Cookies...surprisingly pleasant, who knew?", 
      "This is hands down the best Thai restaurant anywhere in the area - have not had better even in Chicago! \u00a0My family and I have been eating here at \"nice lady Thai\" since they first opened up ~ a decade ago, and even though we now live several hours away we still go out of our way to eat there. This is a family restaurant - meaning the entire family is part of the business, and they are all great folks. FRESH - HOMEMADE - DELICIOUS - FRIENDLYEverything on the menu is good. They cook to order, so if you like it a certain way all you have to do is say so... and if you don't see it on the menu, you can bet that they can still make it as good as you have had it anywhere else. It is probably worth mentioning that they have expanded their menu a few times and because I love just ab out everything they make it gets harder and harder to decide what to order when I want to try the new stuff too...To Joe E, I have to tell you that Pad Thai(PT) is not the same dish as Pad See Ewe (PSE) at all - the only similarity being that they have rice noodles in them (yet still the type of rice noodle is even different). If you are a PT fan, the next time you go there you should ask them to make you PT with the wide noodles. Their \u00a0PT is the best around, but it doesn't taste anything like the PSE as the former has peanut as a dominant flavor, while the latter is sweet soy flavor. Thara's PSE thai hot is actually one of my favorite standby dishes, with fresh wide rice noodles and chinese broccoli - YUM! I have yet to be able to make it better at home, although I have come close. \u00a0 A couple of my favorites here (and there are so many) are the shrimp/seafood soups (Tom Yum or Tom Kha) and the Panang Curry - all of which has the wonderful aroma and flavor of the Kaffir lime in them. \u00a0We almost always order the crab Rangoon - which is not even in the same realm as the typical Chinese place stuff - this is fresh and delicious. My buddy loves their shumai, although that might be kind of an acquired taste as my wife is not fond of it.. \u00a0 A few folks commented on their high prices, but there simply is no substitute for good Thai food. The location is what it is, but they have never sacrificed the quality to stay in business. The fact is that even after they raised their prices you are lucky to get a table here in the evening or on weekends - they are almost always packed. \u00a0This is a prime example of supply and demand economics at work. This is a real gem of a restaurant, and I love to support this great family. As long as they stay in business and keep making the food the way they do, they can expect to see us as often as we can make it there!", 
      "i recently went on thai food kick around town... and to make the comparison fair decided to have basil chicken in several places... Thara Thai, Nitaya Thai and Basil Thai in campustown. the first one (Thara Thai) is probably the best. plenty of food, good taste, quite spicy -- be warned, their \"medium\" spicy would be considered hot in most other places. the chicken was good, but a bit dry, and the rice portion was small, hence minus one star. but those things may not bother everyone. in any case, probably the best place for Thai take-out in the Chambana area. as for dine-in, i don't know -- but the location itself (sharing a parking lot with some cheap motel) is somewhat less than romantic. i'd keep any first-dates away...update -- 1 year later -- recently, i noticed their rice portions have become \"normal sized\".", 
      "I went to this place on Sunday evening at 620pm. I ordered broccoli and tofu. Thats it. Stir fry brocoli and tofu. The waitress told me 15 minutes. I wanted until 7pm. Total of 40 minutes. That is unacceptable. It was not the waitresses fault (I don't think). She was the only waitress (or waiter) for a house full of approximately 30 patrons and 2 to go orders. I will not be going back because of this poor service.", 
      "Thara Thai is a clean,comfortable, friendly place that serves wonderful Thai food. \u00a0There's a lovely young woman there who always waits on us and makes us feel at home. \u00a0Favorites on the menu include the papaya salad, the cucumber salad, and the mussamon curry which is a stew made of chicken or tofu with potatoes and peanuts. \u00a0I thought their pad thai was a little greasy, so I don't order that. \u00a0They are quick with drink refills and service is very attentive. \u00a0Prices are in the middle range-better come with twenty dollars to get a good entree, drink and possibly an appetizer.", 
      "Probably the best Thai food in CU, taking a star off as it's a tad bit expensive and the waiting time for orders is a little too much.", 
      "Don't let the looks of the building fool you. The food is fantastic. I have had amazing thia before and this ranks right up there with the places I have been in Atlanta and NYC. Calamari was amazing as was the pad Thai.", 
      "i normally went to saigon for pho in this area but i tried this new place for once.. i really needed a good hangover soup and this definitely hit the spot.server is SO friendly and nice.this place got packed as soon as it opened up on a sunday.. this shows how good the place is!good water refills. thank you.wait was reasonable. only thing to be careful about is the spiciness.. medium is probably measurable to hot cheetos. yum!but this place is great for pho. it was different that what i was used to but i liked it. a lot. i'd definitely come here again.", 
      "By far one of the best Thai places in CU, though as the other reviewers point out, it is at horrendous location. It doesn't have the ambiance of some of the other CU Thai places, but I this place has the best flavor. The food is always wonderfully rich and spicy, especially the basil chicken with chile sauce. The service is also great and they will customize your dish if you ask nicely."

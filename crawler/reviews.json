The food isn't anything that is uniquely different, but it's really well done. The service here was something that I really appreciated - our waiter was extremely tentative and polite, and was able to do some special changes to our dishes.Really pleased with the ambiance, food and service. Would absolutely go back (with a reservation!)",

It's beautiful inside too-- feels like I'm dining in a rustic fairy cave. They were so busy they ran out of half the menu, but, O, \u00a0the food that they did have... I love that the menu is so fresh and that they have so many unique dishes to go with fall. Big Grove isn't *the* tastiest restaurant I've ever been too, but my GOD, it is definitely up there and it definitely trumps any nearby restaurant.",

The atmosphere is upscale overall and the food presentation is excellent. \u00a0The menu options are limited. \u00a0The music is questionably appropriate for dinner but not offensive.",

However, the bartender was at least friendly and the popcorn was fairly good, if not a little stale. I ordered a Tavern Burger which cost $12. The burger was alright; I always feel a bit jipped when a restaurant burger doesn't include tomatoes in it. It didn't help that they couldn't make two alcoholic beverages that my friend and I asked for. All in all, the hike up in the prices is paying for the atmosphere for the establishment.",

        "review": "It's been over a year since my first review. Given its popularity, I decided to give this place another chance. Since that initial visit, I have now tried their chicken and dumplings and the skirt steak. The chicken was lovely, moist and well seasoned, the dumplings, however, were a bit of a downer--they were SALTY, small, and sparse, nothing exciting. I might try the dish again, but will have to ask them to be mindful of their salt. The skirt steak was cooked as requested (medium) and was surprisingly tender. I think that they change the accompanying veggies seasonally, but it's always served with a chimichurri (sauce). Given that chimi is one of my favorite sauces, I'll admit that I was skeptical of trying it in Champaign, and was pleasantly surprised--the downfall, they serve it as decorative dots on the plate, rather than a sauce for the meat so there's hardly any of it to enjoy! As you can see, my review of the food has much improved since my first post. I still think that it is overpriced for the portions and location (come on it's Champaign!). My last waitress was pretty good--so service also seems to have improved (or I might've just been lucky).",

Good atmosphere, good service, good beer.Full review:Based on my two trips to the Big Grove, it seems to be hit or miss.The first time I went, around January of 2014, I was extremely impressed. I had pork belly as an appetizer (amazing) with a Dogfish Head 90 minute to chase it down (the beer selection is pretty great). For dinner, I had a perfectly cooked steak (don't remember the cut), served alongside gnocchi. Everything I ate was relatively simple, but they executed perfectly on the local, farm to table ingredients (they're proud of that here). Service was fantastic.The second time I went, in July 2014, the food was very disappointing. The steak was solid again, but it was served alongside one of the most bitter, poorly cooked broccolini I've ever had the displeasure of tasting. The pork tendorloin was chewy, definitely do not recommend. And this time, the pork belly appetizer was served differently, as a salad. I think it's pretty difficult to screw up pork belly, but they managed to do so. It tasted as if it were cooked a day ago, and it was difficult to find much pork belly beneath the greens. Service was tremendous on both occasions. Our water and popcorn (the popcorn is great) were refilled consistently, and the waiter seemed to take pride in the food.",

I had the falafel, which was a tad dry, but it's falafel, and this is easy to screw up - forgivable. \u00a0The other dishes were great. \u00a0Excellent turkey sandwich, though the sourdough is a bit airy for my tastes. \u00a0A traditional sourdough needs some ... sourness and doughiness - this really does taste like airy French or Italian bread. The saged popcorn is a nice touch, but I have been here about seven times, and it is always saged popcorn, and the server consistently says \"Our popcorn -today- is fried sage\". ... which to me implies that this will change once in a while. \u00a0In my experience, it does not. Finally, and this has been said *dozens* of times here. \u00a0The prices are completely out of line with Champaign. \u00a0I can get locally sourced ingredients to create a Turkey sandwich and mixed green salad at the local grocery, and a 10oz bottle of the same beer. \u00a0Grand total will be well under $20 with a full six pack and ingredients to spare. My damage for lunch? \u00a0$23 after a modest tip. \u00a0The following day I had a (good) soup of Yellow Beet root and mixed green salad. \u00a0To be clear, we are talking about a CUP of soup and a small plate of salad, for $18. Completely out of touch with the local area and absolutely haranguing customers on the guise of farm-to-table. \u00a0Want to like it based on the food, can't stand to be here based on the price. \u00a0If you're willing to literally incinerate your money, hop on in.",

        "review": "I was glad to see something young and fresh in place of Jim Gould. Gould was boring and dated, but the only option we had in the C-U if you wanted to go to a \"nice\" restaurant. Big Grove Tavern has a casual updated atmosphere with an original concept for the C-U (farm to table). We wanted to go to Destihl (right across from Big Grove) yesterday for lunch, \u00a0but there was a wait and we couldn't wait. We finally had a chance to try Big Grove. There was no wait, and we were seated right away. We were with our 2.5 year old, and \u00a0we have never gone to a kid restaurant. Our daughter is used to dining in grown up restaurants with grown ups, but even the most patient of young foodies could use a quiet distraction while they wait. \u00a0Destihl is not a kids' restaurant, but they have a variety of foods to choose from on the kids' menu and they give the kids crayons to color on the kids' menu. Smart and simple concept that works well. The server at Big Grove said they do not have a kids' menu, but they have \"kid friendly\" options. All they had was grilled cheese and sweet potato fries. I asked if we could just get regular potato fries and the server said \"yes\" so that is what my daughter got. I never understood the whole trend of replacing delicious french fries with sweet potato fries--they don't taste better nor are they \"healthier\" or much lower in calories. If you are going to eat fries make them from potatoes not sweet potatoes. I wanted to order a burger, but all their burger options are a blend of beef, bison and pork and I don't want to eat bison so I ordered the Black Bean Burger. \u00a0My husband ordered \"The Baltimore\"which is basically a BLT with avocados. My daughter's fries had more salt than there is in salt. Maybe it was just that day, but someone went really heavy handed with the salt. My Black Bean Burger was really good. It's not what I wanted to eat, but if you are vegetarian (I have been on and off for years) this was delicious. My husband's order was okay. It's a BLT with avocado. Why take a classic and add something that adds nothing? The server was great--very nice person and efficient. The design and layout of the restaurant is great. Casual and open. Trying to be a gastropub, but misses the mark with the menu. It's still a big step up for the C-U in terms of dining options. I liked this place. I like the concept, the layout, the service, but the menu is not for me. The food is not bad, but not great. Too many options like a classic burger or BLT are turned into things that are trying too hard to be \"cheffie\", but miss the mark. I just wish they didn't try to reinvent the wheel on these American food classics. If they're going to reinvent the classics they better make them better than the original. I would have liked to see a few classics taken up a notch with a gourmet twist or just a few classics done really well. Overall Big Grove is worth a try, but I wouldn't highly recommend it or anything because the food options are limited and the food tastes okay. Not great, just okay.",

Potatoes were surprisingly tasty, and the eggs were eggs.

These things were addicting. I shared a little, but not much! Gotta love some good brussel sprouts. I still don't get why kids hate these things so much???Then since I ate vegetables to start like a good kid (I know, yes they were fried, but come on, let me have my cake and it too, okay?), I thought that granted me the ability to get their mac and cheese in a little oven baked dish packed with tons of cheese, bacon, leeks, fried shallots, and then as it should be, topped with crumbled bread crumbs! Mmmmmm that mac and cheese was exactly how I like my mac and cheese! Hot, creamy, cheesy, goodness. Done and done. Plus they had a good beer selection here too, the only thing I think that was missing was more attentive service since I would have ordered more beer if they had come around more quickly and the water service, but pretty minor!

The only downside of having a variable menu based on only the freshest locally available ingredients is that sometimes, the options aren't that great and can feel over priced for the quality. Also, their beer is way overpriced but I guess that's okay.I recommend seeing what dishes they have available before you go. They always have a rotating menu.",

We also started off with the chicken liver pate. Incredibly smooth and paired well with a side of seared pears atop freshly toasted, thick country bread. Did I mention the pickled onions? That sealed the deal.Service here...incredible. From our host to our waiters, each staff member stepped out of their way to be easygoing and amicable. I had several lovely conversation about food with the knowledgeable people who work here.Beautiful interior as well, quite chic with a rustic edge (look at those antler/ branch chandeliers). Wide open space with gorgeous, intimate lighting.The only thing I wish I could change? The price. Alas, great portions with an equally robust price. The special, in particular, did not have a price listed. Be sure to come here for a celebration or special event, it's quite lovely.",

I was pleasantly surprised how great the whole experience was.On Monday night they had a nice pre fixe menu for $50 with shared appetizer, soup/salad, entree, and shared dessert. Otherwise I could see dinner getting pricey here fast. We started with the Brussels sprouts which were lightly fried and not as oily as most fried sprouts. I could eat these all day.We tried a couple of deviled eggs and they fact that you can order them one apiece for $1 is nice if you just want a taste. Pretty standard, but tasty as most deviled eggs (to me) usually are. The cauliflower soup was nice as well. A bit plainer tasting than butternut squash soup, but I would still order it again with some toasted almonds. The steak entree was cooked perfectly though they never asked how I wanted it cooked. Glad they read my mind and got the medium rare cook correct. Root veggies were good too.I wasn't in love with the rice pudding, though it's not usually my thing. I didn't think it actually had rice in it...Though I don't get to Champaign too often, I would easily recommend it for someone looking for a good farm to table restaurant. Especially Mondays!",

Like, some of the stuff that comes out of their mouths actually angers me. So I was not too eager to come to this place thats all \"local, farm to table, blah blah blah.\" Because a lot of times thats a hipster excuse for mediocre tasting food. I dont care if its local or organic or any of that. I just want it to be tasty!! When we walked in I was like... here we go. The OC soundtrack is playing, the menu comes on little clipboards with the farms listed on it, and there is no salt or pepper shakers on any of the tables. It seemed pretentious to me. But for the most part, everything I tried here was tasty.We had the fried cheesy grits, french fries with malt vinegar aioli, and pickled veggies for an appetizer. I didn't try the vegetables because pickled stuff is not for me. The other two passed the test.For dinner, I ordered the macaroni and cheese. In retrospect I wish I would have ordered the vegetarian version because there was so much bacon in this that it actually took away from the goodness of the cheese. But +1 for it being piping hot.The rest of the family had a pork tenderloin, beef short rib, and burger. I tasted the short rib and the burger- the rib was a little salty but still good. The burger was flavorful but for me (and this is just a personal preference) the mixture of meats made it a little too soft.We did have dessert- Gooey butter cake and a chocolate pot-de-creme. The butter cake fell a little short. I was expecting it to be warm and gooey. It was cold, not gooey, but still rich. The pot-de-creme, was... *kisses fingers like an italian chef* Perfectly bittersweet, rich rich rich, and topped with vanilla whipped cream that I could see the little vanilla speckles in. Nom.Our server was really cool and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job. He kept referring to the chef as \"chef,\" like \"chef makes this, and chef did that\" which was kind of irksome, just because its like... you're in Champaign IL, chef.

I was wrong...I was down in the U of I area during homecoming and made a reservation just in case it was packed for an early dinner. When we arrived, the place was empty. We were taken to our table and given this small one page menu. I thought it was the drink menu, but no, it was the dinner menu. A bit suprised, I asked my father if he would rather go to DESTIL across the street, but he wanted to try this new local joint. We decided that I was going to get the \"famous\" burger and my dad was going to get the Mac and Cheese. Our server came over and my dad started by ordering the Mac and Cheese, but he asked if he could get it without the onions (shallots and leeks). He was told NO because they already have it premixed. Premixed? She assured him that there was not alot of onions so we continued. For $12 on the burger and $14 for the Mac and Cheese, we were expecting something spectacular. My burger came out. It was a mix of bison, beef, and pork. I was expecting something very flavorful. It was bland as could be. Also, it was about 1/8 of a pound. One of the smallest burgers I have ever eaten. The fries that came with this was good, but the dish was not worth it. My dad's Mac and Cheese came out in a small bowl and half of it was made up of shallots and leeks. I tasted it and thought that it was good, but he HATED it. We had the manager called over and he took it away and took it off of the bill without us asking. He asked if we wanted something else, but my dad complained that the menu was too small for him to go with anything else. Instead of apologizing, the manager told him \"well its all local\" and he walked away. Our server was nice, but I could overhear the hostess and the manager talking about future reservations for the night with an attitude and snarky responses to each other. People can hear you folks! \u00a0It was as if they were doing us a favor by being open. In short, skip this place and go to other places within a block of this place. They know how to treat their customers and not to overcharge. I would suggest Guido's!",

The menu itself is charming - and the attention to the farm-to-table detail is commendable. There's seasoned popcorn on the table - a nice touch. I tried the very economical \"If It's From The Vine It's Fine\" daily wine special, which was quite a brilliant surprise for the price. I would recommend this to anyone. The take on a wedge salad - using bibb lettuce - was inspired. I was surprised there was no bread served with the salad. And, while I realize this is the chef's preference, I wanted some to sop up a little of the salad's very tasty creamy herb vinaigrette. And so I asked for some bread. And received some lovely bread to accompany the salad. For a main I ordered the Tavern Burger - a monster of beef, bison & pork, red onion marmalade, cornichon aioli - and served with house-cut fries. The fries were great! A bit less greasy version of those fantastic greasy kind of fries you get from a hot dog stand. Super good. As was the burger - the marmalade - and the cornichon aioli. Everything was perfect except...the bun! - Which was so bland and tough and flavorless, I tossed it to the side and knife and forked the burger.I'm sure, if I brought this detail to the staffs attention, they would have somehow taken care of things - they were nice that way. So I can only fault myself for not making an issue of it then. But man - compared to everything else - that was so great - that bun was a letdown. Regardless, I highly recommend Big Grove Tavern.",

We started with the tater tots and deviled eggs for appetizers. I loved the tater tots. They're not your typical frozen tots. They had some kind of apple puree sauce on the plate. Initially, I was skeptical, potato and apple together? It was delicious though. Holy cow. I really enjoyed that. I wish more than 4 came in an order though. The deviled eggs were nice, also. I really got a lot of the sweet pea flavor. It sounds odd but it was great and added a freshness to the egg. For dinner, several of us got the burger. Ohhhh my gosh. It was great. Cooked to the perfect temperature. It was a combo of bison, pork, and beef. The red onion marmalade on top was awesome. It added a sweetness and a lot of great flavor. A couple other people had the fried egg on top and they enjoyed it. The bun wasn't store bought and tasted homemade, very similar to what my husband bakes. It was nice to have a bun that doesn't disintegrate. The hand cut fries that came with the burger were the best fries I have had in years. Another friend INHALED the white fish. I didn't taste it but he said it was great. Someone else got the pork belly and kohlrabi gratin. She said it was great and was really happy with her choice. I wish I hadn't been at the opposite end of the table so I could have stolen a bite. It looked good. For a cocktail I had the Tavern Infusion. It was great and refreshing. There was a good selection of beer and wine, too. I stuck with one cocktail and water though. It was a nice touch when the owner came around to the tables and said hi and checked on us and other tables. She seemed really nice. Everyone at our table enjoyed the meal.

        "review": "We went for an early Saturday night dinner, drawn in by new fine dining in the area (which is limited) and the promise of local farm to table style. We are huge fans of many local farm efforts, which can be sampled at the Common Ground Co-op and the Market at the Square on Saturdays at Lincoln Square Mall -- and now, Big Grove Tavern.First, the food, from a foodie perspective: Fresh product, well selected and well cared for. The flavors of the natural food are highlighted. The preparation is often minimally invasive. The technique is classic French. The flavor profile is quiet. My partner and I both wished for something a touch bolder. For example, the deviled eggs, a pre-starter, have yolks mixed with peas. We would suggest adding an acid note, perhaps a pickle. It was nice that they brought out flavored popcorn as a freebie with our drinks -- a feature at BGT. The flavor of the night was white truffle oil -- and you could taste the oil. That was a real win.For starters, my partner had the chili and cornbread, and I had the chicken liver pate with pickled onions and stewed rhubarb. I think mine was better -- really delicious, with rich, deeply flavorful pate contrasted against the rhubarb, which gave the bite the sweet and sour it needed to cut through. The farmstyle, whole grain bread had a wonderful crunch. The cornbread was a bit too refined -- it needed \u00a0more crust and less cake, more corn flavor and less cafe baked-good sweetness. The chili was savory, but mild--no real taste of chilis.The entree and dessert courses were both very good, especially dessert. My partner had the short ribs, which were beautifully medium rare -- not a hint over or under. I had the roast chicken with dumplings, which was amazingly good. Crisp skin, moist and flavorful meat, with a delicious herb broth under. Three dumplings that tasted like a delicate stuffing and had a satisfying bite. Slices of asparagus that also had a nice bite and a lovely green flavor still -- not at all cooked out. The portions seemed just right -- not too much and not too little.For dessert, my partner had the rhubarb crisp and i had the chocolate pot de creme. Both were really superb: refined, flavorful, rich, balanced. Nothing fussy -- just satisfaction in every bite, with very good coffee on the side (they use a medium blend from the Columbia Street Roastery -- a fine choice).The food is not bold. Or experimental. Or imaginative. But it is good, very good -- much better, I thought, in terms of technique than Carmon's Bistro.It's clear from the limited but well selected menu that the chef behind it is attempting to appeal to middlebrow Midwestern tastes, but doing it in such a quality way that I found it kind rather than condescending. People who don't necessarily like a chi-chi dining experience will enjoy the food, and those who do like fine dining will think it is predictable in its selections but well done nonetheless.Second, the decor and atmosphere: I generally like the blend of industrial and contemporary tavern that the interior designer seems to have been going for, although the dark colors dominate a little too much, despite the effort to add bits of fun in the lighting options. BGT has a chic, young vibe -- somewhere between casual and serious. Dark gray walls with a black drop tile ceiling, black wire-cage pendant lamps with industrial bulbs of different shapes (reminds me of the recent Restoration Hardware line), bleached branch chandeliers over the bar area, outdoor party-lights with clear exposed globe bulbs interlaced with raw blond planks (one off note: the planks have lumber-yard stamps, which may be a bit too low-end for what they were going for), \u00a0fairly inexpensive light-wood grain tables and nicely selected dark chairs--if a bit flimsy--and booth upholstery. I hope that over time BGT will invest in some better art pieces, and ones that bring more interest and warmth to the interior. There's seating outside too, if you're a smoker or don't mind getting it second hand.Third, cost: Yes, yes, it's on the expensive side. BGT is fine dining, not family dining. I won't be eating here every night either. Of course, any diner can make the meal more affordable by just sticking with an entree, rather than getting the whole shebang -- I'd guess for dinner that this would run you $20-25 tops. But if you have a deeper pocket that night, the whole shebang here could run you $100 with tip for two -- and you still won't feel cheated. The value is here, given the quality of experience.Fourth, service: BGT has a young, eager service staff. They took good care of us, and every other table I could see. From beginning to end, we enjoyed our time here.",

The staff were quite friendly and efficient, and the food was very good. Probably the highlight of the meal was the popcorn instead of bread or rolls; the night we went it was flavored with roasted fennel seed and lemon zest. I usually don't like the taste of anise, but this was really good, and we got free refills without asking.We ordered a vegetarian ragout (creamy with a hint of spiciness), the burger (it's big burger a unique taste from the mix of beef, pork, and bison), the pork shoulder (cooked perfectly), and the pork sausage (after the waitress checked on us, we discovered the root vegetables weren't cooked well enough; the dinner is on a low-carb diet and wasn't going to eat them anyway, but the waitress was very receptive when we mentioned it later). Also two beers--I can't remember which. We didn't have room for dessert, but if it's still on the menu, I want to try the spiced pumpkin bread pudding. Hello? Heaven is calling...Pros: good, local food; great staff; reasonable prices at the \"expensive for a college student\" level (c. $15 per entree)Cons: dim lighting + aging eyes + small print on the drink menu = squintingnoise level --All too often it seems that chic decor and sound-proofing are non-intersecting circles of restaurant interior design. Would it be possible to put some fabric or panels on the ceiling to absorb some of the sound?",

(And, incidentally, our server told us you made it fresh every day. \u00a0So, why didn't you just whip up a little more of the mix? \u00a0Or, does the bison truck come very morning?)We chose the Trout and the Pork Loin. \u00a0First, the portion sizes were tiny. \u00a0For the price of the trout, we expected at least half of a small trout for $18.00. \u00a0What we got was about 1/3 to \u00a01/2 of a side of a small trout. \u00a0 As for the pork, we received what amounted to about a 3 oz. portion. \u00a0Now, I understand it's local. \u00a0But, and I'm saying this as a consumer and a cook, pork is not expensive. \u00a0There is no grocery store in Champaign where you can go and find any cut of pork out pricing Beef. \u00a0 And, the accompaniments, the turnips, chicory and cornbread were nice, tasty and well presented, were cool and not substantial. \u00a0The pork, for the price, should have been at least twice the size, and even this would have made the price extravagant.We shared a bottle of white wine from the menu, the wine selection being very good by the way, and also had dessert. \u00a0I had the Ice Cream Sandwich (which should have been slightly warmed so as to not have been served rock hard), and my guest had the Pot de Cr\u00e8me. \u00a0Both were delicious!Overall, I believe our bill totaled more than $140.00. \u00a0Can you believe it? \u00a0$140.00 for two cocktails, one bottle of white wine which retailed for about $13.00, two main dishes and two desserts. \u00a0 Fine for Haute Cuisine, not fine for a tavern.We found the service to be just about perfect, as our server was attentive and respectful of both our needs and our privacy.The atmosphere is great in this place. \u00a0The food is good, but not great. \u00a0With the expanding options in the area, especially the great options across the street, there is little to nothing to draw me back to this establishment.",

Like others before me have said, I definitely appreciate their fresh, simple approach that values quality ingredients and careful preparation.Several things hold me back from a full-throated endorsement, however. \u00a0First, the prices are steep. \u00a0The one reasonably priced entree item- the burger- frequently runs out. \u00a0I'm not sure if I just hit this place at the wrong time over and over, but I've only ordered it successfully once. \u00a0They know the demand is there, so why not have more? I understand that they don't want to freeze it, or whatever, but I've hit that place at 7 o'clock, and they're out of hamburgers. \u00a0It becomes apparent pretty quickly why there's no rush to increase their supply- because every other entree costs 5 dollars more. Secondly, the other (non-burger) entrees are small. \u00a0I rarely finish my plate at ANY restaurant, but here, it's no contest; I finish it all. \u00a0Last time, I ordered the mushroom risotto. \u00a0It was AMAZING. \u00a0I loved it! \u00a0But the size of it seemed like little more than a side dish. \u00a0My S.O. and I looked at each other at the end of the meal with our empty plates between us and I could tell we were thinking the same thing - I'm still so hungry! \u00a0Afterwards, we ended up going to Merry-Ann's around the corner for chili cheese fries (our adventure at that establishment is detailed in another review).Finally, service is hit or miss. \u00a0Last time, my S.O. ordered the special. \u00a0The server said that she wasn't sure they still had the special, so he went ahead and ordered a back-up entree in case (this was his idea, not hers). \u00a0She never came back to tell us what result. \u00a0The runner came out with our food, and of course, it was not the special, but the backup. \u00a0She was busy, but it would have been nice if she had just swung by and told us that they were indeed out of the special. \u00a0I think she might have been new, because her server-patter was also wanting. (She really didn't know what to say to us when she first approached the table.) \u00a0She also forgot my Patio Pounder (a great cocktail, BTW) until I reminded her, and I only got it once I was almost done with my entree. \u00a0I had water, so it was no big deal, but the overall experience (coupled with the bill at the end) quashed the overall good vibe of the place.Before I move, I do think I will go back and give it another shot. \u00a0Their date night menu looks like a good deal, and I'm really rooting for this place to be all it can be.",

For dinner we tried 4 of the 6 starters and all I have to say is that the hash browns were excellent and I could probably eat the pickled veggies every day and never tire of them. The Pate is a must try and the deviled eggs are just perfect. We tried 4 of the soups/salads and while I was not a fan of the seared pork belly, others at the table thought it was very good but the cheesy grits on the bottom were amazing. The cornbread was delightful (almost as good as Black Dog) and the chili just right. I look forward to trying the other items. The entrees were a great size and very well done. I had the pan seared fish which was perfectly cooked and had a side of pickled veggies. The cornbread stuffing on another plate was so good. The chicken was very tasty. The steak was cooked to a great temp. We also had the mac and cheese, they seem to understand that people like cheese and bacon because this dish did not disappoint. I plan on going for dinner many times. For lunch we were disappointed that the burger had already run out but we will have to go back earlier to try it. The steak sandwich was very good but the star on that plate was the Sweet Potato Chips, they were absolutely delicious. The horseshoe was very good and I especially enjoyed the sauce. I will be heading over there again for lunch very soon.This place is a great addition to downtown Champaign and a great replacement to Jim Gould's. The decor is very well suited to the atmosphere the place is trying to convey. I love that they expanded the bar.

        "review": "With an emphasis on locally sourced foods, and a chef from California, we were hoping the local food movement could come to Central Illinois as successfully as it has in Northern California: excellent, innovative, and well prepared food that supports local farmers and ranchers while often exceeding the expectations of diners. Alas, it is not to be.In spite of many available tables, we were seated in a dark and cavernous (all in black) alcove. \u00a0Although elsewhere it was the bright light of day, we were barely able to make out the menu in the darkness. \u00a0We ordered wine by the glass to start; they waved the bottle over the glass and delivered a very small quantity for a full price pour. \u00a0Actually, I like the option of small-glass, but only if they offer the option of paying accordingly...I've had larger pours at free wine tastings around town. \u00a0Illinois is beer country, and as they are going local perhaps we would have been better to order a local brew.We waited a long time for our food, allowing our meager splash of wine to warm in the glass so as to save the few swallows to have with our meal. \u00a0At long last when it arrived, the spouse's was pleasant enough but mine was not at all as described. \u00a0I had ordered the chicken salad on wheat bread with greens; one of the few sandwiches that did not say it was served with chips. All flavors were erased by a thick layer of Dijon mustard and it was served on very dried out toast with chips on the side. \u00a0The \"greens\" were a piece of lettuce inserted between the mass of mustard and the dried out bread. \u00a0The person at the next table ordered the same dish and had the same impression, asking the waitress where the greens were and commenting on the dried out toast. It was supposed to have tarragon and other interesting ingredients, but every flavor was eclipsed by the strong Dijon mustard.Don't know if it was the worst lunch I had since moving here last summer, but it was clearly the most expensive bad lunch I have had, approaching $50 for two sandwiches--one nearly inedible--and a smidgeon of wine. This was very expensive for mixed quality, not a good value.Pluses: I like that they are trying to source from local farms, although I missed having a fish or seafood option on the menu. \u00a0The staff was very friendly. Minuses: Expensive, very small portions, descriptions on menu not accurate, food quality uneven, some bad seating locations. \u00a0I gave it two stars for the effort to source locally and the friendliness of the staff. \u00a0I a willing to give them a try again in a couple of months to see if they iron out the kinks, but only if I am feeling extravagant.",

        "review": "I love this place! Ingredients organic and locally sourced as much as possible; food as good as I've ever had anywhere.Local sourcing and the chef's own creativity mean that the the menu changes seasonally, but they seem to be keeping some staples (such as the roast chicken with dumplings, the steak, the tavern burger, macaroni & cheese...). Lots of vegetarian options, but plenty of dishes for carnivores as well. Be sure to do yourself a favor and try the gourmet deviled eggs.With everything I've ordered so far, even if there are some ingredients I'm not sure about--maybe I've never even heard of them, let alone tried them, or maybe they're being used in a combination I wouldn't have expected--when I actually try them, especially together with the other ingredients in the dish, I find that they work perfectly. Trust. However, the staff are excellent about accommodating food sensitivities and allergies as well.You might get the impression, from this review and even from stepping into the restaurant, that it could be a really snobby place--\"foodie\" in the worst sense. This could not be further from the truth. The staff have always been friendly and welcoming, very willing to explain dishes, make candid recommendations, and share interesting info about where things came from--like the lovely homemade hibiscus syrup that my party's waiter once recommended for our lemonade, which it turned out he had made himself. Sometimes I've even seen the chef take the time to come out and speak with diners.One thing to keep in mind: although no individual item on the menu seems unreasonably expensive, they can add up pretty fast. Still, I'm willing to pay for such good food, even if, on a student's budget, I can only afford it on special occasions. Lunchtime might be a good option, to help keep the bill down.All the friends and family I've taken to Big Grove, or recommended it to, have been delighted. It is definitely among the best restaurants in C-U right now.",

My friend invited me today to meet her for sushi at K.O. and I was looking forward to it. We got there at 11:15, and the server was really nice and very attentive. That's about all I can give this place. I ordered a chicken Bento box that was $15 - I cringed when I saw the price, but the server reassured me that it was \"a LOT\" of food. The box came, and it had chicken stir fry that was pretty plain. Then it had 4 little pieces of California roll that were OK. There was a lump of rice that was undercooked. There were a few pieces of lettuce with an overpowering ginger sauce on it. I'm a very hungry person and I'm the least picky eater I know, and I didn't finish the Bento box. It's not because I wasn't hungry - it's because I couldn't. But what's more, there was certainly NOT $15 worth of food on that plate -- it wasn't \"a LOT\" of food. I ordered veggie dumplings for my daughter, who seemed to liked them. I thought they were pretty good, but they were lukewarm (the server made a big deal about how hot they were - and they were definitely not). The bill came and it was almost $25. For $25, I better have eaten the very best lunch of my life!! And I would've been more satisfied with a $5 footlong, sadly. This place is ridiculous. They have some nerve to charge so much money for food that's not even up to par with cheap fast food. The other restaurants downtown, for the most part, are pretty good.

Seafood in the Midwest is absurd to purchase, so I expect it to be a little pricier, but it's fairly comparable. Today, we ordered an app, two bar drinks, three rolls and two desserts and it was $63. Not bad, IMO. I always wish the menu was more descriptive, especially about what sauces come on which rolls. I about burnt my lip off today. The service is hit or miss. Some of the staff behaves a little lofty, but maybe that's what they think people expect. Or maybe some people are just assholes.

I've had sushi in different places all over the US, and this was genuinely one of the most unduly pricey yet unremarkable meals. Kofusion is mostly about being downtown and seeing/being seen-- it's the only \"little bit of LA\" that we have, and is a good place to go for sushi & drinks before clubbing. Then the problem presents its self- where to go clubbing? lOlI visited Kofusion with two guests, with the intention of \"introducing them to sushi\"- and was really disappointed, even a little embarrassed. I feel like there are chains on the west coast like Kabuki which offer far more exciting food, dramatically bigger portions, and with less contrived pretentiousness.",

Against that backdrop, it really is filling a unique niche. East Coast + West Coast elitist diners will likely be unimpressed (if you're ensnared here for years due to work or school, the nostalgia/desperation for big city experiences might change your mind).Arguably, if you're eating at an Asian fusion restaurant, you should have no expectations of \"authenticity\" in regards to the food. The drink selection features fruity cocktails with sexy, \"exotic\" names and $9+ price tags. Many items on the menu are outright American cuisine lacking even a hint of \"fusing\" with Asian elements. In that respect, this place is ideal for groups made up of both adventurous diners and those who fear \"fish breath.\"The biggest draw for Kofusion are the Sunday and Monday $1 sushi specials. Folks with raw food aversions need not worry. All of the $1 sushi options are variations of deep-fried meats, cream cheese filling, and mayonnaise/sugary sauces. There's such a demand on these nights that the preparation definitely cuts corners--but if you're filling up on these bite-sized heart-attacks, you're likely channeling your inner fat kid and won't mind the rushed presentation.For people who love Japanese cuisine for its delicate, clean flavors, the sushi bar also serves more \"traditional\" fare, though I've sometimes received pieces of sashimi sliced rather clumsily.My advice: the $1 price tag for the Sunday/Monday specials requires such little investment that it's worth a shot for new diners. It might even be the best opportunity for initiating people who are normally turned off by the idea of sushi.",

I'd been here a long time ago (like a year and a half ago) right after the place opened, and it was kind of dead and empty. But I went again a couple of nights ago, and the place was fairly crowded and happening. I was by myself so I sat at the bar, where the bartender took very good care of me.First a few words about the place: it's fairly large, with two different seating areas separated by the bar area, and they obviously spent the bucks on the decor. It's fairly modern, with a black and dark blue color scheme, a (fairly) beautiful bar, etc... You somehow can't help thinking that maybe they tried a little too hard to look sophisticated, but nonetheless it makes for a fairly good ambiance.The food is a mix of Asian (mostly Japanese) and new American. I'm usually weary of fusion... but it wasn't bad at all. The first time I was here, I ordered the chirashi, which wasn't the best I've had in my life but was surprisingly decent considering the location (as far from any ocean as you can be in the country...). This time, I started with a seaweed salad (tasty), followed by the whole trout, which came with sauteed mushrooms and spinach... The trout was pretty good, and the veggies delicious. I finished with the black sesame ice-cream: for $4, I expected a tiny little scoop, but I was served a heaping bowl of ice-cream with a strawberry and a wafer... just great.Not to forget their drinks: they have a pretty large selection of wine and sake, as well as a full bar. I had one of their specialty cocktails (the ko-tini: sake, absolut, and peach schnapps in a martini glass... pretty good), and another mixed drink. I was especially shocked to see how inexpensive they were, being used to NY prices.Based on the food only, I would have given this place 3-1/2 to 4 stars, but the service was top notch. The bartender was extremely friendly and efficient, and treated me very well... I'll probably be back.",

Firstly, people should recognize the restaurant for what it is: Korean fushion food. Thus, there's a wide variety of sushi, my personal favorite: hwe dup bap (like sashimi salad) and a smaller selection of hot (but still great--scallops anyone?) entrees that I usually have no interest in because I love sushi that much. If you need a quick sushi fix, dollar sushi Sundays (1 roll = $1) will definitely satisfy your cravings. There are 10 rolls that are offered at that price and they are definitely more of an American style sushi roll (read: little to no raw fish). At first I was really disappointed by this, but I honestly felt like the other rolls were good enough (Big Roll! Coconut Roll!) that I didn't mind at all and eat about $15-$20 worth of sushi anyway. Yes, I am a sushi whore. If you really want good sushi (with more raw fish or more interesting combinations), Kofusion is still the place to go. Their sushi menu is surprisingly extensive with your typical simple salmon rolls to rainbow-type rolls and more. It's about $1-$2 dollars more expensive than the other places in town but I've never felt like my rolls weren't worth the cost. Finally, Kristina is my favorite waitress. Maybe she remembered me for my order (hwe dup bap--seriously, try it if you love raw fish, it is divine) or maybe because I loved her so much I tipped well, but after just a few weeks of going weekly, a lot of the waiters remembered me and greeted me warmly. As a sushi lover, it doesn't really get any better than this. I'm not going to lie, Kofusion hits your wallet pretty hard but in the world of sushi, I don't find them especially more expensive than other sushi places that offer the same variety and quality of rolls. One recommendation I have is to try and get a roll (i.e. Big Roll--that's the one I had) wrapped in soy/rice paper. For those that don't like sushi because of the seaweed, this is a great alternative. For those that still love sushi, try it anyway--it's a great substitution that's worth it to get on its own once in awhile. I will forever miss Kofusion now that I'm not in the area so please, go get the hwe dup bap, Big Roll, Coconut Roll, or even the thai curry for me please!",

If my friend and her boys weren't already there, I would have turned around and left. I got a really bad first impression. It was busy (but nobody else was at the hostess station) and the hostess asked me if she could help me. I said that I was looking for my friend and her two young sons. She got really snotty, rolled her eyes and said, \"Well, you're just going to have to look for them yourself.\" Maybe she was just having a bad day. Who knows. I walked around and still didn't see them when another hostess came up and asked if SHE could help me. I told her who I was looking for and she goes, \"Oh! I know right where they are, come with me.\" She was cheerful and really helpful. It made up for the other super, rude hostess. We had the best waiter I have ever had in this town. No kidding. I saved my receipt so I could remember his name. It was Luke H. He was super attentive, extremely polite, friendly, and really sweet to my friend's kids. Our drinks never went empty and he checked in on us plenty without being annoying or hovering. Being dollar sushi night, I expected a longer wait for our food but our rolls were out quickly. They were all really good, too. The edamame and dumplings were great, also. Super big thanks to Luke H. and the NICE hostess. Hope the other one's attitude improves.",

        "review": "Sadly, I discovered Kofusion only a couple months before I graduated but once I discovered the place, I quickly became a regular! Firstly, people should recognize the restaurant for what it is: Korean fushion food. Thus, there's a wide variety of sushi, my personal favorite: hwe dup bap (like sashimi salad) and a smaller selection of hot (but still great--scallops anyone?) entrees that I usually have no interest in because I love sushi that much. If you need a quick sushi fix, dollar sushi Sundays (1 roll = $1) will definitely satisfy your cravings. There are 10 rolls that are offered at that price and they are definitely more of an American style sushi roll (read: little to no raw fish). At first I was really disappointed by this, but I honestly felt like the other rolls were good enough (Big Roll! Coconut Roll!) that I didn't mind at all and eat about $15-$20 worth of sushi anyway. Yes, I am a sushi whore. If you really want good sushi (with more raw fish or more interesting combinations), Kofusion is still the place to go. Their sushi menu is surprisingly extensive with your typical simple salmon rolls to rainbow-type rolls and more. It's about $1-$2 dollars more expensive than the other places in town but I've never felt like my rolls weren't worth the cost. Finally, Kristina is my favorite waitress. Maybe she remembered me for my order (hwe dup bap--seriously, try it if you love raw fish, it is divine) or maybe because I loved her so much I tipped well, but after just a few weeks of going weekly, a lot of the waiters remembered me and greeted me warmly. As a sushi lover, it doesn't really get any better than this. I'm not going to lie, Kofusion hits your wallet pretty hard but in the world of sushi, I don't find them especially more expensive than other sushi places that offer the same variety and quality of rolls. One recommendation I have is to try and get a roll (i.e. Big Roll--that's the one I had) wrapped in soy/rice paper. For those that don't like sushi because of the seaweed, this is a great alternative. For those that still love sushi, try it anyway--it's a great substitution that's worth it to get on its own once in awhile. I will forever miss Kofusion now that I'm not in the area so please, go get the hwe dup bap, Big Roll, Coconut Roll, or even the thai curry for me please!",

My husband is a bit more adventurous so I like to nosh on whatever he has ordered, too. Although I have never intentionally eaten uni, I can share that my husband loves to get a piece or two whenever we come.This place also has some great entree and dessert options. They have a great wagyu beef entree with potatoes and vegetables that is absolute perfection. Additionally, they have a trio of ice creams that are so, so delicious.Drinks are always good. Service is usually pretty good (they lose a point because this is not always the case). If you do not like overstimulation, avoid Kofusion unless it is warmer out.

I also hate it when people think that this is the best Sushi place in CU without trying the others.Sushi is expensive. I also understand that not just any restaurant gets access to high quality fish, especially in bumble fuck Chambana. None of these justify the price premium KoFusion demands over the (superior IMHO) Yelowfin, not to mention the also rans Kamakura and Miko. If decor doesn't matter, and cost is an object (when is it not?) Sushi Kame is the best bet.As for their rolls, I do think they can be good. When they are good, they are just as good as the above restaurants. When they are not, they suffer the same perennial complaints for not being well rolled or being skimpy. I have not heard any complaints that their fish was bad, and I grant that this in itself is an accomplishment. The chirashi is reputedly quite good, though I have not had it.Their \"deal night\" is not really a deal. They get you in with the promise of a cheap meal, but the pieces that are $1 each are really tiny. If you are a person who normally orders 2 rolls, you will not be happy with your 10 small (but good) pieces. You will end up ordering an additional roll and maybe more. If that additional roll isn't one of the ones that are in the 10 pieces for $10 deal, prepare to wait for an eternity and a half.",

There was once that I had the best service of my life, but that was about 4 years ago. Recently I was home and went on a Sunday afternoon. Our waitress was so bad. After we had been seated for 15 min my buddy asked the host if anyone was going to wait on us. A girl came over and flatly took our drink order. After we bagan eating my same buddy had to flag the girl down every time we needed our drinks refilled. Maybe she was having a really bad day in her personal life....because she was not interested in being a waitress whatsoever. The food was good tho. Lol.And while we got shitty service it prompted us to all swap horror stories we've heard about the owner. Seems everyone in town knows someone who worked here for like a day...Or was hired at an interview and never contacted again. And is the owner un aware that the cheap plastic crap in the fish tanks looks like crystal dildos? Everyone I've taken here comments in the penises in the fish tanks.God damn it.....I'll be back....you'll be back......we just love that Big Roll for $1!!!!!!!!",

        "review": "All I can say is, this place much too overpriced for what it's trying to sell. You leave feeling like you were ripped off rather than satisfied. Sushi was very below average and I found the selection of nigiri sparse. I don't think it would have been as upsetting if it wasn't so expensive, but even if were priced less, I still cannot say that it was delicious. My bf and I had one drink, one $15-16 maki roll (only five pieces on the plate though), nigiri (2 pieces at 2 bucks a piece), and sushi plate B (which had very few actual sushi for the price) and it was around $70 something. I could not believe it because that was my grocery bill for the whole week and I got a measly meal. We both left still feeling empty in the stomach. I'm not a super chef, but I know how to cook and even to make sushi myself. The rice used was not right. Sushi rice is not the rice you just scoop out of your pot or rice cooker rolled into shapes. There is a preparation process for the rice which adds rice wine vinegar, sweetness, and brings out a slight chewiness that complements the raw fishes and whatnots. KoFusion didn't even do this.The fish was not very flavorful either. The amount of rice used for the nigiri was about 2/3 the proper amount. Rolls were shot with a shrink ray. Everything was just off. The decor was really, I dunno ... just very odd. It's the like uncool kid trying to be really cool. There was neon, walls with bubbles, odd colors, tiles, weird blue lighting, odd shapes. I dunno, maybe this is what is \"trendy\" back then or something but it looks really odd to me. The waiters were fine. i was surprised to hear that our waiter has worked there for over two years. She knew what she was doing. I'm not looking for heaping portions, exquisite tastes at dirt cheap prices. I just want a good portioned meal, tastes good to the average person, and at a reasonable price. KoFusion missed the mark on all of them. Maybe it was just that night or because of new management. I remember KoFusion actually used to be good several years ago. \u00a0I was shocked to see how different the quality of food that is being served now. Small portion, wallet shrinking, bland and poorly made sushi. Oh and odd decor.",

So, the only thing you can do is ask. \u00a0And, I would also ask whether the meat you're ordering is actually organic, because if the restaurant is willing to mislead their customers about the fish, I wouldn't trust them about the meat either!

I arrived to a beautiful restaurant with a friendly staff. I moved outside, as the night was warm. I ordered wine and asked the server to return so that I could order my appetizer. The restaurant was virtually empty, but she took a very long time. Eventually, I placed my order. I received my dinner before my appetizer. I ordered the seafood cheese springroll. It was not good. There is no other way to say it. It tasted like cream cheese in a spring roll. The crab and pollack was missing in action. I couldnt finish it and the server never asked me how it was. The entree itself, a stirfry dish with panang curry was delicious. It wasnt the best I've tasted, but it was still very good. Now..with my wine glass empty and half of my entree gone, I waited for the server to order more wine. She never came. After 20 minutes, I got up and asked the hostess for my server. The hostess was going home so couldnt help me. I waited a bit more and then asked again for the waitress. After half an hour, a young lady came out and said, I'm sorry but your server went home. The manager never came out to explain. No one asked if I needed or wanted anything. She just said, your server went home and gave me a check. I looked at the bill and realized that she had overcharged me. The seafood yuck was on the menu for $8, but she charged me $10. Then, I had to wait for her to call the manager and for him to fix the bill. Still, he did not appear in this very empty restaurant. He called from the back and said I fixed it. He took $5.00 off instead of the overcharge of $2.00. Perhaps this was to placate me. How about, Oh, I'm so sorry that we sent your server home without giving you another server. Oh, you didnt like the seafood springroll, can we get you something else instead. Nothing. I left the restaurant and determine that I would never go back again.

I spent four years in C-U, and came back here several times, most of which for Dollar Roll Night.Although many reviews have said that the service is slow, particularly on Dollar Roll Nights (Sunday and Monday nights), I have never had this experience. I would go with a friend or six, and the service was always fast enough that no one would really complain. Prices are a bit on the high side, but the quality of the food justifies that, both on and off the Sushi menu. Seriously though, the non-sushi menu is very good and highly underrated.If there is one drawback to Ko-Fusion, it is that it can get very noisy during dinner service, particularly on Dollar Roll Nights. However, the food is good, the service is not as bad as people make it out to be, and the food justifies the prices.",

I found the sauce to be too sweet, tasted like apple pie, but wasn't unpleasant when combined with the rib tips; definitely get it on the side.

I ordered a large and that looked like it was extra large!I love that the fries are actually more like wedges instead of limp soft fries here at some of the more acclaimed places in Chicago.They had great daily specials at around $5 for a meal, but I would recommend the rib tips if it's your first time. They do the ribs and chicken best in my opinion. I haven't even tried any of the other things on the menu (aside from the sweet corn)...and I don't need to.Whenever I drive to the C-U area, I have to pick up some porgies.

Frequent promotions made it hard *not* to go to Porgy's for at least some of our weekdays.Their southern sweet tea is wonderful.In comparison to the other Porgy's by the Original Pancake House; I've always thought this one to have a stronger smoky flavor.",

In my opinion, this place has one of the best smokie \"cooked on wood\" tastes in the area.I used to go a lot on Sundays for their 1/2 chicken special that included a 32oz lemonade shakeup, both which are delicious! All for under $5, this deal can't be beat. All their food has a good smoky flavor and you can order sauce in a few levels of spicyness, on the side or on your meat (usually mix is good). \u00a0Most of the items on their menu are pretty good and fresh if you go during the lunch/dinner hours, although the beef ribs might be a little dry at times.All their entrees comes with an order of fries and are served on a tray with paper and foil, basic but gets the job done. The place is quite small and dirty, but the aroma of the smoked wood and the style of food makes it seem more authentic.The quality of food might not be the best, but if you account for their fast service, killer sunday special, good sauce and CHEAP food, this place is definitely for you. In my opinion best bbq \"hole in the wall\" as of now in Chambana.",

When I come here, I get whatever is on the daily special (a menu item with a 10% off price). \u00a0Everything is great, as long as you come at the right time. \u00a0As usual with any BBQ place, you really need to come during lunch/dinner rush hours to have perfectly smoked meat (another 2-3 hours waiting in the smoker will easily dry out the meat). The meat is served with 2 pieces of plain Butternut-looking bread, and steak fries. You can substitute the steak fries for another side if you wish ( I usually pick the baked beans, which seems like they are from a can).The sauce here is delicious! You can pick from Mild, Mixed, Hot, or Xhot Even if you are scared of a little spice, I would at least get Mixed--the mild is way to sweet for my taste. \u00a0Watch out the the X-hot, it's very spicy stuff. \u00a0I am a spice head and usually get the Hot. \u00a0I can handle the X-hot but I reserve it for when I want to be sweating afterwards.Prices are great here! You would be hard pressed to find cheaper well-smoked 'cue anywhere else. \u00a0I really don't get everyone's obsession with Black Dog--I feel that they oversmoke their food and overcharge for the small amount that you get there.Bottom line: Real hickory-smoked barbecue for a great price. \u00a0Sides are mediocre, but sauce is great.",

Prices are very good for downtown Champaign, but they lack the booze selection of a Radio Maria or Blind Pig. The gross looking jar on the bar is infused vodka.Service is always friendly, and fastest at the bar. If you sit at their pretty awesome outside tables, the trade off is that you're gonna get ignored. You can order lunch ahead and pick up 15 minutes later. The free peanuts are priceless, as are the friendly patrons who are more likely than other crowds in town to strike up a convo with you.

I came here with my mom and sister to grab some food on Sunday. It seemed to be the only place open. I ordered the portabella mushroom sandwich (super bland), my sister got the chicken salad (she said it was pretty good), and my mom ordered the salmon.Overall the food was nothing special to me however coming from the city to this little suburb area the price for the food was pretty amazing. The salmon only cost $7 and it was a fairly big portion. The servers were nice but the atmosphere was too load. I wont be back here but that mostly has to do with the lack of food options.",

I guess some people don't mind having a communal condiments station but I have a problem with this. The fresh produce like pickles, onions, and lettuce are not refrigerated at all at the communal condiments station. I mean at least puts some cold ice under the box of pickles, lettuce, and onions at least! The ketchup bottle and mustard container all looked like it was ready for the dump. The tips were hardened and crustified and it just looked out of date because no one bothered to keep em clean. Stickyness galore. Wash your hands if you still decide to go. Anyway, minus food but fun joint. Proceed with caution cuz after a few beers you might just make a drunk order of food and realize you got yourself into a bigger mess then you had planned.",

You could say I grew up throwing peanut shells on the floor and stomping on them. (For the record, I still throw the shells on the floor, but I no longer do the accompanying dance--that stopped being cute around age eight.) Before my family moved away from Champaign, this was the number one place we would take out of town relatives visiting. Even as objectively yummier, cooler places opened up around town, Aunt So-and-so and Uncle Whatshisface would always demand to be taken back to Esquire, and we were always happy to oblige. It's a comfortable, unpretentious bar, and that's what you needs sometimes.It's all about the ambiance, really. There are better burgers in town, but at Esquire it's the whole package that keeps me coming back. That and those peanuts. For real.",

I haven't tried the pizza yet, but that's because I've been unimpressed by the other stuff I have tried. The appetizers tend to be greasy, and the chicken fingers were weak.

It's also the place I had my first legal drink, the place I arranged my first (extremely underwhelming) one-night stand, the place I had my first post-breakup talk ... the list goes on and on. In short, the Esquire is a place of firsts for me, and for that reason it holds an unimpeachable place in my heart.It's a good place, even taking none of the above into account. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly, the drinks are stiff, the food is tasty, the jukebox kicks much ass (except on one night a few years back when some doucherocket fed about a million dollars into the machine and played Pogues records all night, but I am willing to let bygones be bygones). There's a nice array of seating options: small tables, mid-size tables, large booths, and the bar itself, which is the best place to sit if you want super-fast service and a good vantage point for eavesdropping and people-watching. There are also some tables outside, which are nice places to park your ass if you're a smoker or like keeping an eye on the goings-on along Walnut. The outdoors is heated during chilly weather, and although it doesn't too a ton of good in the dead of winter, it's lovely on brisk autumn nights.The people who frequent this place are an interesting mix. Some townies, some students, some regulars, some noobs. You're just as likely to see a gaggle of hipsters looking vaguely out of place as you are to see a group of middle-aged business types in dad jeans. Every once in a while some truly fresh and interesting personalities will be present, such as a trio of cackling cougars sipping pineapple margaritas and flirting with any male under the age of 26, or two sharply-dressed men having a snappy but ultimately friendly conversation you ache to be a part of, or a crusty old man with a walrus mustache who will pound your table with a hammy fist and yell something that sounds friendly but is completely unintelligible. Oh, and every once in a while Tim Lash of Hum fame will be hanging around, which I think we can all agree is pretty delightful. (I do not advocate drunkenly pestering him, of course, but if you do want to say hi be assured that he's about the nicest dude on earth and will receive your attention with much grace and warmth.)One of the best, most endearing things about this bar is its all-around friendliness. I often go here by myself in the evening with whatever book I'm currently reading, fold myself into a corner, and order a few beers. Not once has any patron or staff member given me grief over this, and for that I am truly grateful. Yes, the linoleum is hideous and yes, the bathrooms are a little iffy, but all the bartenders remember my name, and that's something that can't be beat.",

I sat by myself at the bar, but there were plenty of others riding solo as well. It was THAT kind of place - where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows. Actually, it was much more than that - this place seems to have a little bit of everything. There are pool tables in the back, so you can get that sort of crowd. There are larger tables as well, so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away. There are a good amount of TV's, so there were some people watching the evening college football games. There are decent sized booths, so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops. And there's a jukebox, so some people are silently rocking out to the classics. And perhaps best of all, there were plenty of townies around for some great people watching. At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem. Although he didn't get the words right, I gave him an A+ for effort. The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay. It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends, and even the students are cool with the townies.The beer selection was surprisingly good. There were a lot of good import options available, although I stuck with $2.25 Bud Light drafts. Remember, I was taking the Amtrak home, so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend.... They have $1.50 PBR drafts too, which is what the locals stuck to. The food was pretty good as well. I had a simple cheeseburger and fries. Although not my favorite burger/fries combo, it was definitely worth the $4.50 I paid. The \"fixin's table\" they have is nothing more than onions, pickles, and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces - Nothing special there. But there was something cool about being able to put that stuff on yourself, I guess.The charm of this place lies in the characters that visit, and for that alone, I am giving a 5 star rating.

The chicken must be avoided at all costs.The sandwich is one of those strange creations that takes chicken strips and puts them on a bun.

        "review": "What a lovely place to grab a leisurely, hearty breakfast or brunch. While yes the place is technically a diner, it's really the only one I've ever seen that could be said to offer some historical interest as well; as the back of the menu describes in detail, the place used to be the home of the Courier Newspaper. Much of the decor hanging on the walls has some historical significance, which was so cool! Perfect place to bring an out-of-towner.The food was really delicious. I ordered a Spanish omelette, which was HUGE and came with potatoes and a choice of homemade bread (I chose sourdough bread). The potatoes came diced, and were fried slightly soft--almost like very very tender McDonalds hashbrowns. Not my preferred breakfast potato style, but I'll take it!! The omelette was my favorite part--stuffed with fresh jalapenos, onions, chorizo, and Chihuaha cheese. And so cheap, too! 8-ish bucks for a very generous meal.But the best part of the meal: the truly great service (particularly in contrast to the brunch experience I had had just the day before elsewhere, in Champaign). I don't remember her name, but our waitress just beamed amiable Midwest charm, and was very competent about getting us refills and keeping us apprised of the status of our dishes when there was a bit of a wait to get our food. My friend who brought us to this place has stories of how this same waitress would bring her hot tea with lemon when she was feeling ill.I believe it. And I'd gladly come back next time.",

It was a splurge for me then, though I'm sure that the prices were as low as they are today. Now, it was time to bring my niece here, the night before she registered for her classes and we took a tour of my old abode, Allen Hall, which is now her casa for the next year. \u00a0And I guess it was our lucky day: I tried the coin-op crane and scooped up a prize, she got to chew the gummy fruits of my lucky labor. I had the quesadilla, which was large and tasty. Don't expect it to have the authenticity of M\u00e9xico; I wouldn't expect it to in a place so resplendent in Americana. But the American adaptation was a treat.Near a campus that has changed from mom & pop restaurants, it's very much worth the trek to get some home-style cooking in a historic, small business.",

Inside was kind of small, old, rustic/historic looking, but still kinda cute. We were initially seated in the back room by the salad bar, but opted for a table change since my folks are unusually picky about the location of their table. \u00a02 family members began with a trip to the salad bar, which had a variety of everything and is priced by weight, including some remarkably good cold pasta salad in kind of a red cream sauce. My mother had the cream of (I can't remember) soup, which had potatoes and peppers in it, which she said was pretty good. My father enjoyed his turkey club, which looked really good and was pretty large in size. Also, my Mom said her reuben was decent as well. I ordered a build-your-own 1/2 pound burger which was on special that day for only $6, which was quite the meal deal. The options for building a burger were over 30, and I elected a strange, (but really tasty) combination of chiuahah (spell check?) cheese, a fried egg, pico de gallo and black beans, almost going for a southwestern style thing. This monstrosity of a sandwich was delicious, and was even better when I put on the included lettuce, tomato and onions. I also had a side of cole slaw, which was surprisingly yummy as well. My brother said he liked the buffalo chicken wrap, but wished the sauce was on the inside so he could eat it like an actual wrap and not have to cut it up with silverware. Other than that, no complaints on the food. Unfortunately, we did not try any of the deserts or baked goods on display, which looked fantastic, even some old-fashioned milkshakes served in the silver glasses as well as in-house cookies and cakes.Our server was friendly and polite. It seemed that they were a little understaffed on the holiday, so our check came out a bit slow, but that would be my only minor gripe with our dining experience. Now that I go to school in the area, I will definitely have to come back for breakfast and the desert items. The Courier surprised me as a fairly inexpensive diner-style place with in-house baked goods and a variety of tasty food. If only it were located closer to campus, perhaps on Green street, that would be the ideal location!Either way, we had a very pleasurable experience at the Courier and I'll be back.",

We asked her to bring plain butter rather than their money-saving \"mystery butter blend\", and she was making a face and saying \"Oh I'm not sure I can do that\", despite the fact that they have pure butter at hand. She was selective about who she served and was overall rude.-(Kicking customers out the door) Then Chuck, the manager, and his waitress came up to our table well before closing hour and started moaning about how he is closing soon and was trying to kick us out in advance!-(Ignoring customers) The last time we came here, we sat outside as the waitress Nicole was serving someone else. Although we said \"hi\", *she blatantly ignored us* and we had to walk into the restaurant and talk to the manager JUST TO PLACE OUR ORDER. It was so bad. We watched the manager baby-sit the waitress as he told her \"you have customers waiting for you, Nicole.\"But she had seen us before and consciously ignored us.A few minutes after we came back out to dine outside, Nicole (the waitress) walked towards us and gave us a very phony smile. -(Insolent manager) On this other occasion, Chuck (The Manager) was chatting with us after dinner and he called my friend a \"Liar\" simply because he was trying to get him to guess where we were from. He also called us \"Disingenuous\" for the same reason.-(Summary) Overall, The Courier Cafe has great food, but due to a grumpy and harassing Manager, and rude waitresses who need to be *told* that they have tables waiting for them, we are strongly considering never dining there again.",

        "review": "The other night, my girlfriend and I went out to the Courier Cafe in downtown Urbana. Having been there before, I knew that it was a good place to go for a relatively cheap meal (which is why I capitulated rather quickly). Courier Cafe is one of the older restaurants in downtown Urbana, having been open since 1980. As such, it has outlasted many other downtown Urbana businesses, and enshrined their memory in the names of its burgers.Speaking of burgers, they are the primary reason I go to the Courier Cafe. Burgers are around $5-6, and are 1/3 of a pound. The burgers also tend to be higher quality than the standard pub fare, considering people go there for food, instead of ordering a burger as an afterthought.On this night I opted for the Darcy's burger, which is a burger with mushrooms and bleu cheese. The burger comes on a plate with all of the other assorted toppings, including onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and pickles, off to the side, so you can add them to taste. The burger comes well done unless you specify otherwise. The meat itself is relatively juicy for being a grilled burger, and the bun tastes more like it came from a genuine bakery, instead of a store-brand 8 pack of buns, which often ends up being the case in burger restaurants.Another thing Courier is known for is its old-style sweet drinks, such as its phosphates and New York egg creme drinks. These are sugary soda-type drinks with flavored syrup, with the egg creme being a phosphate with an egg cracked into it and creme added. Courier also has a variety of ice cream desserts.Courier's wine and beer menu is not very extensive, but they have had Rogue Dead Guy on draft for $4 the last few times I have gone, which is cheaper than most bars in the area. In addition, their bottled beers are relatively cheap, and the wine by the glass is inexpensive as well. Though the menu is not extensive, there is a good enough variety to please most individuals.For two people with burgers, drinks, and one order of fries, the total bill ended up being $18.84. This is much lower than one would pay for an equivalent meal anywhere else, even a place like Murphy's (which has a similar food menu, though lower quality food). Courier is a perfect spot for a cheap date, where your date won't know you're being cheap unless you let her see the check.",

For those of you that aren't familiar, the chocolate egg cream, originating in New York (as far as I've heard), contains milk (not cream), chocolate syrup, and seltzer. That's right, no egg. The egg creams at Courier are delicious, however, you should all know, they are NOT authentic egg creams as they contain egg whites to help the top foam up. At any rate, very few places these days have egg creams, so it's great that this place still does. (But if nowhere near you has them and you want to try, they're way easy to make. My version: Fill a glass 1/3 with milk, add syrup til liquid height is 1/2 up the class, fill the rest of the way with seltzer, stir, taste, add more syrup if you wish!)",

The Banker's Burger is fantastic, the Monkey Stuff sandwich sounds weird, but is amazing. Some of the sandwiches are obscene in their size. Asking for a side of mayo is a mistake as they will bring you a 1/4 of mayo. The sweet potato chips are delicious. They also have a salad bar that has a decent selection.But ignore all of what I said above because none of it matters. Even if Courier had the worst lunch and breakfast food on earth, I'd still go for the shakes. Oh my god the shakes. I get the shakes thinking about their shakes. Feeling like a high roller? Order the apple pie shake. Some of the waitresses will not know what you are talking about, but once you explain it to them, they will make it. Piece of apple pie + ice cream + blender = apple pie shake. They will charge you for both a slice of pie and a shake, and it is worth every penny. Great to take your date who isn't watching her figure (or is way too damn skinny and needs to bulk up a bit). Seriously, stop reading and go get an apple pie shake!",

The soup was black bean soup: it was actually quite tasty, and the portion was huge (I expected just a small bowl, since it was supposed to be a side). I was almost full after finishing the soup and when the pork chops arrived, and that was a good thing because I was not too impressed by them... grilled pork chops lathered in bbq sauce, really nothing too exceptional, and the little side of salad that came with it didn't even have any dressing. So... the portion were huge, it was pretty cheap (I think I ended up paying under $15 including a soda), but the food did not impress me much. The service however was pretty friendly.

What I got in return was the bland little sad looking piece of fish about the size of a playing card. It was cod. It was flavorless. It was served with thin slices of lemon on top of it. It served no purposes other than to falsely suggest there would be some lemon-y taste. Also on the plate were three slices of cucumber and a slice of tomato. Not sure why. Perhaps it was there so that I could rate which item was the most bland on the plate.I have been to courier cafe a few times, and I've always ordered some sort of burger or sandwich. They always came out as expected for a sandwich. It tasted good and it was filling. This on the other hand, left me disappointed as I compared the value and price of my meal against my friend who ordered a sandwich that costed less. I left the restaurant hungry and actually went to another nearby restaurant to eat again.",

Fortunately, we arrived early enough not to have to wait for a table, because this place got crowded really quickly. (For good reason!) I had a courier burger (burger with bacon) with fries and coleslaw. I really appreciate how they put the burger toppings on the side of the plate, because it lets you assemble the burger however you want to, and makes the dish more presentable. The burger came out very neat and clean; I didn't have to deal with a sauce-filled, drippy mess, like some other places. It was all very appetizing, though nothing to write home about. I would avoid the coleslaw, however, which was disastrously drenched in mayonnaise, and after a few bites, I just set it to the side untouched. I totally dig the antique-style decor in this restaurant. This is one of Urbana's landmark establishments; if you're looking for a place to enjoy a cozy meal with friends, definitely make a trip over here.",

I ended up ordering the Banker's Burger @ about $ 5.00(1/3 patty, swiss, mushroom, tomato on a toasty bun)and sweet potato fries for additional dollar. \u00a0Thank goodness the burger was delicious, because despite my friend and I getting there so early, it took almost a half hour for our food to come. The patty was done just perfectly, \u00a0and sat happily in my tummy. The sweet potato fries I wasn't too fond of though; they were more chips than fries. \u00a0Some of them were rather brown and burnt- the more orange coloured ones were really good, the crispier burnt ones left a very strong taste of charcoal in my mouth. \u00a0But overall, I would come again. The servers were slow, but very friendly. \u00a0And really, the price I paid for a whole VERY filling meal (about $7.50) was extraordinarily within my budget. =]",

Service here is cheerful, friendly and professional, and both the hostess and waitress greeted us when we entered. We skipped the homemade pastries and muffins, as they're not on the diet right now, but they looked great. I had an omelet with spinach, mushrooms and cheddar and it was very good, with very fresh veggies. The hash browns they serve are delicious...crispy without and fluffy within. They make their own bread and I tried the cinnamon toast, which was a white bread that my baker husband says was brioche dough, and made for some great toast. He tried the oatmeal with fresh berries and walnuts, which was made with whole oats. The regular size is a very good sized serving of oats...you can get a half order if you're appetite is smaller. I asked of they use real butter...I'll order my toast dry before I'll eat margarine...and she assured me they do, which I greatly appreciate. Two thumbs way up for this delish breakfast.

Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and very patient. If I could rate service separately, it would be a 5-star rating.-Decor: I like it! The theme seems to be old-timey newspaper, which is pretty cool. -Milkshake. Mr. Boyfriend and I got a peanut butter to split, and our friends got butterscotch. Awesome.-The \"Skinny Dippers,\" crispy, fried potato skins covered with cheese, bacon, sour cream and chives. These will make a person anything but skinny. We got a half-order to split, and ended up with approximately a bazillion potato skins. Wow.-Food in general: pretty good! -Menu: Quaintly themed, with desserts named after newspaper stuff (\"Headliner,\" \"Misprint,\" \"Cub Reporter,\" etc...). Standard American fare, sandwiches, burgers, etc.Cons, Almost-Cons, Slight Issues:-Price: It wasn't terribly overpriced for being right in downtown Urbana. I'm willing to pay $5.75 for a BLT. I just want the BLT to be a great BLT. The BLT was a good BLT, but it was a $4 BLT. Tiny slice of tomato, lots of lettuce, some decent bacon, on basic slices of wheat bread. The skins were $4.95, and these are SO worth it to split with a group, because of how good they are and how many we received. Milkshake was $3.75, I believe. Altogether, Mr. Boyfriend spent around $30 before tip for the two of us. -Timing: We arrived at 12:10, ordered by 12:15, and were served at 12:45. I had to be back at work by 1, so I had hoped the food would come out more quickly. This isn't a terrible wait, and like I said, the restaurant was doing good business. Still, I had ten minutes to eat, but 30 to talk.

Sunday morning brunch after V-day with the boy seemed like a good option. It was pretty hoppin and the inside was just what I expected it to be: very cute and eclectic, smattered with antiques (but not in the Cracker Barrel way.. in the authentic way), and cozy. Because the menus on the website don't say when breakfast ends and lunch begins, we weren't sure if we would have the option of choosing from either menu. We got there at around 11:35, and the hostess gave us menus with just breakfast. The menus are large, so if you take a while to decide (especially during brunch time...) be careful. Our waitress stopped by once immediately after we were seated to get our drink orders, and once about five minutes later. We told her we needed a few minutes. She came back shortly after and snapped at us, saying that they were only serving breakfast for 5 more minutes so we needed to order then. This was at around 11:45. I understand wanting to expedite things, but if the switch was happening at 11:50 shortly after we arrived, I think we should have been told by the waitress or the hostess that lunch was about to start (after we had been seated I saw people ahead of us getting salads and soups, but no lunch option was given to us). Anyway, he got the breakfast burrito and I got the breakfast sandwich. His was very good and enormous! The salsa verde was perfect.. I didn't even know I liked salsa on eggs. I think I just misordered in my haste. The croissant was not from their bakery.. it had the \"I came out of a cellophane wrapped plastic container from Sam's\" taste, but it was large.. just not a real croissant. The eggs were another problem: they were a consistent yellow color and had rounded borders. Not real scrambled eggs.. or maybe real but reconstituted. The bacon was tasty, the hashbrowns mushy. Not worth $7. He gave me half of his burrito in exchange for half of mine. I greatly benefited from the unfair trade! I really want to like this place, so I'll try it again in the next few weeks! Hopefully I'll get a smiley waitress. FYI: prices are a little higher than those listed on the online menu (but only about 50-60 cents).",

I like the potato pancakes at the original pancakes a little bit better. The parking lot provided by the restaurant was full the first time we came so we had to part across the street at the meters so that was a little bummer. Overall the food is okay but i really like the environment and the water. They have this really cool gum ball machine but it's kinda broken so you would have to ask the hostess for a gum ball.

We also got 3 empanadas for $6 to go with it, delivery time was about an hour, which is to be expected on a weekend. This amount of food was just enough for our group of 3 in terms of portions.The pizza was decent, definitely better than a Papa John's or similar chain. I didn't think it was anything spectacular though. If you like thin crust, this might be for you. It reminded me of Sbarro, except a little better. My issue with this pizza, and perhaps all thin crust/New York style is the lack of sauce. The sauce is so key to the flavor that often times without it your just eating a cheesy breadstick. I might have liked it more if there was a bit more sauce. The pepperoni wasn't that good, however, the sausage was unusually good, it tasted fresh and wasn't just a mushy piece of nothing, great flavor! I think I will get sausage if I order again. The crust was good, crispy bottom but edible edges.Feedback on the empanadas was a unanimous OK. I can only personally speak for the cheesecake empanada. The filling didn't resemble something you could get at The Cheesecake Factory, but it also wasn't just dried goop. Not too bad! I think the empanadas might be a really good bargain if you got a lot of them and the price was around $1 each.I have not tried any of the specialty pizzas and I may have to do that and then update my review. I will also have to try The Empanadas House for a fair comparison.Overall we thought Manolo's was just OK, we thought it might have been just a little pricey, but we were not disappointed with our food.I'll be back!",

Otherwise, plain cheese is good enough.I've had the empanadas, and they're also pretty good. Problem is, they're too expensive for what you get. More than $7 for three measly little pockets of meat/cheese/veggies is a bit much. I suppose the San Termo style empanadas warrant a try, but for the more standard varieties, I wouldn't bother.

I prefer the empanadas from a new food truck called Empanada house, where the crust is about 2 mm thick and the filling isn't dry.

        "review": "Empanadas are pretty easy to make. You have your filling - usually some kind of meat, some spices, onions, make it the night before, stick it in the fridge - and you have your shells - usually made out of masa harina. When you're ready to serve them you plop a spoonful onto the shell, roll it up, squeeze the edges and drop them into the fryer.It's not haute cuisine. Every culture has some kind of dough-and-filling staple whether it be Polish pierogis or Chinese dumplings. It's so basic it's hard to believe anyone could fuck it up.Unfortunately, someone has. These are, by far, the worst dough-and-filling creations I've ever had. The dough was soggy, the filling was dry, it was paradoxically bland and salty. The mushrooms in the mushroom and cheese empanada tasted like they were on the verge of going bad. Also, they should be fried. Not baked. Granted, I ate the empanadas during Thanksgiving break when not many students are on campus so maybe the management didn't really think it'd be worth it to make fresh empanadas. Then again, empanadas should never be made hours beforehand to sit under a heat lamp. You want to save money? Close up shop instead of serving an inferior product.Finally, it was overpriced (3 little empanadas for 6 bucks) and the service was lousy. The place felt kind of disorganized and grimy, the employees were lackadaisical. I don't expect the corporate shine and whitewash of a Jimmy John's. A little dirt can be ok, I appreciate texture, but I also like a little bit more professionalism. If the owner wants to make some real money I'd say get rid of the pizza, get rid of all the empanda options except for maybe the top two flavors (a spicy ground pork one Colombian style and maybe a vegetarian option), reduce your staff, get an industrial deep fryer, drop the price of each empanada to $2, make it three for $5, offer free salsa to top on the empanadas and stay open really late on the weekends. Let the smell of the fried goodness waft over the street and watch people line up outside of your door. Empanadas are blue-collared, street food in Latin America. They're also great when you're drunk or high and got the munchies. This place should be so much better.",

The Modena was definitely the standout, but again, I would trust goat cheese with my firstborn.

Hard to tell, and I don't want to think about it too much! All I know is they definitely gave us one meaty empanada when we ordered two vegetarian ones-- major problem!!They also had a lot of problems charging our credit card. They tried three times, and we got all these fraud alerts afterward.BUT they were running a deal where you got a free medium cheese pizza when you spent $10... And they gave us two! (We did spend over $40).My brother was really excited to share this place with us, and he doesn't get excited about too much food-wise, so that of course made the whole experience a full star better!",

One let out a guffaw and snorted, \"Look, [person B], that Korean girl is checking you out. Hahahaha...\" First of all, I'm Chinese American. If you're going to judge my ethnicity, at least get it right. Second of all, who treats a paying customer like a gawking idiot like they did? I almost wanted to throw the empanadas I bought back in the cashier's face.

While I haven't eaten through the amazing range of items Manolo's offers, I am confident Manolo's is the best of the two.Pizza places are ubiquitous on college campuses, so I'm never too excited when one springs up. Manolos sets itself apart by having empandas, which are an excellent alternative to pizza. They have several types ranging from the more authentic spicy San Telmo Carne to flaming potato. The three types I tried were tasty and the pastry was puffy and soft. They are perfect for an on-the-go snack since they can easily be eaten while walking.As for the pizza? The cheese pizza I tried was good and had a nice crust. \u00a0Hands down the best pizza there (and the reason for the recently added extra star) is the fresh basil and mozzarella. I had it with some friends and we all agreed it was top-notch. It's fragrant from the very fresh basil and the cheese stands out as being so much better than regular pizza cheese. Specialty pizzas are a little bizarre. The one I tried, creamy chicken gorgonzola, was sans red sauce. It wasn't bad, but it was like some cheese, chicken, spinach, and (good) portabellas on dough. More like upscale breadsticks than pizza. Make sure the description says it has red sauce if you are looking for something traditional. Ditto the other reviewer- They make their food! Surprisingly enough, this is actually unusual. Many restaurants buy pre-made items from big companies, but here at Manolos you can see them rolling the dough for all the pizza and empanadas.Delivery is slow and expensive.

I've been there many times since a friend turned me onto it and the food has always been delicious. The almond-crusted goat cheese salad is one of my favorite menu items. It has one of the best balsamic dressings I've ever tasted and the combination of almonds, warm goat cheese, dressing and the crunchy salad is perfect. Also try the grilled cheese with apple slices and fig jam inside. You'll be glad you did.I've had a few cheese plates and their selection of cheese spreads and have been impressed every time. When they have special selections of cheeses they are always well-selected and make for a fun lunch or dinner as they usually range from the more mild to the more adventurously pungent.If I have one complaint, it's that the service is slow. There is a very relaxed atmosphere in general there and as long as you leave yourself plenty of time you'll have an enjoyable time. I would not recommend going there if you're in a hurry though. They're staff seems fairly small no matter how busy they are and everything comes to your table at a leisurely pace. If you have an hour for lunch or are not on your way to a movie after dinner though, you should be fine.After you're done, be sure to check out the wine selection. The staff is incredibly helpful in selecting a good wine and will not judge you if you don't know a great deal about wines in general.

We were promptly seated (we had reservations) at a beautifully set table right by the window. For starters I ordered a negroni and she had a glass of white wine. We then ordered our meal: pizzetta with zucchini and burrata as our antipasto, bucatini and fusili as our primi, and salmon and scallops as our secondi. The appetizer was a little underwhelming, not enough burrata in my opinion. The first plates were very, very good and reminded us both of Italy. There was however, one issue: my girlfriend's plate of fusili came with a hair on it. We told the waitress and she immediately took care of it and was extremely apologetic - very professionally handled. \u00a0Our second plates were even better than the first. The salmon and scallops were cooked to perfection and left us both wanting more.We finished the night with a caff\u00e8 corretto (on the house). They also gave my girlfriend a birthday present of chocolate dipped biscotti which was very thoughtful and a nice finishing touch to a wonderful night.The unfortunate fact that we got a hair on one of our plates and I am still leaving a 5 star review should speak volumes about this restaurant's quality of food and service.",

The servers are among the most professional in the C-U area. The food is genuinely sophisticated. However Bacaro's commitment to local, seasonal ingredients, while being one of its strengths, is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The menu at Bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock. This tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing. Of three visits I've eaten some bad, ok and great meals.Visit 1:Had halibut with some kind of crust in a mint-gazpacho. The fish was fresh and of excellent quality. This was frustrating however because the fish was coated in a greasy crust that became soggy from the fish sitting in the mint gazpacho. The gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty. What could have been a complex, herbaceous broth, wound up tasting like greasy mouthwash. Fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep.Visit 2:Valentine's Day prix-fixe. Three courses all of which were delicious. The appetizer was some kind mediterranean type salad if I recall with olives and I think preserved lemon. Delicious and fresh! My main was halibut again, with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey. My girlfriend got the steak and it was of great quality with a strong preparation to match. The dessert was a chocolate torte with blood orange sorbet- good flavors that were well-executed.Visit 3:Pork loin with mustard spaetzle. The spaetzle were delicious! I could eat that spaetzle every day. The pork however was DRY. Really, really dry. I was trying to conserve the mustard sauce on the plate in order to make sure there was enough to get on each slice of pork. It was that dry. So in closing out of three, expensive visits, the food has been good maybe 1.5 times- with me being able to say I enjoyed one complete meal (valentine's day) and the side of one of my mains (the spaetzle). If the food was consistent, Bacaro would be an easy 5-stars. Hopefully they can strike a balance moving forward between rotating fresh, seasonal ingredients and maintaining a consistently-executed menu.",

Well, Bacaro certainly deserves it: I finally went there for dinner last night (after wanting to go for several months), and I was wowed. I'm still salivating thinking about it.I went there with pretty high expectations (I'd heard great things about it from several friends and coworkers): that's usually not a good thing as it makes it easier to be disappointed, but Bacaro did not disappoint. In fact, I'm happy to say that my dinner there was on a par with my best dining experiences in NYC.First and foremost: the food. My boyfriend and I decided to share a bunch of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, as well as the roasted suckling pig with homemade sauerkraut: they were both absolutely delicious (don't miss the suckling pig!). We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding. That was some seriously great food!!As Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty good. Not to forget the 10yo port we got with our dessert (very generous pour...), which was good also.Service was great, ambiance was great (although it's a shame that the place was so empty)... it was really a great dinner (sure, it was not cheap, but entirely worth it!).

The kind of food that makes you say \"ohhhh god\" after every bite. For Central Illinois it may be a splurge, but I'm telling you, eating here is worth 100 meals at Destihl or Radio Maria or Seven Saints or Guido's or any of those other totally mediocre downtown restaurants.Bacaro also seems unpretentious. It's definitely upscale, but I feel completely comfortable going in there in jeans and moccasins and unbrushed hair. (...Or maybe I'm just an oblivious slob.) Oh, and maybe this is irrelevant for a restaurant review, but I have to mention that once I was there the night a guy proposed to his girlfriend, and the restaurant sent out glasses of champagne to every customer in there. You also get amuse bouches before dinner and little homemade dessert bites with your check. I love touches like that.My one complaint is that it's harder than it used to be to get a good boozy cocktail here. There used to be some talented cocktail guys behind the bar. Recently I went in and ordered a Manhattan, \u00a0a totally standard cocktail, and the bartender had to look up the recipe in a book. So I stick to wine and resign myself to the fact that you really can't get a great whiskey cocktail anywhere in Champaign-Urbana.For me the ultimate test is: If this restaurant were in Chicago, a city full of fine dining spots, how would I rate it? Without hesitation, Bacaro would get five stars.",

The decor had a lot to be desired, but the wait staff were great. However, once we ordered wine (and, by the old menu at least, were supposed to receive the standard 4oz glass) things went downhill. While we were savoring the tiny portion in our glasses, the bartender was doing his best to overfill the glasses of the pretty girls at the bar. When questioned, we were told \"they asked for doubles.\" Who orders a double Merlot? We chose what appeared to be a special at the time: a smoked duck panini. What arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. No, I'm not complaining about the sandwich itself, but they had substituted ham instead of smoked duck, then claimed that I wouldn't know the difference. I'm not sure if it was just this visit or the one that followed that biased me, but I'll never return.",

So before we set out on a Friday night for Bacaro, I decided to Yelp it and I was (and still am) very suspicious of a few of the reviews. Here was a place with lots of 1 & 2 star reviews and yet a couple of 5 star reviews, written in great length and gushing detail by Yelpers for whom this was their only review. \u00a0So who writes their first and only review in great length and never mentions anything they ordered, just summarizing it as an excellent restaurant, then never subsequently reviews any other restaurant? \u00a0I may be a cynic, but it raises red flags....So, we set off to do our own independent research: \u00a0Three people on a Friday night. \u00a0The place is full, we get one of a couple of available tables, with no reservations. \u00a0The waitress was wonderful. \u00a0My first requirement to enjoy a restaurant experience is good service, and she was great. \u00a0She knew the menu, she was unequivocal when we asked her what she liked. \u00a0She kept her distance and watched us for cues, never interrupting a conversation and never rushing us nor ever making us wait.The wine list is huge, the drink list is equally huge, but both are very pricey by Champaign standards. My wife's martini was a very full glass, all the way up to the \"c\" section as we Assembly Hall fans would say.We had a risotto special with fish \"for the table\", one mixed green salad, and one fried pork belly starter. \u00a0The pork belly was $10 and was the size of a large marshmallow in the center of a 12 inch plate, humorous by its dinkyness. But good, like a chunk of fried bacon fat.Then we had three entrees, all were very good. \u00a0Mine was the grouper ($28) and frankly I don't recall my companion's meals because we also knocked down one martini and two bottles of Cote D' Rhone between the three of us. \u00a0The Cote D' Rhone was $28/bottle and the lowest price wine on the list. \u00a0Several other wines could be had in the high $30's, and then the rest of the list was north of $40.One apple pie ala mode later and the three of us were out of there for $192 before tip; and she was worth the $40 tip we left, so by the end of the day it approached $77 per person.So if you start a Yelp review at a three, this place gets one more star for having a great server, one star for being in DT Champaign and being beautiful inside & out, including cloth hand towels in the loo. \u00a0Then I'll knock one star off for being too pricey for the market, but if Yelp allowed half-stars I'd give Bacaro 4.5.",

Outside of Daniel, in New York City, I don't think I've had food this subtle, refined and exquisite anywhere else - something I don't say lightly, as I am well aware I'm talking about a restaurant in Champaign, Illinois. Yet, we have such a restaurant and it's a shame we don't trumpet it more.The pros:The service. The staff is exceptionally well-trained, smooth, and (almost) flawless.The dishes. Creative, never boring, always executed well. And also always worth it. The attitude. Everyone at Bacaro takes operating a restaurant seriously. Bacaro is professional to the core, and proud of it. So, seats aren't ripped, napkins aren't fraying at the edges (even slightly), dirt hasn't built up in corners, the decor isn't allowed to grow stale, the food never leaves the kitchen unless it's up to very high standard.The Chef buys locally - and has for a long time.The decor. Modern, it's visually interesting without feeling \"cold.\" Love the bathrooms and the cloth towels.Location. Downtown Champaign is always fun.Their tasting menus. Spring for it and try one. They can be food revelations.The cons:A lot of people in C-U are unnerved by Bacaro. I've had friends and co-workers describe it as \"too fancy,\" \"too elite,\" \"too cool\" for them (I disagree, but what can you do with someone's insecurities?) That dismissal shows up in other reviews here, too. The dishes. Sometimes all that creativity is just too much. Even though they're really, really good, it's sometimes hard to get geared up for appetizers like \"fried watermelon\" and \"popcorn with truffle oil.\"",

        "review": "Xinh Xinh Cafe is known as *the* place for pho in Champaign-Urbana, and that reputation is well deserved. We've visited several times over the last two years and had almost every menu item. Every pho we've tried is absolutely excellent. Indeed, it is still good after travel time if you choose carry-out. \u00a0But I recommend eating in. \u00a0The decor is modern, as others note. It is pleasant, with lots of stainless/aluminum. But is is not oppressive or alienating in any way. It is simple fare in a restaurant with a relatively simple decor. (Perhaps exotic to Americans, but pho is really a simple dish in Vietnam.) \u00a0They serve dishes other than pho. Our favorite are the bahn mi sandwiches. Serving sizes of the pho are large, sometimes more than we can eat depending upon how hungry we are. The bahn mi sandwiches, however, are small. When I was in Vietnam we became accustomed to them using a half baguette. These are about six inches long. BUT... bit but... flavor is the best I've had in many years. Every visit the service has been exceptional. They are attentive and take your order very quickly, and they keep your drinks, even water, filled all the time. They are quick to bring extra or different kinds of hot sauces, soy sauce, oyster sauce, etc. if you ask. They lack a web page, but do have a small \u00a0and not greatly informative facebook page. To me, that is not a substitute for a real web page, preferably one with a menu. \u00a0When you approach you feel a bit cheap going to a strip mall restaurant. But the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff quickly make up for that.",

I'd say take out if you can, it's cramped and air is blasting brr!Pho is aight, it used to be better a few years back but if you're not picky with pho then go for it.

        "review": "I had the worst of luck with Vietnamese food this past weekend, but I decided to give it another go since there was hardly anything opened on Memorial Day. I ordered the bun thit nuong cha gio and Kenny ordered bun nem nuong cha gio. We also ordered a watermelon bubble tea drink. The flavor of the bun dishes were on point, but I was slightly put off by the cube-shaped meat in my bun thit nuong. What the heck was that all about? I've never had it prepared that way, so in the end, I traded dishes with Kenny. The nem nuong flavor was on point as well, but the meat was cut way too thin that you could hardly taste the flavor at all. The cha gio were delicious, but I wish they were a bit more fried... The egg roll skin disintegrated too quickly during the meal, and that's not appealing at all. Then the worst offender of all: the watermelon bubble tea. We wanted real watermelon, damnit. It was a hot day and we wanted something refreshing. This watermelon-flavored tea drink with boba in it was disgusting as all hell. We couldn't take another sip after one or two. It was that bad. Kenny and I actually thought that we had ordered the watermelon slushie, so when we looked at the menu again, we found out that the slushie wouldn't have been that much better-- it would have been the same exact thing in icy form AND it was more expensive. What the hell? Eww, gross. Luckily, we came during their happy hour and so the price of our meal didn't cost as much as we thought it was going to cost us. Still, I was disappointed to have yet again wasted money on sub-par Vietnamese food.",

I do wish they would put more meat into their stock given the big price and the big noodle bowl, but I'd take the authentic flavor over quantity. Toppings are usually lacking as well. They give one lime wedge, a few sprigs of basil and a good tablespoon full of bean sprouts. That's it.Outside of quantity, the flavor is decent and worth going out to eat for.",

        "review": "Growing up fairly close to one of Brooklyn's Chinatowns I had easy access to authentic Vietnamese food whenever I wanted. I came into Xinh Xinh not knowing what to expect- how good would Vietnamese be in Central IL?Turns out, it's great! I had the dac biet (Go with this pho- you get beef slices along with all the other fun cow parts like tripe and tendon) and my girlfriend had a banh mi. My pho had flavorful broth (watery pho broth is the worst) and the garnishes were fresh and a good portion. I was really impressed at the quality of my girlfriend's banh mi's bread. Banh Mi is all about the bread- when you've had a good banh mi you know what I mean. We also shared an avocado shake, which we both really liked.My only real gripe, surprisingly enough, was the price. I guess it's hard for Xinh Xinh to get some of the ingredients they use down in Urbana but believe it or not I think the pho in NYC might actually be cheaper and a larger portion (eg, the dac biet here costs about \u00a0as much as xe lua in NYC [xe lua is like a giant portion of dac biet]). Nonetheless, I'll happily come back! Plus my price issues are really mitigated by the fact that they take 5% off if you pay in cash and they have pho happy hour on Wednesday.",

He really takes pride in his work and you can tell because when he asks how everything was, he's really asking how everything was.2: Get the freaking Banh Mi. Get the banh mi. Get it. Now. I'm going to assume from the domination of pho reviews that a lot of people in CU haven't been converted yet to this most awesome ambrosia of Asia. It's basically a Vietnamese hoagie (I cringe too as I type that): the bastard child of the French occupation of Vietnam that grows up to be a beautiful, exotic Helen of Troy. A banh mi baguette is made with rice flour which gives a fragrant papery aroma (versus the yeasty aroma of French baguettes), a delicate crackly crust and a softly chewy interior. It's filled with any combination of ingredients that reflect the Vietnamese talent for marrying flavors (who else can make something taste hot, cool, spicy, succulent, crunchy and meaty at the same time?).Xinh Xinh's banh mi is effing great! It's not the behemoth banh mi of SF (which are the size of a Fat Sandwich sandwich) but it's the perfect size for a meal. I'll confess that when I go in, I order five sandwiches. Because this place brings out the glutton in me.Shai changes up the menu as well so there are daily specials and new sandwiches to put into my five-sandwich rotation.For starters, I'd go with the B1 (classic), the beef with papaya salad (different), the chicken (comforting) or... well, you see how this gets out of hand.Moving on before I drool more and short out my keyboard.3.) The appetizers are also awesome. Hands down the BEST spring rolls in town. Yes, beating out any of the Thai restaurants. I'm partial to the pork one that has some kind of wonderful crunchy stick. I also tend to add both kinds of spring rolls on top of those five sandwiches.4.) There is some really cool and unusual stuff on the menu for adventurous foodies. There's nothing more thrilling than finding someone in CU who know's what's up and would rather go balls-to-the-wall than play it safe. I'm talking about the egg soda. Not an egg creme soda. An egg soda. Bubble tea is all well and good but... EGG SODA!!This is the only restaurant that I will trek to Urbana to. On the days when I roll out of bed too late to make it there (they are open til ten pm Mon - Sat), I go hungry because I know anything else will be a disappointment. I love this place.

        "review": "When writing these reviews, I know that people can't help but compare our local Vietnamese restaurant to other Vietnamese restaurants in L.A., San Francisco, or another urban area with a greater concentration of ethnic cuisine. \u00a0Maybe Xinh Xinh doesn't live up to a well-traveled foodie's expectations in terms of \"authenticity\" or flavor or the size of their pho bowls, but the same criticism could be made about any restaurant in this town (i.e., our best restaurant can't compete with New York's best)...and quite frankly, I doubt many people could shell out $300+ and fly to L.A. just to try your favorite Vietnamese restaurant out there. \u00a0Ok, rant over.So in terms of restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area, how does Xinh Xinh stack up? \u00a0The menu might appear limited, given that most of the items are just variations of banh mi (sandwiches), pho (noodle soup), bun (cold noodle \"salad\"), and rice plates (usually accompanied by some kind of grilled meat). \u00a0However, there are usually 7 or more combinations of each dish, served with different meats, sauces, etc., so the menu is pretty extensive if you plan to sample it all. \u00a0While the restaurant didn't start with many vegetarian options, they've been consistently adding more over time, and the servers are usually helpful in pointing out vegetarian dishes on the menu. \u00a0You should also speak to the owner (Shai), who can tell you about upcoming dates when he plans to have vegetarian daily specials.For appetizers, I really recommend the glazed chicken wings or nantaing (spicy ground pork dipping sauce served with baguette slices and shrimp chips). \u00a0The chicken wings smell a little funky, but you'll overlook that once you get a taste of them. \u00a0I love the flavor of the nantaing, and I especially love the sound of crackling shrimp chips when they touch the sauce. \u00a0I usually order the pate ban mih, though many people complain about the strange \"metallic\" flavor that is often attributed to pate. \u00a0If you're feeling a little less adventurous, I'd recommend the grilled pork ban mih. \u00a0I am also really impressed with the bun (noodle \"salad\") that they serve. \u00a0Xinh Xinh's bun has generous portions of meat, bean sprouts, carrots, and lettuce (yum!), along with the usual rice noodles and spring roll.My only complaint is that the restaurant is pretty small, so it usually can't accommodate large parties unless you're one of the only patrons there. \u00a0With limited seating, Xinh Xinh also fills up rapidly on busy nights, especially for their Wednesday night pho happy hour. \u00a0I would suggest avoiding peak hours or getting your food to-go if you are impatient about waiting for a table.If you add Xinh Xinh as a friend on Facebook, you can get updates on their daily/weekly specials. \u00a0This is really helpful for vegetarians as some of the veg-friendly options (e.g., pho chay) are only offered on certain days.",

I don't often eat fried food, but these wings have a delicate crunch and they are covered with this great sauce. There's honey, of course, and hot pepper flakes, and possibly ginger...my friend and I are dying to try and replicate this taste.I went today and, since I had gotten my refund check, decided to splurge. I had the lime soda, which was delicious and refreshing and homemade, not too sweet. We split the aforementioned wings, which are moist and delicious, and spring rolls, which were crunchy and fresh and held together well.My friend and I also got banh mi, which I have never had before. I got mine with garlic beef and was rewarded with soft crunchy bread, a subtle bite of pickled veggies, and tender savory bits of beef. I thought it was really tasty! There was a lot of bread, though, and I'm not sure it was much different from a normal baguette I could buy. I understand that banh mi is supposed to be on bread with rice and wheat flour, so I expected it to be a little lighter. Everything was really good though. In fact, I know that in the warmer months they offer vermicelli bowls, and I can't wait to try that. I also want to come for $5 pho on Wednesday. Yum.One weird thing: I'd love it if we got some plates with our appetizers. I always end up making a mess!",

        "review": "Good stuff. We went around 7pm Friday night; a 3-5 minute wait for a table. We ordered pho, a banh mi with pork roll and pate, spring rolls, a lime soda, and a vanilla boba tea.The pho was the lighter style; less salty, but also less rich. (I compare it to the Southern style you find in San Francisco.) The tripe was fresh and bouncy, the tendon a little soft, and the beef a little less flavorful than I like, but the noodles were excellent. The broth could be due to the fact we went late. (If they run out of broth during the day, they have to make more, and it can be a little thin.)The banh mi was great - the baguette was very fresh and light. Excellent balance of meat and carrot. The Mrs. thought the meat was too meaty, but this often happens - I tend to prefer my meat a little... gamier. I'm not the biggest fan of daikon, but this worked out. I would ask to hold the cilantro next time, but that's me, not them.The spring rolls - excellent. They include a small strip of what seems like either deep fried tofu skin or rice paper, and a strip of some kind of pork (it reminded me of the kind of maling meat-food-product that you get in spam musubi, but fried). Truly excellent balance of flavors.On a sad note, we never got our drinks (and on top of that, when we went to pay, they explained were out of boba (!), but the service was otherwise full of smiles, polite, reasonably fast (although not fast enough for a working lunch), while leaving us in peace to eat.The owner was ringing us up immediately recognized that we didn't get our drinks and apologized, explaining that they're still working out the kinks. I have no problem with that. They seem understaffed; it's always difficult running a new restaurant and the little extra effort makes me forgive forgetting the drinks.Verdict: Would pay about 2x as much.",

They also have some great appetizers, especially their Nataing.I'm not entirely sure why some people here don't like their prices. They have $5 Pho dinner specials on certain days which is a phenomenal deal (I'm not sure you could buy their quality ingredients at that price at most grocery stores), and their normal prices are less than $10 for a huge portion.

        "review": "My wife and I were among the first guests at this amazing store-front restaurant. If I recall correctly, we were there on the first night they were open. Since, we've been back a few times, always loving it. Unfortunately, most (all?) of our favorites depend in great measure on carbs, and my wife prefers to avoid the temptation. (When she reads this, I will be in such trouble!)Tonight, being the last night before my wife comes back from visiting family, etc., I went over and had a few of *my* favorites, kinda pigging out a bit.I had the Fried Spring Rolls appetizer, some of the best Vietnamese fried spring rolls I've ever had. They are served with lettuce leaves, cucumber strips, and cilantro sprigs. The intention is that you wrap a Spring Roll, some cilantro, and a cucumber strip in a leaf of lettuce, then dip that package into the lime fish sauce and enjoy. You get a lovely combination of fried, crispy, oily, hot, cool, and fresh.I also had the Nataing appetizer. This is a small bowl (I want a big bowl!) of meaty, spicy, oily, sweet yumminess, served with prawn chips for dipping, and a few pieces of good French bread. (When they first opened, they used a different prawn chip. I enjoyed them because they were different than I'd had anywhere else. The current chips probably are a bit better, though.) The French bread works really well for soaking up the sauce and becoming bites of pleasure.I finished with a Charbroiled Beef Skewer sandwich. Very flavorful beef with a spicy papaya and carrot salad and cilantro sprigs. I wound up removing the top of the (good French bread) loaf (which I took home to have for breakfast tomorrow) because I was running low on capacity. I had a couple cilantro sprigs left from the Spring rolls, which I added to the sandwich. This made a great sandwich. I think with the top bread in place, the bread to filling ratio is higher than I prefer (partly because the meat is so very good).As I was paying, I noticed a white board with a variety of vermicelli noodle bowl dishes. At other Vietnamese restaurants, these are among my favorites, and I will have to come back here soon to try their version.Almost forgot to talk about service. Very friendly and attentive, but between the kitchen and servers, they do not understand the concept of pacing. I got both appetizers and sandwich quickly, but within a span of about 3 minutes. I suggest that if you care about such things, you order the appetizer(s). Then, when you are nearly finished with them, order the main course(s).",

I didn't mind that it was a small restaurant. I'm used to that from dining in San Diego. Our server was very nice, patient with us, and made sure our water glasses were filled. Now for the bad part. I did not like the food. Three of us ordered the bun (bun nem noung, bun thit cha gio, bun cha gio) and our fourth ordered the banh mi dac biet. The meat in the bun was extremely dried out, hard, overcooked, and tasteless. I thought that nem noung was suppose to be meatballs on skewers that were grilled or patties that were grilled. Instead we were served chopped up pieces of dried out pork. The grilled chicken bun was the same way. The food portions were fine. I would've preferred much more lettuce, bean sprouts, and herbs. I also would've liked peanuts and fried shallots on top of the bun. \u00a0I also didn't like the the sauce that came with it. It was lacking in flavor. It was neither salty, sweet, nor spicy. The banh mi was average. The pickled daikon and carrots and the cha lua were the best things about it. The pate was horrible. The bread was not the typical banh mi baguette. I've never seen a banh mi baguette that had corn meal on the bottom of it, thus I assumed it was regular American-made bread. It was too dense and hard. The egg rolls in the bun tasted okay. Our food was presented nicely. But the food tasted only so-so to almost bad. I almost wished one of us had tried the pho just so I could get a better idea of the food.I understand my review is somewhat harsh.

We have had lunch here several times in the past year, usually to satisfy my craving for pho, which I have enjoyed immensely in Vietnamese restaurants in Chicago and Dallas-Ft.Worth. The last time I came here, I had fried spring rolls and pho with thin sliced beef. The noodles were great, meat was just right, and the bean sprouts and herbs were fresh (but could be fresher). I also had Vietnamese iced coffee (ca phe sua da, condensed milk with black coffee that slowly drips down into the cup as it sits on your table) that was as authentic as any Vietnamese coffee I have ever tasted. Service here has been great, as well. My main gripe with Xinh Xinh cafe is that their portions are incredibly tiny. When I spend $15 for a meal, including tip, I expect to leave satisfied, but the serving size just doesn't cut it for me.

The pho is the best in C-U in my opinion 'cuz it tastes the way authentic pho should. The broth is very flavorful and tastes like time and care was put into it's preparation. The veggies that come with the pho looked nice and fresh. The plum soda tastes just like it does back home...salty and sweet just the way I like it. It's definitely an acquired taste though. The almond boba I tried was also delish and refreshing. The rice paper wrapped spring rolls (the fried version) were very tasty and I loved being able to wrap them in the lettuce and mint leaves. The rolls looked skinny but they were actually quite filling...you get 4. I also tried the fresh spring rolls (not fried) and those were huge! The fried wontons inside were a delightful surprise and the whole thing tasted so good! The meat is definitely flavored well. You get 2 in an order but one was already filling for me. I would definitely still try to eat both by myself though! And the sandwiches...also the best in C-U (although I think Xinh Xinh is the only place that actually has banh mi sandwiches). There's a variety to choose from but I tried the grilled pork sandwich. The size was just right. It had plenty of the delicious traditional fillings like pickled radish and carrots, jalapenos, cilantro, etc. The pork was super tasty and there was plenty of it. The prices were reasonable for this area -- about $2 for the drinks, $4 for appetizers and sandwiches, and $7 for the pho (all prices approximate). I also just noticed that Xinh Xinh has weekly specials for things not on the menu, like rice dishes. I'll have to try that next time. There's actually a lot of other things I want to try. Service is still pretty fast even though I only saw one waiter. For takeout, I would call ahead.

I'm sorry to say, that I wasn't at all impressed with the pho they had at this restaurant. \u00a0It tasted bland. \u00a0You know pho is awesome when you don't have to add any siracha or hoisin sauce to it. \u00a0I definitely loaded my pho with siracha and hoisin. \u00a0But even then, it wasn't so appetizing.Other than this, I thought ALL of the spring rolls here were awesome! You must try the fried spring rools wrapped up in lettuce appetizers. \u00a0Also, one of my friends had an awesome rice place...not sure which one it was, but it was pretty yummy! I recommend ordering \u00a0a rice plate or vermicelli plate, instead of getting any of the pho.Lastly, I was surprised with there fried banana dessert! I normally have vanilla or coconut ice cream with fried banana, but instead, they drizzled this AMAZING chocolate sauce over it....AMAZING! YOU MUST TRY IT! :)",

Both the hubster and I are quite fond of Vietnamese food and seek it our wherever we are, so we ate here twice during our 3 day stay. First, I really like the space, which, with its' corrugated metal walls and local art work, manages to be both urban and cozy at the same time. The guy at the counter waits tables, so he sat us, brought us water and served our food, all while taking care of other customers and running the counter very efficiently and with a smile. I had eaten a large lunch, so had the tofu summer rolls, which were great...very fresh veggies and marinated tofu, with a crunchy fried component in the center that added textural interest, served with a tasty hoisin-peanut sauce. When I looked around I noticed many other folks had ordered those tofu summer rolls, so they're very popular. I also ordered the chicken dumplings, which were excellent...tasty little fried morsels served with a sweet fish sauce dipping sauce. Doug had the bun (vermicelli rice noodle bowl) with chicken and an extra fried spring roll and said it was great...noodles a little thicker than the average that looked homemade and well marinated chicken, served with a sauce that he thought too sweet initially, but then warmed up to. Xinh Xinh has a wide range of beverages choices, from bubble teas to Vietnamese sodas, hot tea, an avocado shake, Thai iced tea, coconut juice, and that most delicious of beverages, Vietnamese drip coffee sweetened with condensed milk...rich and sweet yumminess. We had the banh mi on our second visit, which is the traditional Vietnamese baguette sandwich. We tried the roast pork pate combo and the pepper chicken, and they were both good, but not stellar. I admit to being a little spoiled by the banh mi at Dong Phuong in New Orleans, which have ruined the experience for me anywhere else. We didn't try the pho, as we don't eat beef and they don't offer the chicken variety, although they do have a vegetarian pho on the menu. I like the thought they put into everything here, from the fresh ingredients to the cute decor. They even have their own little hand drawn character...the Pho King Man...keep in mind that \"pho\" is pronounced \"fu\" and then say it out loud. You'll get it.",

But that wasn't the real issue...the biggest issue came from...2) Pho: Out of all the authentic Vietnamese restaurants we have been to (several at Argyle in Chicago and other places outside of Chicago-NY, VA), this place was by far the worst. First, the soup was too bland that we had to put in a lot of sriracha and hoison sauce -- normally, at other places we've been to, the soup would not need any seasoning because of the already flavorful beef broth (in other words, it was optional to put in the sauce but in this case, even with the additional sauce, the soup was still bad). Noodles were not fully cooked and after a few bites, we gave up. 3) Price: For some odd reason, they charge fairly high for their dishes. You can have far better tasting pho at other places in Chicago for much cheaper price!All in all, we were very disappointed. Ever since the viet place on Savoy closed, we have been wanting to try other Viet places in Champaign/Urbana. The positive reviews here may have been for other dishes but it is still hard for me to believe that this place received four stars out of five.

        "review": "First - if you needed another reason to enjoy cupcakes - Cakes on Walnut makes an effort to be green about their indulgences; they encourage patrons to bring in their own containers for take-away cupcakes and offer a discount to those who do. Now, the cupcake selection itself was a touch limited. This past Saturday there was only one (\"confetti\" - their take on the Pillsbury classic \"funfetti\") that wasn't chocolate or pumpkin. One white-cake crowded by chocolate, chocolate lavender, black and white, and red velvet (chocolate cake died red). Um, variety is the spice of life? At least they offer variety in the size of the cupcakes (mini to large). But the coffee!! Three cheers for French Press Coffee! You get to take the whole little tureen back to your table to enjoy at your leisure (one french press contains about 4 cups of coffee). As true coffee connoisseurs will agree, the tastiest coffee comes from french presses. Overall, the place is adorable and clearly beloved as it was nonstop busy throughout our stay. I will definitely be back on my next trip to downtown Champaign.",

But that concern quickly evaporated after my first visit, and now Cakes is a must-stop for me, as I am expected to walk through the door in the city in which I reside with a box of the latest cupcakes from Champaign. Cakes delivers on its name by offering eight varieties of cupcakes each day, ranging from the staple (vanilla; red velvet) to the exciting (smore; limoncello). \u00a0Contrary to what a couple of other reviewers have said, these cakes do _not_ taste like a mix, but taste and are homemade - you can watch the process go down in the open kitchen area, if you like. \u00a0The frosting is delectable, although you will have a hard time avoiding wiping a fair amount of it on your nose as you attempt to eat it.The ambiance is nice and charming, hand-painted with a swallow motif on the wall and cute, modern interior. \u00a0The bar is a nice touch and great place to enjoy a cupcake with a glass of milk or French press coffee. \u00a0The staff are friendly and warm and don't mind if you nurse your single cupcake for awhile, or grab them to go.Cakes on Walnut is one of the few truly special food destinations in C-U and one of the few whose reputation crosses the city limits. \u00a0I am a fan.",

There were 4-5 cupcake flavors to choose from plus a brownie and maybe three different types of cookies. The setup of the shop is a little weird in that the cupcakes are displayed on the side, so if this place ever got busy and a line formed it would be a little chaotic to see which cupcakes were available and then actually get in line in front of the register. The menu was posted on the wall adjacent to the display case, but I didn't even notice it until I had my cupcake and was sitting down.But those are minor issues. I ordered a vanilla cupcake and took a seat. The cake itself was dry and the cupcake was way overpriced at $2.99 for being so small. The saving grace of my purchase was the icing. It was delicious! The sugar sprinkles on top were a great touch. I'd come here again for a cupcake, but I find the high pricetag really annoying and a major put-off.Cream & Flutter has cocktails in addition to milk, coffee, and tea. This makes me wonder if they are trying to position themselves as a place to hang out instead of a place to go just to wolf down a treat. If the former then the interior needs work. It's a bit stark and the chairs aren't the most comfortable to just sit and relax. A cozier atmosphere would be more conducive to sipping a cocktail and staying there longer.

The red velvet was also kinda \"meh\" - the cake was too dense and the frosting was too sugary. Regardless, I will come back to try some more flavors, they have a good thing going here ...",

It used to be called \"Cupcakes on Walnut\" or something like that, from my not-so-good recollection.At any rate, I always enjoyed the scenery of the place and how cheerful the place seemed to be. The servers were usually attentive and nice. Only on occasion did I ever feel they weren't welcoming. I loved the novelty cupcakes from \"pink lemonade\" to \"s'mores\" - the presentation was always nice and artfully done.It can get rather over crowded, leaving you no room to sit and savor your food. The beverages and other food items were overpriced for the quality put forth. So I don't recommend consuming those. Some cupcakes weren't worth all it was cracked up to be, but for the most part, I give this place two cupcakes up.",

Our cupcake (salted caramel) was quite good. It could have been a bit more moist, and others have noted this (let's hope the \"Cakes\" staff is reading these).The decor is nice, and the \"open kitchen\" concept works well.With some slight adjustments to their recipe, they could really be a hit. \u00a0The place does have a spartan look right now, but as with everything else I give them the benefit of the doubt and expect they'll make changes or not make it. They've barely been open a week!As for the price, given that this is what they make and virtually all they sell, I think to come in, sit at the counter, eat a cupcake with a glass of water and chat for 15 minutes with a server, $3.25 is hardly enough for them to stay in business. Cupcake vs. latte at $3.25? Cupcake wins. My feeling is that they should perfect the cupcake and keep the price.We'll revisit our review after our next visit in a few weeks.",

The decor is really visually interesting, with high ceilings, spacious seating and cupcake bar seating as well, but plenty of room to move around. What is brilliant about this little place is the gimmick: great cupcakes and alcohol. They have a different assortment of cupcakes everyday, and I have yet to try anything I didn't love but also did not surprise me. The Red Velvets are one of their classics, but the Coconut and Pistachio are spontaneous and amazing. Ideally, you should always try anything seasonally-related. A great perk to the cupcakes is the serving sizes; they have a regular and a petite size of each flavor. This allows you to either try multiple flavors if you cannot decide but have a threshold for sugar, as well adjust according to your appetite. They have a wide selection of wines (red and white), bottled beer and coffee-type drinks to go with the cupcakes depending on what kind of evening you are having.Located on a street filled with nice restaurants and bars, this is a great place to go at nights' end, or if you just need an afternoon pick-me-up. I highly recommend Cakes on Walnut.NOTE: Every year this bakery releases a fund-raising calendar in collaboration with other local merchants for a few dollars. The girls who work there pose with the baked goods and are dressed by local retailers. Also, like many of the cafes in the area, they sponsor local artists by hanging art on their walls for sale. Both are really good ways to support the local professional arts community in Champaign.",

There were two different sizes of cupcakes, and the flavors were always changing and improving. The girls who ran the shop were friendly and helpful, and I just loved going in to see what was new.Unfortunately, over the last year or two this place has started to slip. They changed their name to Cream & Flutter, and it seems the name change has brought them nothing but bad luck. They did away with their larger cupcakes, leaving only standard size. That wouldn't be so bad, but these standard sized cupcakes are now being sold for what the larger ones used to run (over $3 with tax). Along with the increased price for less product, as some others have mentioned, the products aren't fresh! This store stays open until 9 PM, but doesn't make products to accommodate that time frame. They are either out of cupcakes or the cupcakes are stale. Eventually I stopped going after 3 PM.It seems that this shop has started focusing on being \"cool\" and emulating cupcakers on Food Network more than on quality product. Sure, they sell lots of cutesy candies and nice looking cupcakes, but everything is overpriced and I could easily make the same thing at home. If you've got a Pinterest, you can make comparable cupcakes. The only reason I go in anymore is for their absolutely amazing brownies, but sadly those are also starting to decrease in size and increase in price.I've always loved this shop, but they need to revert back to some of their older ways to keep some of their old customers!

And gave kind of a 'duh' look... Rude to say the least. Not even apologetic that they were completely out of their namesake treat.Final visit. Went in around the same time as our second attempt and.. Victory! They had cupcakes!.. We ordered two. One was the spicy chocolate cupcake with butter-cream frosting and toasted marshmellow. \u00a0It was gross. DRY. Frosting tasted like pure butter.. spicy chocolate was a decent concept, but poorly executed. The second cupcake we had was phenomenal. Best cupcake I've ever had. It was the smore cupcake, very moist chocolate cake, ooy gooooy marshmellow cream filling, marshmellow frosting and toasted marshmellows on top!! PHENOMENAL!! .. Soo.. Based on this visit alone I would give them 3 stars just because the last cupcake was so freaking amazing..but considering their rude staff, poor service, and the hit or miss treats..

        "review": "This was my first experience with Indian food and I wasn't too impressed. Sitara has the best reviews on Yelp and I even ordered a lot of food to try and get a variety of different things.I had the mixed grill which is Malai, Tikka, Garlic and Tandoori Chicken, and also comes with a lamb seekh kabob. I also got the Paneer Pakoras and the yellow Dol and rice which came with the meal.Almost all of the chicken were in boneless chunks, with the exception of 2 wings, which I believe were the Tandoori. They were all pretty dry and almost similar to each other. Maybe this is because they are grilled rather than fried? Maybe I'm just used to heavily breaded chicken? I'm not sure. I did like the flavor of the Tikka(?) though, it was a little sweet and spicy. The lamb kabab was a little more flavorful and better in consistency but still wasn't as good as I'd hoped. Now, the rice that came with my entr\u00e9e was surprisingly good for being just basmati rice. I was also given what felt like at least a pound of it, so no shortage there. The yellow Dol is not something I ever had before, but that I did like. It had a really interesting herbal flavor to it and can most closely be described as a soup.I also got an appetizer of Paneer Pakoras which I'd say are similar to a mozzarella stick but not as greasy and heavy. These were good but by the time I had gotten around to eating them were inevitably cold. They were unusually tasty and came with 2 dipping sauces. One was a VERY spicy green sauce and I'm not sure about the other one, possibly a sweet berry sauce. Either way these sauces were delicious and I ended up dipping my chicken in them.Overall the portion to price ratio was pretty good, although I wasn't very happy about how expensive my meal was considering I didn't much care for the chicken which was most of my dinner.Delivery speed was really quick probably about 30 minutes but I actually think the delivery was the reason I didn't enjoy my food. Often times with delivery things sit around and get overcooked in the process. I think if I am ever to try Sitara, or any Indian food again, I will definitely go into the actual restaurant. From the pictures I've looked at, most Indian food looks very moist and saucy which is what I was hoping mine would be, but it was kind of dry.",

I have tried all but 1 other of the Indian restaurants in the CU area and this is at the top of the list so far.1 star deducted for 2 reasons:1. Service was subpar. The glass of water I got was lukewarm. Had maybe 1 sip of water left in the glass and the server looked at my table, walked by a few times without refilling, went back behind the bar and was on his phone. About the 4th time he finally came back and finally refilled the water....with more lukewarm water.2. The vindaloo had broccoli in it. I've had vindaloo plenty of times and have had different places add a variety of veggies, but never crunchy broccoli. It was kind of random and kind of seemed like it was a random vegetable added to the dish to stay true to the menu that said \"a curry with assorted veggies\". Honestly it took away from the dish. I would most probably come back here and try another dish and hope that service is a little better.",

The problem was the service. I'm normally not picky about service, as long as I get what I ordered I'm happy. But decide for yourself whether the following is acceptable to you. They're supposed to open at 4:30, and we arrived at 4:35 to find the door closed and locked. My wife and I then walked around the block for a few minutes to wait, came back, and the place still wasn't open. I peered through the window to check if anyone was inside, and made eye contact with two of the restaurant staff. They stared at me, then went back to chatting with each other (they weren't even busy preparing tables or anything). By this time it was around 4:45.Once inside, we basically got the cold shoulder treatment, as if they were being passive-aggressive about my peering inside earlier. No smiles, no welcoming attitude, and when they came to take our order they just stood next to us without saying or asking anything. We ordered a lot so we had plenty left over, and specifically asked for TWO boxes to go, and they only brought one of the small boxes, which was clearly inadequate for how much we had left. So in summary, 4/5 for the food, 1/5 for the service, 3/5 overall.",

There is no street parking, but there is ample parking in the structure immediately behind Sitara (and parking in the structure currently is free on weekends and on weekday evenings). Inside it is clearly a former bar. Lots of wood, a beautiful bar; a few booths and small tables line the South side of Sitara. Service was excellent. We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and seated immediately. The lunch menu is extensive, with sections for appetizers, vegetable dishes, lamb dishes, fish dishes, chicken dishes, bread dishes, and rice dishes (each with as few as 10 or as many as 20 listings). When we visited the prices began at 7.99, with most at 9.99. Meals include either naan or rice and an entree. We tried a lamb and a fish dish, and we both liked both of them. We also had an appetizer of vegetables prepared tempura-like with delicious sauces.Our water and drink glasses were never less than half full and both our waiter and other employees checked on us several times during the meal, making sure the food was good, hot, spiced properly, etc. There were several tables with children, but there doesn't appear to be a children's menu. (They may have one, but we didn't see it.) The tables are small and close together, so it may be difficult for a person in a wheelchair or walker. The naan was freshly made when we ordered it, and it was delicious. Just a slight puff, but still dense; you could taste the char-grill on it, just right, as should be the case. The lamb was tender and plentiful in the sauce. The fish was excellent too, though to my taste the sauce overwhelmed the fish flavor a little too much. Tasty, but I prefered the lamb because the balance of meat and sauce flavors let the best of both come through.There were several flat screen televisions playing Indian music videos. They were not unpleasant-- not too loud and one could easily talk and be heard. All in all I like Sitara a lot and recommend it highly. Everything is freshly made and delicious.

Damned. French. Toast. In. The. World.How is it so good? \u00a0That's a good question. \u00a0Somehow the combination of totally ordinary white bread and totally ordinary pancake batter transcends the potential of both parts to result in something truly drool-worthy: a giant slab of golden brown toast in a pool of butter and syrup. \u00a0If you like French toast, there's no reason to consider anything else on the menu.BUT if you do, you'll find that they also have grits - a rarity above the Mason-Dixon line - swimming in butter, crispy bacon, truly over-medium eggs, and delicious pancakes. \u00a0The coffee is, well, blackish, but it's really not fair to judge a diner on the quality of their coffee. \u00a0Your mug will always be full, for better or for worse.My husband and I moved away from Champaign in 2007 but make a point of having breakfast at Sam's whenever we're back. \u00a0There are better-for-us breakfasts in Champaign. \u00a0There are fancier breakfasts in Champaign. \u00a0But there's only one Sam's, and we'll keep coming back as long as it sticks around.",

They had four items on their dinner menu, each being either $7 or $7.50, including tax:1. Shish Taok. Small chicken breast pieces, fried in a garlic sauce. recommended. 2. Kibbe. I don't recommend it. A mixture of some sort and then fried, tasted strange.3. Kafta. Their main beef meal. By far the best food they had. Very tasty.4. Falafel. It was ok. nothing to brag about. They had a special meal that night, for $12, which had fried rice and cooked chicken. It was ok.Each meal comes with a choice of two meals. We all got homous, and tabolli, both of them being delicious. In fact, I think the homous was their best food!

Of course, I opted for the platter to get a taste of everything.- Corned beef and cabbage was nice spotted in the Irish stew. Mmm...- Rare bit - basically cheese on toast, was horrid. Soggy bread with fake, melted cheese on it. - Irish soda bread - classic!- Irish stew - infused with lamb, potatoes, and veggies.

This place features all kinds of local beers from the IL area in addition to featuring a ton of other great microbrews from across the country. I wouldn't come here in a rush because you need some time to actually read through all of their beer selections there are that many! It is a mini binder, so come ready to read about beer, taste beer, and enjoy beer, and then maybe even play a little pool (until the pool league comes in that is, since they have a league here a few days a week!). They also have beer samplers and I have to say that Matt J. and I were very impressed with our bar tender in that she not only remembered the 10 different beers we ordered, but then recited them back in order in increasing light to dark beers as well. Amazing. That is the type of bar tender at a great beer place that you want. So hat's off to her! The food looked pretty good here too and everyone here just seemed happy in general. It is a darker bar restaurant on the inside so good for group outings or dates I would say, but if you don't like beer, you will be missing the main draw of this place!",

It's equal parts restaurant and bar; you can get a drink or a meal whether you're at a table or the bar. There are also a couple of pool tables across from the bar, and when it's warm out you can sit at a table in the eponymous alley next to the bar. (Do this at night--it can feel downright romantic beneath the strings of little lightbulbs.)Crane Alley has an excellent beer selection. They always have a dozen or so good ones on tap, and the bartenders and servers are knowledgeable enough to give recommendations. (I think they do beer tastings and whiskey tastings, although I've never been.) The liquor selection is good, with an emphasis on whiskey, and there are a couple of menu pages dedicated to sweet cocktails. I usually ordered beer here but the few mixed drinks I had were well-made.Food-wise, they serve burgers, pasta, steaks, and appetizers. I was an especially big fan of the Portobello mushroom sandwich (a burger-type sandwich with a mushroom instead of meat, and roasted red pepper, feta, and pesto) and the potato pancakes (a decently-sized appetizer that comes with asparagus and a tasty cream sauce). My only complaint about this place is that some of the meals feel overpriced--my friend ordered the hanger steak once and it was not $16 worth of steak. Oh, and I wish they had kept the beet chips on the menu; paired with a goat cream cheese for dipping, they were awesome, but they disappeared from the menu sometime last year.Downtown Urbana actually has a handful of restaurants and bars, but for whatever reason most of them feel like exclusively townie haunts. Crane Alley and Black Dog are the two exceptions, and unless you're specifically in the mood for barbecue and are willing to wait an hour for a table at Black Dog, Crane Alley is the place to go. It's too far from campus for the undergrads, so it's usually a mix of grad students and professionals. You can eat a burger at the bar, you can grab a beer and play pool, or you can treat your date to fancy cocktails and a nice dinner in the upstairs loft. Highly recommended.",

I got the 15$ burger thinking, well it's the most expensive one, should be pretty tasty right? WRONG. I substituted the fries for the soup of the day which was jambalaya. +2.50$. Blah. The jambalaya was actually pretty decent. Not amazing but it was pretty hardy. The burger came out and it just seemed like crane alley was trying to do too much on one burger. It had blue cheese, Dijon mustard, bacon and a few other things that didn't go together great. I've also forgot the name of the burger. It was the only one over 14$I almost gave this place 2 stars but I felt kinda bad because it seems like they have a good beer selection and the staff is very polite. Would I go back? Probably not.

If you are the type that likes to occasionally order an appetizer for your entree, think again: many apps are really skimpy. Also, food service can be very slow at times, as I think they stretch their servers too thin. They also have very few vegetarian options, which surprises me, based upon their clientele.Notice how all these comments are about food? That is because their alcohol service, selection, and quality are all beyond reproach. Their prices, including their alcohol prices, are pretty high for what you get. For the alcohol, I can justify this to cover the cost of carrying obscure barley wines (tremendous); to charge high prices for the food, is absolutely unacceptable. EAT at V.

Quality of the food ranges from standard to good, though there is usually nothing here that smacks of culinary sophistication (especially to justify charging $8.50 for a falafel sandwich!!). \u00a0When I'm feeling indulgent, I order the fish sandwich, which is all the greasy, crunchy-crusted fish I could want. \u00a0Appetizers here are decent. \u00a0The spinach and artichoke dip tastes like every homemade version I've sampled from friends' kitchens. \u00a0The beet chips with goat cheese are considered one of their hallmark dishes. \u00a0I agree they're good--when prepared properly. \u00a0It's a gamble. \u00a0Because of the color of the beets, I think it's difficult to distinguish when they're finished cooking; I often get beet chips that taste like black charcoal.When friends propose coming here for happy hour after work, I just kind of dread it. \u00a0Crane Alley presents itself as a bar/pub, but they are more like a formal restaurant that expects everyone to stay in their assigned seats. \u00a0As someone who's waited tables in the past, I know large groups are challenging, but the waitresses here look downright insulted when they realize they have to serve our table. \u00a0They mostly avoid our group and hope that we won't ask for anything more than one meal and one drink. \u00a0Once, we showed up at a busy hour with a group of 8 and had to wait to be seated. \u00a0No big deal. \u00a0No one was complaining, we just stood in a group and chatted amongst ourselves. \u00a0After a few minutes, the hostess approached us, obviously annoyed, and said, \"If you have a group this big in the future, you're going to have to call in advance to make a reservation.\" \u00a0...Ugh, really?Sadly, downtown Urbana does not offer many options for night life, especially if you want to have a nice drink with your meal. \u00a0Crane Alley has broad appeal and is a general crowd-pleaser, so it is a safe option for a date or outing with friends. \u00a0Just make sure you don't bring too many friends.",

They also toast the bun to give it an extra crunch. I normally eat half and save the other half for later, but I couldn't resist. My plate was completely cleaned by the time we left. I also ordered a small soup on the side, it was the blue cheese tomato soup and that was really great too! We came during lunch, so there was no wait at all.

Every table around us got this appetizer, since it is one of the dishes that Crane Alley is most known for. The beet chips come with a bowl of a goat cheese dip (which has cream cheese mixed in). The dip is somewhat rich and heavy, and helps to bulk up what might otherwise be a rather light appetizer.The sandwiches at Crane Alley run up to around $10, and the main courses a bit higher than that. Last visit, my girlfriend got a portabella mushroom burger, which was one of the daily specials, and of course had no meat. However, it was bulky enough to offset that and not be as light and unfilling as a lot of vegetarian food ends up being. I got a beer-battered fish sandwich, which was crispy and fairly large (way too much fish for the bun), along with the sweet potato fries (another thing Crane Alley is known for). One of the complaints I usually have about fried fish sandwiches is how greasy they are, but luckily this sandwich didn't fall into that trap.The primary lure that Crane Alley has is its wide selection of beers and drinks, which can be ordered alongside a selection of appetizers or food (something some local competitors do not offer). In addition, it has weekly special dishes and daily specials, and special beer and food pairings on set dates (tickets must usually be purchased). I would highly recommend anyone in the area or at the university make the effort to stop here at least once.",

The breaded chicken breast was crispy and cooked to perfection.Buffalo Chicken Sandwich- very good- HUGE portion. I prefer to get the Buffalo sauce and ranch (can't have blue cheese while pregnant) on the side and dip- otherwise the breading gets soggy. Chicken is very well cooked. Italian Roast Beef- the beef used was too lean- it was dry and chewy. Would benefit from using ribeye (like on a good Philly cheesesteak) or a well braised chuck roast that has enough fat to keep the meat tender. The au jus was not very flavorful- tasted mostly like oil + red pepper flakes. Nice beer list- they have beer dinners, ($65 or $75), but they wont' discount the ticket if you are unable to drink alcohol (e.g. pregnant me)- otherwise my husband and I would have loved to have gone to one.",

I will say though that if you go to Crane Alley, it's not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants (esp. not the alcohol). Another thing my friends and I noticed is that if you get appetizers, they normally give you way more dipping material (hummus, spinach and artichoke dip, etc.) than you can use up with the pita provided. You will get charged extra if you ask for more pita.They always have a nice selection of beverages, particularly beers, but there's a cocktail list as well (again, just plan on it being pricey). If fresh and local is important to you, they also sometimes have menu items made from products of sellers you might see at Market at the Square in the summer. In the end, it's a great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside in the evening with your friends in the actual alley part of Crane Alley.",

Not holding that against them. Great beer selection - which made us excited for the overall experience, but would be disappointed. While we were there, it appeared that about half the occupants of a local trailer park decided they wanted to bring all their kids to the bar at lunch time. These people were loud and obnoxious, and their kids treated the place like a playground. I was disappointed that staff made no attempted to settle the situation down... even a \"Hey, no running and screaming in bar.\" may have sufficed.Anyway, my wife had the steak sandwich and I had the Italian beef... both pretty much had zero taste. It wasn't bad by any means, but the food quality wasn't anywhere near what the presentation promised. \u00a0Like I said... just plain \"meh.\" We would not return the next time we're in town.",

I'm going to agree with that assessment: mostly good!I had the portobello sandwich, with peppers and a nice pesto topping. I was sort of disappointed when my friend said she wasn't into beet chips as an appetizer, but completely excited when I saw I could substitute my fries for beet chips! Yay! We ended up sharing the spinach and artichoke dip app. It came with toasted pita slices. Mmmmm. The food was interesting, and it was good. It wasn't fantastic, or mind-blowing, but it was solid, and the menu had a good variety of selections. The price wasn't super cheap, but it wasn't outrageous for lunch. My sandwich (plus beet chips, which do carry a surcharge as a substitution), my friend's entree (a bowl of the soup of the day and a Reuben), one soft drink and our appetizer = 28.79 before tip. The drink menu is HUGE! I'd love to come back for dinner and drinks sometime. The ambiance screams \"You're in a bar!!\" which considering that, hey! you're in a bar, that works. It was cozy, the lighting was low, the booths black - might be a nice place for a casual date. The one aspect that shone above all was the service. Our waiter was FANTASTIC. He was knowledgeable about the menu, helpful without being pushy or overbearing, very attentive, we had regular drink refills but he didn't make it hard for us to continue our conversation. He even brought us an assortment of to-go containers so we could keep the dip and pita chips separate - what a guy! That waiter deserves five stars (and a large tip)!",

The interior is clean and there is decent amount of space without some outdoor seating. Cashiers were nice and friendly.We enjoyed two crepes, a quiche, and a soup for breakfast. I really liked the quiche here. It's more eggy like an omelet but it was very aromatic with the bacon on the bottom. I think I ordered the Florentine quiche? The crepes are nice as well. It's not a very thin, delicate crepe, but I really liked the sweet cream inside along with the fruit. Its stuffed with the cream and what's nice is that it wasn't too sweet and it had a hint of acidity. I would skip the tomato soup with gouda here. It was too heavy in my taste - almost like a sauce.

When I asked for her recommendations she gladly offered a variety of her favorite treats and then gave me adequate time to decide what I'd like to try for myself.After much deliberation, I went with the scotch oatmeal cookie that the lovely cashier recommended along with an iced coffee. Just a heads up for anyone interested, their oatmeal cookies are the real deal, made with shortening and lots of love. So while the cookie was the perfect balance of \"crunchy AND chewy\" that the cashier promised it would be, this treat definitely serves as a more once in a while splurge in my book. There were a number of other delicious looking pastries, tiramisu, and cakes on display; it really was tough to choose!My total came to $3.25 which I thought was extremely affordable considering the use of local ingredients and the fact that, at some other coffee shops in town, you'd pay that much alone for a cookie or a coffee separately.I thoroughly enjoyed my cookie, but I also just really enjoyed the space. The noise level was prime for sitting down and getting some studying and busywork done on a lazy Friday late afternoon.The combination of friendly and accommodating staff, delicious products, and the cool bakery/coffee shop ambiance give Pekara a thumbs up in my book.

The sourdough was vaguely stale and warm, but it was not clear that it had been toasted. The cheese had been melted on the bread, not the meat; there was a single, sad slice that didn't even cover all of the sourdough. The ham was overly salty, cut thick. Nothing else comes on the sandwich -- the bread isn't clearly buttered, pressed, or anything. No condiments. Just generally unappetizing.

I frequently encounter quiche with an unappetizing dense, crumbling texture, so I was absolutely over the moon when I discovered Pekara's quiche lorraine--instead of a piece of dried-out egg cake, the filling is so superbly soft and velvety that it literally melts in your mouth. At the Urbana farmers' market, I'll stop by their stall and pick up a filled croissant, which are always crisp and flaky beyond belief (not the sad, soggy pastries that croissants can sometimes be). I also crave their savory roasted red pepper and Gouda soup--but I bet they buy it packaged from some wholesaler as I've eaten nearly identical versions at several other places in town.Next, the things I'm not so happy with. One morning I decided to stop in and pick up some treats for my workplace's coffee hour. Thinking it'd probably be a good bulk investment, I opted for a loaf of the pumpkin bread, which came out to more than $10. I've been able to pick up a loaf at other bakeries in town for around $5, so I was admittedly shocked, especially because the bread was very dry and not particularly special in any way. Some of their baked goods are fairly inconsistent in quality--so much that I've sometimes wondered if they switched owners/bakers. Recently, they've made attempts to introduce some of the classic items you'd see in a New York Italian bakery, but unfortunately their attempts lack heart. It's as if some of the cookies weren't properly taste-tested before making it to the shelves.For Pekara, I'd recommend the savory items (omelettes, sandwiches, salads, quiches) over the sweets.",

Because it looked quite appetizing I decided to eat it and am glad I did. Omelets are easy yet so difficult. I don't usually order them because they often come out too soupy or dry. This one was done perfectly - slightly fluffy and moist but not runny. The roasted vegetables were quite aromatic. We also had a chocolate banana crepe which was delicate, a decent portion, and rich. Pekara also carries extravagant cakes, croissants, breads, pastries, and coffee. Relaxing neighborhood joint with high quality food. 2 thumbs up!",

Hardly any foam. and then, i wanted to try something sweet so i ordered a cannoli. yeah. could not have been more disappointed.

The best thing are the portion sizes! When Penara or Atlanta Bread Co. give you a half sandwich it's more like a 1/4 sandwich.

My boyfriend and I were passing by the Pekara bakehouse and thought that it was the actual cafe and bakery and so rang the doorbell to the place (we were slightly suspicious after this moment that maybe we were at the wrong place). A woman baker answered the door and told us that in fact, we were not at the cafe but at their warehouse where they make all of the goodies every day. Despite the fact that this was already a pretty cool discovery, she spontaneously invited the two of us in and took the time to give us a quick tour of the bakery - and even gave us a sample treat at the end (which later, we tasted and it was absolutely amazing)!Afterwards, we of course had to go to the actual cafe and got some more treats, which didn't fail to amaze us yet again!",

My husband and I tried three other bakeries in town before we found Pekara, and this one stood out as the best in our opinions.",

It is one of a very few that actually MAKE their food, including breads, baked goods, crepes, soups, sandwiches, individual pizzas, and salads, in addition to coffee drinks.Pekara has now moved its baking operations to its own dedicated building (now that says something for a local successful biz, doesn't it?) to do more wholesale for local retail establishments (for example, you can find their bread at Common Grounds Food Coop, cookies at the Latte Da coffee shops in the public libraries and Carle on Windsor and baked goods at Pages for All Ages independent bookstore.I like their niche; the desserts are homey, yet professional (and they can do higher level European cakes and pastries). They have THE best spanokopita-type dish (much better than Greek versions-more like a spinach/cheese custard in filo), lovely cupcakes, great combos for soup/salad/sandwiches, and savory croissants. Oh, and did I say individual Babkas? Seating is a smart row of two chair/table setups with plenty of outlets down the hall, with a counter/bar stools in front, and larger table combos, couch/club chairs in the back. Warm weather brings a couple of tables in front, and a bricked patio in the back. The only problems I have seen are: parking (now w/the road closed, but at nights and weekends you can use the bank across the street), and sometimes poor staffing (the owners cannot be there 24/7) although this is to be expected with the high turnover of food service jobs. I have noticed that the past six months have gotten better with a couple of 'managerial' \u00a0level employees who are keeping the staff professional. This is a casual, nice place to bring someone for lunch, breakfast, a bit to eat in the evenings, to study, etc. It is not a sit down restaurant, and it can sometimes get complicated if you are eating with a group of four or more and you want to pay the bill for everyone (getting the orders in and together). \u00a0Lunchtime can get a bit crowded. Each person orders individually and the staff brings you your meals. The food arrives quickly, even the made to order crepes. They do nice box lunches, catering, and platters as well.",

It's mostly street parking, but I found lots of spots right out front.The lovely lady working welcomed us right away, and she was very helpful with her suggestions. I decided on a large light roast Ethiopian and an oatmeal, and the Mister got a large dark roast of some sort and a cinnamon roll as big as my head. The ceramic coffee mugs were huge, and the coffee was delicious. They even had organic cane syrup to sweeten it! My oatmeal was pre-packaged, but it was one of the healthier brands without anything artificial or tons of sugar. The Mister loved his goodies as well.The interior of Aroma Cafe is very cozy, but we decided to sit on the patio out back. It felt secret garden-ish, and it was the perfect setting for a lazy Sunday breakfast. If you're in the CU area, then you should totally check out this place. Friendly people, good coffee, and tasty treats... what else could you want?",

The atmosphere is usually quieter than Kopi, and there is plenty of seating on most days; the staff is friendly and polite and know their way around a kitchen. There are outlets all along the walls, and free wifi, if that's what you're looking for. *See edit*I'm addicted to the vanilla chai, but I really go there for the raspberry white chocolate scones. I challenge you to find a better scone in the world! Okay, well, maybe not the world, but they trump any pastry in every coffee shop I've ever visited. When I've been on the road, this is the first place I come back to. Aroma is home!Also, the salsa here is amazing. It is house-made and there are two kinds: try the one with the peaches. I get it as a side with my cheese quesadilla, which is also tasty and totally worth spending my lunch money on!Edit: 5/20/2012Since I last reviewed Aroma, it has gone through a lot of changes, including new ownership. What's bad about this is they took away almost every single thing I loved. Those unparalleled raspberry white chocolate scones? Gone. Now they serve bloated English scones from Sweet Indulgences that are as dry and tasteless as the Sahara. Massive, extraordinary fail. I mean, there used to be epic Scone Wars over Aroma's scones--I used to try to beat these elderly ladies who worked downtown to the cafe to get my share. For real. Now the new scones just sit on a plate, untouched and unwanted, fat blobs of loathing. Anybody who likes them never had the original, heavenly scones of old. They're not even in the same category of pastry, I tell you. They offer other pastries from Sweet Indulgences, too, but they're all really expensive and not what I would eat for breakfast. (Old habits die hard.) They still sell apple fritters, I guess.They tried to get rid of my beloved chai, as well, but then the new baristas were too mentally challenged to make bagged chai tea and they had to revert back to the mix. I guess leaving a tea bag in a cup of steamed milk requires too much comprehension. I'm glad for it, anyway, because if natural bagged chai is your thing, nobody in town is better than Kopi, which is just around the block. Competing against them is just a waste of time, so they're safer to keep the chai mix and go with what their customers already know and love.Also, that amazing peach salsa? Yup, it's gone now, too. Forever. The whole menu has been revamped to have fancier, slightly healthier offering. I haven't been desperate enough to try any of their new food items except for the fruit salad, which is basically a bowl of chopped fruit with a yummy syrup over it, and that was good, but it was just for breakfast. I will say they seem to have spared most of their old menu's wraps and other lunch items for the time being. The Wi-Fi is also password-protected now (\"sexytoast\" is the key). At least they didn't insert that proposed \"kid corner\" they threatened us with earlier during the revamp. That would've sent me running for the hills instantly. As someone who comes in here regularly to find quiet and write, I can tell you the very last thing I want is to share space with a corner of screaming, running toddlers. I deducted Aroma a star for all of this, but find it hard to give it less than 4 stars. I've been coming to Aroma for seven years, so I think of it as my home away from home, even if it currently is a shell of what it once was. Some of the other regular customers I used to see in here are thinning out. I guess all of this will make it easier for when I move from Champaign, because now it's just depressing.",

Service was super slow and less than stellar: 2/5We arrived around 11:30 on a Sunday morning and were told we would have to wait 20-30 minutes since we hadn't made a reservation. Ok, fine that seemed reasonable enough and maybe would be a testament to the quality of the restaurant, I figured. Time easily killed by a walk around downtown. The hostess said that we could leave our phone number with them, and they would call us when it was our turn to be seated. A nice touch, I thought.We never received that phone call, but wandered back of our own accord some 15-20 minutes later, and our table was ready. We received menus promptly, and then spent the next fifteen minutes waiting for our waiter. When he finally showed up he did apologize for not coming by sooner, asked us if it was our first time there (yes, for myself and one other in my party), and then proceeded to describe Radio Maria's menu: the uniqueness of the Mexican inspired breakfast items, the deliciousness of the omelettes, etc. I think I would have really appreciated that primer if I had not already had the opportunity to read over the menu several times while we had been waiting for him to show up. He seemed really startled when we informed him we were actually ready to order, because clearly he was not ready to take them, citing the drinks he had to bring to another table. So cue another wait...All in all, we saw two tables that had been seated after us order food, receive their food, finish eating, and pay in the before we had gotten ours. Which points to less of a systemic problem (because, clearly, some patrons DO get their food in a timely manner), and maybe more of an individual issue. Our waiter did seem very harried, and I would venture to say even distressed, so maybe there is an issue with the division of work. I did notice that another employee stepped to help with water refills, but during only the last quarter of our meal.FOOD : We ordered: two veggie masa boats, vegetarian Eggs Benedict, Mexican coffees,and a side of beer bread.Rated from best to worst:Veggie masa boats (4.5/5): perfectly cooked eggs, and the masa black bean and tomato combo worked for me. What did not work: the goat cheese. I actually would have liked something a wee bit less salty and more melty, but I was in the minority at my table on this one.Vegetarian eggs Benedict (4/5): I guess I am used to versions with meat, but I could have done with a little more salt or other sort of seasoning. The slice of tomato/avocado combination didn't do anything for me.Beer bread (2/5): really dry and cakeyMexican coffee (1/5): Came with a half-inch of spice grounds at the bottom, and was cloyingly sweet (The upside to this is that a refill of regular coffee, added to the grounds, makes for an actually drinkable beverage).Overall... meh. I could overlook the service issues if the food were truly crave-worthy, but I did not find that to be the case.",

Since it was early in the morning on a weekend, we liked to start out our meal with some nice coffee. Not gonna lie, if you are looking to some authentic Mexican coffee, save it. Their coffee was not their highlight. They offered two specials that day: an omelette and a stuffed chili pepper. We listened to our friendly waiter's recommendation and ordered one of each. Their baked potatoes that accompanied the core of the meals were phenomenal! The temperature was perfectly controlled and all the pieces of the potatoes were cooked evenly, and just right. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with just the right amount of salt to make it appeal to the tongues. It is very hard for me to describe the main courses in details, since there was a lot going on, but just know that food is served in a timely fashion, and the impact of the flavors truly made the visit an overall enjoyable experience. Definitely keep a lookout on the specials if you want something more memorable.  The restaurant itself is very clean, and was decorated with interesting Hispanic things that created an unique atmosphere that made it ideal for 1 on 1 dining.

It is large, and I would guess that it is very well attended. (Lots of people tried to get in but were turned away due to the party.) They had one of the largest liquor selections I've seen, and they even have infused liquors. I tried the maple-bacon burbon - good, but a little too sweet for my tastes. Their infused liquors are all made on premises. The bartender told me he did it himself - and for the party, he wore a kilt.The dining room is large. We had a limited menu with four choices and we all pre-ordered our meals. I have to say that the salad served before the dinner was really excellent, fresh, simple and just the right amount of dressing. I can't say as much for the meal - I had smoked ribs. They were pretty tough, but did have a good taste.They also have tables on the sidewalk which we took advantage of.

Mussels: Really complex flavorful broth with well cooked and meaty mussels. The toast they came with was top notch, also.Lamb meatballs: Tasty, especially with hidden gems of pine nuts. If you really like meatballs, I definitely recommend these. Garlic shrimp: Four plump and juicy shrimp hanging out on a large piece of toast with a mayo based sauce.

We had several tapas and one appetizer, and the fried goat cheese was our favorite, so delicious and creamy, and it is served with a light jam that makes a wonderful combination.-The pork tacos were also delicious, and obviously slow cooked, very delicious.-The service was excellent, especially for how busy everything was (they were tripled booked for Valentine's).-The homemade ricotta gnudi were also delicious, especially with the sauteed mushrooms that accompanied it. -We also ordered a flight of ice cream that featured a mint chocolate cake flavor which was extremely aromatic, and smelled like I was walking through an herb garden, delicious. The Meh:-Personally, I was not a fan of the arancini, to me all I could taste was a fried greasy taste.Overall:-Would definitely return! Especially for date night, it's a fantastic place.",

There were some tables outside, a rather large bar area inside, high tops, large half moon booths, and a separate dining room. Without reservations for a busy Saturday night the wait was not bad at less than 30 minutes. The host and server in charge of the outside patio were enthusiastic and kind striking small talk during the wait which made me excited for my meal! Once seated our actual server seemed distracted or slammed. Between 2 of us we ordered 4 dishes (tapas) and 2 drinks and were full. Goat cheese with pumpkin seeds/spices, eggplant frites, risotto balls, potato/charizo/egg dish = all tasty. The bill came in under $40! From being indifferent prior to dining here I now wish I did sooner. Radio Maria seems to have great drink deals, happy hour, and brunch.",

Regular specials make some variation on the menu. \u00a0Coffee is aromatic and high quality. Wait-staff at Radio rarely makes mistakes: they're natural and easy and very good.As for other things, their beer selection is as good as any of the craft beer bars in downtown Champaign (Blind Pig, Quality, Big Grove, etc) but I often forget about it as a choice.4-stars overall only because the tapas menu, while tasty, can get really pricy for the portion sizes. This is what tapas is about I suppose, but also means I don't choose to head here in the evening as often.",

I love enjoying late afternoon tapas on a warm summer day with great drinks and better friends. I'm not forgetting the great selection of entrees this restaurant/bar offers, but in typical Spanish fashion, I usually fill up on beer and tapas before I can even contemplate dinner. While they don't serve dinner all night long, they do continue serving their most popular tapas until close.

Once just for drinks and the second time for dinner and drinks. Although I came for dinner the second time, I was so drawn to the bar that I ate dinner with my friends at the bar. You see the back-lit bar once you walk in, and I swear you will walk toward it like it's force is pulling you to it. It's captivating. Like a kid following a chocolate bar being held in front of him... if you're not drawn to the bar, something is wrong with you.I've only had one dinner item on the menu, so I'm no expert, but I can tell you that the menu is stellar. The offerings are really impressive; there is something on the menu for everyone. The food is upscale in terms of components - you can tell just by reading the menu. It's also upscale in taste. I had the veggie green curry. As a self-proclaimed curry master, I have to give it my thumbs up. Delicious.If you're a \"drinks over food\" type of person. This is your spot. The drink menu is probably 4x as big as the food menu. I would say RM got this ratio just right. They have a crazy good drink menu, and if the blue bar won't keep you coming back, the drink menu will.Last tid bit - the service is great. The waiters and bartenders are really nice and super helpful. No reason not to come here, unless you're afraid you'll never leave (good possibility).",

What a treat! \u00a0I had partaken of too many tapas so my husband had to finish mine, now that is a generous portion.We had a great meal, my sangria mellowed me out after like 4 sips, the Illini had won and the weather was beautiful. \u00a0When the sizable check arrived I might have blanched at bit under normal circumstances but my husband and I just laughed and put it on a credit card.It was a great meal with the family but very expensive. \u00a0 Next game, those kids are getting pizza or burgers! \u00a0 \u00a1Ol\u00e9!",

Tonight, we finally had dinner at the infamous Champaign culinary sensation.The food offering was a mish-mash of cuisines - South American, Asian, Mediterranean, Spanish - and seemed to lack a consistent and unifying theme/thread/philosophy. These types of menus are generally red flags for me because they say: I can do a breadth of styles good, but not one style great.We started off sharing the mezze plate. Pita was pizza dough-y, but buttery too...strange, in my opinion. Also, I found the couscous bland. Best part was the hummus, which I was wishing they served more of.For dinner I ordered the crabcakes, which were more like crabballs. Goat cheese potato pancakes were crisp, but lacked seasoning. Radio Maria's Haitian slaw was flavorless and served merely as decoration on my plate - I hate to say it, but KFC's got better slaw! Positives about the crabballs - they weren't THAT bad and you get three in an order. If you order this, ask for extra garlic aioli (probably best to ask for it on the side). I probably would've enjoyed my balls (but, really...who doesn't?!) more if I had extra aioli.Beau ordered the adobo pork.

RM is situated in the bustling Downtown, and sports an eclectic modern decor with latin touches. The Tapas Lounge is all-modern, with changing exhibitions for wall-art, and a Euro-chic cleanliness, not typically found in the mid-west. I will talk of the awesome Tapas 'experience' at a later date, but this blog is devoted to our last night in The Dining Room.With an exceptional wine-list, dinner at RM always begins and ends well in terms of drinking options. One of the best things for me is that no matter what mood I am in financially, (from big-night-out, to my typical tuesday-night-budget) there are so many choices of great tasting vino. Although RM changes its menu about once a year, they (thankfully) keep many of their favorites available, such as the Coffee Filet, Peppercorn Tuna steak, New York Strip and appetizers Seared Avocado with Quinoa salad and Grilled Goats Cheese Medallions in pesto. All dishes have latin-fusion inspired flavors, plenty of warm chile, spicy cream, mole and guacamole sauces.Service at RM is impeccable. Quick, but tastefully so, timing is almost always perfect, polite and sophisticated. Their knowledgeable sommelier staff are very helpful for beginners and experienced wine-drinkers alike. Dinner is not cheap for the average mid-west dining clientele, but compared to similar dining rooms in larger cities, I think Radio Maria is worth double whatever the bill is.ALWAYS order the special, their young, fashionable chefs always deliver. Expect to spend $60-$80 on food for 3 courses for 2 people in the restaurant, or $40-$60 in the tapas lounge.",

Tonight, we finally had dinner at the infamous Champaign culinary sensation.The food offering was a mish-mash of cuisines - South American, Asian, Mediterranean, Spanish - and seemed to lack a consistent and unifying theme/thread/philosophy. These types of menus are generally red flags for me because they say: I can do a breadth of styles good, but not one style great.We started off sharing the mezze plate. Pita was pizza dough-y, but buttery too...strange, in my opinion. Also, I found the couscous bland. Best part was the hummus, which I was wishing they served more of.For dinner I ordered the crabcakes, which were more like crabballs. Goat cheese potato pancakes were crisp, but lacked seasoning. Radio Maria's Haitian slaw was flavorless and served merely as decoration on my plate - I hate to say it, but KFC's got better slaw! Positives about the crabballs - they weren't THAT bad and you get three in an order. If you order this, ask for extra garlic aioli (probably best to ask for it on the side). I probably would've enjoyed my balls (but, really...who doesn't?!) more if I had extra aioli.Beau ordered the adobo pork. Generous hunk of pig, the orange-bourbon BBQ sauce starts sweet on the tongue, then finishes with a kick...flavor was decent, but I wasn't expecting or enjoying this sweet sweet meat (SHOCK, I know!).

Their menu varies, but just tonight I tried a couple of tapas (fried mozzarella and calamari) and the mushroom ravioli. All were delicious and well presented.My warm chocolate cake dessert, however, tasted soggy and generally unpleasant. It came with a scoop of some oddly flavored ice cream---I think it was meant to be mint, but it tasted more like horseradish. Not the best way to end a dinner; fortunately the rest of the meal was good enough to make up for it.Our server tonight did a thoroughly wonderful job. But overall service in the restaurant felt slightly slow, even on this quiet Monday night when my party was one of only two or three in the entire restaurant for a whole two hours. Halfway through our meal I noticed a middle-aged woman abruptly exit the restaurant despite pleas from her waiter. There was no commotion: it appeared the customer left, after settling down but before ordering, simply to protest the service speed.If I had to nitpick, I'd add that the men's restroom was a little worn and unkempt in the details for a restaurant of this caliber. The lock was also broken. Holistically, though, I had a great dining experience here.Quick tip to first-time diners: Free parking is kitty-corner to the restaurant in a third-party lot.

Here goes:My fellow students and I had organized a fundraiser to be held at R.M. We were raffling off some of our artwork and had ordered a substantial amount of food because we were expecting 50+ guests. Around 8:30pm, there was an AWFUL stench that filled the bar area, followed by a watery mist that began to fall from the ceiling along the west wall of tables. There were a number of people sitting in this area (myself included), who were covered in this putrid water (I had to go home and shower!!!). The food we ordered which was on a nearby table, was also covered. I alerted the manager who said to me \"It must be our pipes again.\" Again? This has happened to other customers? The manager then called the fire department in to inspect the pipes running along the ceiling, while our guests (those who were left) crowded awkwardly around the bar. \u00a0The manager took no action in remedying the situation. Our food was NOT replaced, and the water on the tables and chairs was NOT wiped up, so that the guests could resume sitting. The artwork that was hanging on the wall was also damaged by the water, and was NOT compensated for. Radio Maria had quoted us for the cost of food prior to the event, but when we received our bill, it was over twice what they had quoted. Worse yet, the manager only refunded us the cost of one cheese plate. Thanks. You're swell. \u00a0This matter is still not resolved as the owners of Radio Maria seem to think they owe us nothing. I disagree, and until we receive just compensation, I will not be returning and hope you don't either.",

Do not rest on your laurels because that way failure lies...I don't get to go to Radio Maria as often as I used to. It has a fond place in my heart, which is probably good for them as I'm not dinging them as much as I could in this review. RM was one of the first hip businesses that launched the downtown revival (along with The Blind Pig, v 1.0) and for that I have much love.The last few times we've gone, we've sat outside and had tapas. Now I'm no tapas expert, but I believe you usually order a bunch of tapas and they come out one-at-a-time to your table so you can experience each dish on its own merits. \u00a0RM, however, always sends out all the tapas all at the same time. Everything becomes a mish-mash and it's overwhelming and nothing stands out. \u00a0You also immediately get abandoned by the waitstaff so you have to wait forever to order another drink or get/pay your check. Also, the pretty pretty people who work there don't like kids. That would be fair if we were dragging the kids inside and interrupting the restaurant. But even if your kids are well-behaved and you're sitting outside, you catch a real snotty attitude. I am happy to report, however, that they do have a real highchair. When my eldest was a baby they had a beautiful vintage deathtrap highchair. They now have one that is still aesthetically pleasing, but without all the metal.The restaurant itself is still lovely. I just wish they'd shape up their staff so it wasn't so depressing to interact with them.",

Never had a bad meal, although sometimes it was marred with indifferent service of the \"I am a hipster working in the hippest restaurant in town! What, you want me to DO WORK?\" type. Brunch was awesome; a lot cheaper than dinner so my impoverished self could get a fix when mom and dad weren't paying. The beer bread, yes, and the masa boat, yes! And at the time they opened, renovating a decrepit downtown location to expose the brick walls and original tin ceilings was a new idea. They kickstarted a great trend. Downtown Champaign wouldn't be what it is today without Radio Maria. I remember going to that space to pick out wallpaper with my mom and dad back in the 80's. Radio Maria is a vast improvement.",

I was the only one that ordered for the four of us and our waiter just starred at us for awhile asking if we were sure that's all we wanted. You could tell he hadn't been working there long as he had to ask the kitchen twice about what was in some of the different sauces and I had to repeat my order twice so that he could remember it. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Crostini, Smoked Pork Tacos and Sauteed Calamari. My favorite was the Wild Mushroom Crostini. The mixture of the cheese, fried egg and mushrooms with the crunch of the bread made it delicious. The Sauteed Calamari was an interesting dish with a lot of flavor. It came out in a soup dish so it was great to dip just some of the bread in the sauce. The Pork Tacos were my least favorite as there was too much green onion for my liking.The food was good but each dish was made for two people rather than four. As we were finishing our plates, a waitress cleaned our table without asking if we were done, which peeved me because I wasn't done with the calamari.",

It was a very busy night, but our waitress was obviously assigned to too many tables. It too a long time for her to take our order and she forgot to bring the basket of chips initially. We were also seated by the window and the heating was poor. I was lucky I was wearing a warm dress, because I saw people near us having to wear their jackets while dining. I enjoyed my appetizer of figs with honey and gouda and the chips had a tasty aioli dip, but the main courses were less impressive. I had the Torta Maria, which sounded fascinating, but it ended up being a heap of flavors that really didn't stand out. My date's chicken breast was teeny tiny and he did not enjoy the accompanying slaw. The dessert menu was a bit boring, but the pot de creme was good. I also tried the tapas bar recently, which was a slightly better experience. The salmon skewers with cucumber were perfectly spiced and delectable. The balsamic fruit with manchego on bread was good as well. However, the lamb skewers...they were like meatloaf on a stick. The tapas are a good way to try several dishes, but they are overpriced considering how little you get and that I could probably grill salmon and put it on a stick myself. The exception would have been if the little dishes displayed exceptional artistry, such as Cafe Luna's.",

The portions of everything are very good - not too much food, but plenty to satisfy you.The wait staff has always been nice and helpful, if a bit distracted sometimes. Friendly people, good service.It's definitely one of my favorite restaurants, I go whenever I get the chance, and recommend it to anyone!Note: Many people have reviewed Radio Maria negatively. I think they need to put it in context of local restaurants. We're in Champaign-Urbana, not New York or Seattle. While we should have high standards, we just don't have the variety (and therefore competition) to create a large foody restaurant culture. I also think they need to stop being so negative.

Everything I ordered was great, but the potatoes were AMAZING! \u00a0They were crispy and had a delicious flavor because they were hickory smoked. \u00a0They also came with a delicate drizzle of the most delicious sauce, I wish I knew the ingredients so I could re-create this dish. \u00a0I can't wait to come back to have them again!",

I like their omelets, especially the smoked trout one, I like the potato and beer bread that comes on the side. The omelets are enormous and I think the Radio Maria approach (tons and tons of ingredients) works in that context. They'll make you a Bloody Mary with horseradish which I love. The dinners are another story. I've probably eaten here five or six times in the last few years, and I don't get a lot out of anything on their dinner or the tapas menus. Maybe I consistently order the wrong things, but the food is either over- or undercooked or weirdly chewy or bland or greasy. I have friends who rave about the eggplant frites but they are just a greasy mess to me. The wine is usually fine but most of the cocktails are silly, like sorority-girl/moms'-night-out drinks. There was one thing they had years ago that I loved -- grilled asparagus with a fried egg and a drizzle of balsamic. It was simple and delicious. If they still had that I wouldn't dread meeting people here for dinner.",

The apples were not cut to order and were not crisp even though it was stored in a container of lemon juice. The bacon was not reheated...I mean who likes cold bacon? For pur entrees we ordered the scallops and duck meatloaf. The scallops were good however I personally didnt appreciate the jam that went with it...could have done with a spicy savory sauce. The duck was unknowingly served with the same exact jam. It was a tad too sweet for our tastes, but regardless of that...the meatloaf was absolutely amazing. The egg that topped it however was a bit overcooked so the sunnyside up yolk could not be used as a sauce. Our final conclusion is that the main part of the entreeswere cooked to order, as they should be, but all the garnish was precooked and we got the feeling that it was just thrown on...not worth the price.",

For the most part, the food was good, but there were a couple clunkers. We ordered the a number of tapas, including arancini, pork belly arepa, diver scallops, crab tart, pork tacos, and beignets. The arancini were nicely done, if slightly overpowered by the breading. The pork belly arepa, however, was not made with pork belly and the diver scallops were not diver scallops. I believe the arepa was made with pork shoulder, and was good, but no one ever said anything about the change. Similarly, the scallops were very well done, but were not diver scallops. The crab tart, on the other hand, was a clunker, as were the beignets. The tart was made of corn bread and I don't know that I've ever had a more dried out piece of corn bread in my life. It totally overshadowed the crab. The beignets were huge, which meant they weren't cooked through. They were like eating a heavy cake doughnut, not the light crunchy wonder they should be. The best dish of the night was the tacos. Smoky, spicy, delicious. We will probably go back, but will be much more careful in selecting our dishes.",

The torta Maria and smoked port torta are unusual and always good. Each week the brunch specials usually include a special omelette, scrambler, and a sandwich. The omelettes are only OK; somehow they seem a bit dry and overcooked.My main complaint with brunch is the coffee. For my past several visits it's been quite weak and it's hard to get a refill. At a weekend brunch, I do expect good, hot coffee and not to go 20 minutes with my cup empty.For dinner, I think Radio is trying to present itself as more upscale and trendy than it is. A few years ago, the menu had a much more pronounced Carribean/Cuban/South American flair to it, and I miss that. I'm sure everything on the menu is very well-prepared, but it all seems like dishes I can get at any number of places.For my last dinner experienced there, I had a tenderloin special. It consisted of two pieces of tenderloin, one correctly medium, one well-done; six gnocchi (I counted); and a scattering of green peas. I believe the sauce mentioned in the description was absent. We did have a large party, but we were sitting at an empty table for nearly an hour before our food was ready; no salads, no bread. I guess we were expected to order cocktails and appetizers. Everything was tasty and was artistically arranged on an appropriately-trendy rectangular plate, but the portions were quite small. I shouldn't leave a restaurant after a $30 entree feeling a bit peckish.I feel like Radio can't decide what it is. A fancy drink bar? A tapas bar? A haute cuisine restaurant? It does all those things fairly well, but none of them exceptionally.",

We ordered a couple glasses of pinot noir and were happy with their selection. Our appetizer, the broiled goat cheese, was amazing. The grilled bread provided great texture to the meaty pumpkin seed and spice spread and the divine creaminess of the goat cheese. Our entrees were the two dinner specials for the evening, seared diver scallops and a filet. Our scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The accompanying puree had pieces of bacon which perfectly complemented the entire dish. Our filet was a beautiful medium-rare piece of meat that just melted in my mouth. The bourbon demi glace and gratin brought the dish together into a very enjoyable experience. We tried two desserts, the molten chocolate cake and the green tea white chocolate mousse. I absolutely loved the mousse while my partner preferred the chocolate cake. The best part of the rich chocolate cake was the fresh mint ice cream that came with it. Overall it was an amazing dinner. Go to Radio Maria and order their dinner specials. You will not be disappointed.",

I feel like either the town finally realized that it would be wise to start spiffing its image up a bit to attract more students' $$ \u00a0by spending some $$ or else maybe in the last 8 years, CU's been adopted by a millionaire benefactor with desire to see a small town emulate a big bad city in its gastric offerings. The restaurant scene here has improved phenomenally. My boyfriend and I popped into Radio Maria after being turned away from Bacaro for not having a reservation on a Saturday night. We both had to giggle a little as that's never happened to either of us before in Chicago but it's good to get rejected every now and then. The waitress was apologetic and nice enough about it. So next door to Radio it was and I'm so glad we gave it a chance. We hadn't been in the mood for tapas until we opened the menu. Surprisingly innovative, interesting and very hip. We tried the smoked red potatoes with aioli, the fire roasted pears with manchego shavings and fennel, spanish fusilli pasta salad with olives (which I didn't want to fuss with at first b/c I hate spitting out seeds in public but they were pitted, nice touch) and spanish olive oil. I'm not a big dessert person but since I'd been enjoying the meal so much, I splurged and ordered the pumpkin cheesecake with cinnamon cream sauce. Still thinking about it a day later...the restaurant's decor was again surprisingly hip for Champaign. The bar is lit in blue from beneath and the artwork was very urban/Japanese. There was this cool light box banner thing running the length of the artfully splash-painted brick walls that I'd love to have in our house back in Chicago. Check it out if you're in town.

We were treated well and served professionally as we stayed all evening (7-11 PM). The drinks were good, though I'd say the beer was a bit small for the otherwise fair price. The odd thing is that the food is irrationally high priced - at least for the entrees. Our group of 4 ordered 3 of the specials and 1 menu item. The specials (which are not priced on the board) were simple plates of an entree & a \"decorative\" side. I ordered the Paella from the menu. The Paella was a 6 inch skillet of rice and seafood - 3 or so pieces each of shrimp and scallops, with some hard cooked sausage slices throughout. Good, but not special. Two of the specials were a fillet with a garlic crust - 4 oz of good meat. So what's the issue? Well $30 for the fillet and $24 for the Paella is an outrage for a remodeled VFW in a College town. This pricing is just too much like Soho/Manhattan - but it is Central Illinois! So go for the drinks and the Salsa Dancing after 10:30, but skip the food - it just is not worth it.",

The margarita I ordered was spot on. Not to strong, not to watered down. And their prices are extremely reasonable.

Character oozes out of every wood poor here. Really laid back and relaxing. The service is good. The bar tenders know their stuff, and are usually quick. \u00a0Sometimes it takes a little to get noticed.The house beers are great. Usually 3-4. There was a Winter Warmer, a Belgian Dark, and an IPA the first time I visited. The house beers are constantly rotating, and they are always something interesting and unique (A Peach Wit, Dry Hopped Pale, Cherry Stout, Barleywines). They also have about 15 taps of other good micros and imports that rotates regularly as well. There is always something different to try. There are a ton of bottles as well. The quality is always exceptional, just fresh as can be.You can't beat a quality brewpub, and this one is excellent. Very fresh and always enjoyable.

I finally did a year or so ago right after we moved to Indiana. I was just looking for a day trip and it seemed like a good idea. I hit the Blind Pig when it opened on that Tuesday because they were listed on a site as brewing their own draft beer. Since then, I've come out to Champaign twice more and will be back again, and the Blind Pig has a lot to do with that. This is a great beer bar. In fact, it's become one of my top ten beer bars in the country.One thing that makes it a great beer bar is a great draft list that the staff really gets behind and knows a lot about. It changes regularly, but it's always really interesting and from various places around the country. Last time I was in there, they had a Two Brothers, a Left Hand, a Schlafly and a Stone, and I don't believe I had had any of the particular varieties, even though I'm a regular drinker of all those breweries. They also do their own beer. Sure, it's hit or miss, but they're trying. And you get some really good stuff sometimes. Downside, as mentioned, is that it's really small batch, so you're lucky to find the same house beer on tap for two consecutive weeks. They do reuse recipes though so it may come back.What I really like about the Pig is the vibe. This is very much a locals place. In fact, the first time I heard the word \"townie\" used non-sarcastically was by a bartender here (it's more of a Midwestern thing, I guess, because I've heard it several times since). But it's a local beer snob place. The regulars here are a little old and drunkenly, but they really care about their beer, which is why they come back. I've always met interesting people here when I've come.But the main reason I come back: mug club. For $5 you can buy a Blind Pig mug, which you can choose to leave there or take home. And that mug gets you $2 off all drafts on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. As a result, I've always gotten out of there well toasted for under $20.The interior has old college town bar written all over it (although it's certainly not an undergrad sort of place), and it has a very nice patio in the back. They tend to have good music, but it's at the bartender's whim, so it varies. No food. I've seen it brought in, but I wouldn't try to bring it in myself.I should add, also, that, although I'm not really a liquor drinker, they seem to have a very good liquor selection.

The decor and atmosphere are great. The beer list is good too; mostly bottles. It's the place to go to support your Michigan breweries! If only they'd order some Shorts. Their own craft brews have generally been okay, but supply does seem to run out quickly. This isn't really an issue for me since there's plenty of other beers on the menu I've never tried, but if you're coming specifically to try some local beer you might go home disappointed.The one other knock is that it can be hard to get served when it's busy (just like 90% of other bard, I suppose). The narrow physical space of the bar means that traversing it is difficult when there's more than a couple people waiting to order.All in all, though, definitely worth the modest prices.

I recommend the Wietbier and Hard Cider, both out during the spring and summer season. They also have a wide mix of bottles and ever-changing draft selection, along with the four or five micro-brews to go along with the full bar. There prices are reasonable for the area. The micro-brews typically run between four to six dollars. The only downside to the menu is the complete lack of food: no appetizers or peanuts here.This is a simple but fun bar and is especially good for afternoon get-togethers or cocktail hours in the early weekday afternoons. Something is always on special. Because they are in downtown Champaign, the management keeps a close eye on the clientele to be sure no underclassmen filter through.

The wide availability of outdoor seating makes the Brewery better than the Pig for people who enjoy fresh air over enclosed caverns of noisy stuffiness. 2. Beer Club Mondays have a $1 off bottled beers which allows others to experience an incredibly wide array of European and specialized microbrews. Also its fun to attempt to conquer the long list of beers. 3. Trivia on Sundays.

When the place fills up-- and it doesn't take much-- it can be difficult to shoulder past the people standing at the bar.Saving graces are a modest and decent bottle selection as well as several guest taps, and the presence of a nice-sized outdoor seating section that's good for the 7 or 8 months a year it's not too cold, snowy, or rainy outside.Bottom line is that I've been giving this place a chance since shortly after it opened, but sadly it hasn't seemed to come around to be the kind of place that's inviting enough for me to frequent.(From reading other reviews I should also point out that more than a few people are getting the Blind Pig Brewery confused with The Blind Pig Pub.

But the cashiers were speedy and maybe the customers were decisive as well. The concept of this place is similar to that of Chipotle--you pick what toppings you want on your burger or you can choose one of their predefined burgers. \u00a0I went with the second option and ordered the californian with regular fries and a drink which came to a total of just under $12. \u00a0Kind of a lot for a meal at a fast-food like place but I was hungry so whatever. My meal was pretty good and there was a ton of fries in the \"regular\" portion. \u00a0They were thin and crispy as well which I loved. \u00a0The burger itself was good, it did fall apart a little bit when I tried to eat it, but there were a good amount of toppings so that was predictable. \u00a0I was disappointed in the amount of cucumber wasabi on my burger as I was really looking forward to that. \u00a0I feel like I only tasted it in one bite. \u00a0Instead I just added some of the specialty spicy chipotle kethcup available which was delicious and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like ketchup and eats her fries dry. \u00a0They also have Coca-Cola freestyle machines were you can pretty much have any Coke drink imaginable so that's cool. It also means the person in line behind me gets irritated because I like to check out all of my options before making a decision.",

We have them at every decent burger place up here in Chicago (I'm a Champaign native though fyi) and I think it just legitimizes the fact that you're paying for more for \"just a burger\".

However...Our order was taken promptly, we were seated promptly although the tables were really close together and we felt like we were setting with six other people at our table. Even though the good folks setting on either side of us were pleasant and courteous, the seating did not make for a comfortable dining experience.I had a third pound meathead burger with all the fixings, a regular fry and drink. Our order was ready in supersonic record setting time and was brought to our table by a server. The burger was tasty and I really enjoyed the fresh cut fries. However...I understand turnover is important, especially on a busy Saturday night, and management wants to push as many people through the line as possible, but be reasonable. I have never felt so rushed or pushed to finish my meal as I was tonight at Meatheads. It was ridiculous! I barely got my last fry into my mouth before someone was hovering over me wanting to clear the table (and have me leave). Maybe it would be different say at 3:00 on a Tuesday afternoon. Maybe someday I'll find, or maybe not.",

We've tried them all, and they're all great. \u00a0I've eaten burgers at a lot of places in CU and I'd say Meatheads ties with Crane Alley for my favorite burgers. \u00a0(I even like them better than, e.g. Seven Saints, Destihl, and other high end places.) \u00a0Crane Alley has fancier ingredients, but the quality is at the same high level at both places. \u00a0I think that's very impressive for fast food.The other meals are good too. \u00a0My daughter loves the chicken tenders, which are crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, unlike the dry chewy stuff you get at many fast food places. \u00a0She also loves the hot dog, which is a real footlong.The fries are really, really good. \u00a0And this is surprising considering they make them from fresh potatoes. \u00a0Most places that I have been to that make fresh-cut fries (including, e.g. Five Guys) make a soggy, greasy mess that tastes like raw potatoes. \u00a0Meatheads makes a hot, crispy pile of deliciousness that is really hard to beat. \u00a0And with the cajun seasoning on them they are my favorite fries in town. \u00a0FWIW they will also put things on them (bacon, cheese, etc.) if you want.The management at Meatheads is superb. \u00a0Whenever we go at a busy meal time when the place is packed, the manager is always out on the floor watching *everything* and picking up the slack wherever it's necessary. \u00a0This is exactly what a manager should be doing, but it is so rare in fast food that it is actually a pleasure to watch him and his employees do their jobs. \u00a0It's like watching a well-oiled machine.Cooking is my hobby. \u00a0I love fancy food. \u00a0But this place is my guilty pleasure. \u00a0I never thought I'd say this about a fast food restaurant, but to be honest it is my favorite American restaurant in town.",

        "review": "The burgers are definitely a cut above. They are comparable in price to the nice burgers in town at the Courier, Esquire, Crane Alley, etc. ($4-$7, depending on what you order). My husband still thinks that the Courier has the best burgers, but Meatheads blew the competition away for me. You get a larger portion of excellent tasting beef for the price. Every burger has at least two patties. Nearly everything about my regular meathead burger was perfect. The only room for improvement is the bun...but it wasn't bad at all--just not as gourmet as the rest of the burger. They have lots of fancy options. My husband really liked his Cajun Burger (although it was pretty messy to eat!) The fries are fresh, cut thin with skins on, and also served in large quantities. I have yet to try the shakes because Custard Cup is right down the street...The ambiance is casual and clean--a wide variety of songs played, not too loudly. There's plenty of seating and room to spread out, although I have seen it get pretty packed. This would be a great place to come with a big group because you could easily push tables together. They give you a number so that you can sit down after ordering and wait for a server to bring your food. The food comes very quickly. They also have the world's most high tech soda machine, with a touch screen menu of more than your average options. There's a drive through as well.Obviously eating here costs more than a fast food place would, but it tastes so much better. You're not eating pink slime, chemicals, fillers, or trans-fats, and it's obvious. It's still cheaper than eating out at a \"sit-down restaurant.\" Tonight, my husband and I spent $16 for a filling meal for two and didn't have to tip anyone. When I'm in the mood for a burger at a casual place, this is where I will go.",

It's in downtown Champaign so you can do a lot of things before or after you eat. Conveniently, it's right next to a little independent movie theater!I've gone here multiple times during slow hours and busy hours. The service is consistently good and they clean your table before you're seated and give you a warm towel. During slow hours, Sushi Kame is tranquil and becomes an intimate dining experience. The food comes out fast and is a wonderful quality. I also really like the complimentary tea and vermicelli noodle dish they give you before your order comes. It's refreshing and cleanses your palate. The servers are attentive and I've never had to wait for water. Even during busy hours, they don't rush you.The sushi is fantasic and well priced. I like the spicy scallop roll, love love roll, and salmon rolls. Fresh fish that is melt in your mouth good. The rolls are artistically presented and gorgeous to look at. The chef really puts hard work into them.I had the udon on another visit and I enjoyed it. The soup is light and savory and it isn't oily at all. The udon noodles had a perfect al dente texture and together, they really made my day on a cold evening. The tempura is also another recommended dish. It's perfectly fried with no grease or oil and presented in a nice manner.On holidays like Valentine's day, they are super packed so I definitely suggest making a reservation. I walked in and had to wait 15 minutes with my boyfriend until we were seated at the sushi bar. That day our server was rushing around but did a fantastic job getting orders, people, and food around. We got the bento boxes and they are huge! They offer a lot of food for a great price and I took a lot home.At the end of every meal, they give you a chocolate mint, which is a sweet finish to a marvelous meal. I definitely recommend coming here for your Japanese food craving!",

Unfortunately, it sells out very fast and they don't always have it made - so I always make sure to call beforehand to make sure its in stock. Several times, they told me that they did and when I arrived, I learned that they had lied. So be careful.Their sushi is pretty decent quality, but nothing extraordinary. Its a bit on the expensive side and the rolls are somewhat bland, but if you know how to order correctly, you can get a great meal. I'd suggest getting either the Love Love Roll or the Vienna Roll, which comes with miso soup and a small cucumber salad. Then I usually get a house salad (it comes with a very good ginger sauce) and a side of golden rice. It comes to about $13 and leaves you filled to the brim - making Sushi Kame my favorite sushi place in Champaign.",

They start you out with a free cucumber and somen noodle salad. \u00a0It's small, but very appetizing. \u00a0I still can't figure out exactly what the dressing is, but I always drink the extra. \u00a0After that they give you a (also free) miso soup, which is pretty good as far as miso soup goes. \u00a0 \u00a0Oh, and the green tea is free and they use real matcha as far as I can tell. \u00a0It's got a really nice, light, floral taste.I've also been to Yellowfin a few times. \u00a0While Yellowfin is good, the reason that I like Sushi Kame more is probably their \"American Sushi\" combo. \u00a0For about $14, you get three pieces of salmon nigiri, three tuna nigiri, a salmon roll, and the house salad, which is lettuce with ginger dressing. \u00a0The slabs of fish on the nigiri are nicely cut and usually pretty thick, giving the sushi a rice-to-fish ratio that definitely favors the fish. \u00a0 Speaking of the fish, it has always been fresh and clean-tasting, never \"fishy.\" \u00a0Admittedly, I've only had non-midwest sushi once, so my basis for comparison is only other sushi in Illinois. \u00a0When it comes to maki, I usually stick with the simpler stuff that lets you taste the fish more, so I can't offer much of an opinion on the super tempura fried california rolls or whatever. \u00a0The unagi rolls are good though.I've had the sea urchin here as well, and while it's softer than the stuff at Yellowfin, there's also more of it and it tastes really, really good.",

The Nigiri was quite good, and the sweet rice was cooked perfectly.

It was really good so I am puzzled why they do not put it on the menu at some point. Their teriyaki glaze is quite good: not too salty but not too sweet. I also like the cut-up vegetables they put alongside it. The yakisoba is great too with a little more noodle than veggie and/or meat. The sushi, while I chose the tame Tuna roll, was very tasty and well wrapped. It tasted fresh and I felt like I did not have to pay an arm and a leg like I would elsewhere. The miso soup was also likeable and that is a big compliment from me because usually I am not a big fan of miso.Anyway, give this place a try.

Fish were all poorly sliced, they even left 2 MUSHY chunks of the back end of the tuna with a trailing white dribble of tendon, DISGRACEFUL, all fish lacked flavor or seemed as if they were sitting under a plastic cover too long since they all had this strange empty taste and smell to it... that white tuna I wrote about before? this time it was a bit icy, with poor texture and no taste. then comes the ginger, which has gone bad and made most of the dish smell like a dirty rag. Perhaps all the customers during the school year makes it so they don't have to care as much about quality? Some fish also seemed precut and must have sat on the plate too long. NO no no.Maki - insignificant.Spider roll, non spicey - about half of the amount of crab that should be in there.Uni - sure try it if you are craving it but it's not a great representationKind and attentive service.

The bento box is huge! and it has a bit of everything... some salad, assorted tempura, rice, california rolls (that can be replaced with any of their regular rolls with a small charge). Definitely don't recommend the bento box if you just want a light dinner. Luckily, I was really hungry so it was perfect for me! I ordered the Tonkatsu (Deep fried pork) bento box while my mom ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box. My tonkatsu bento box was really good except for the one piece of ebi (shrimp) tempura. I don't know how to describe but it just tasted really weird. I think they don't let the oil drip and dry after they deep fry the shrimp so it doesn't get nice and crispy. Instead, it was kind of soggy which was disappointed. Also their Tonkatsu sauce tasted funny. I don't know if they make their own sauce but it definitely didn't taste like traditional tonkatsu sauce. My mom's salmon teriyaki was delicious! Salmon was cooked so nicely and it came with sauteed vegetables as well. Between the salmon teriyaki and the tonkatsu, I'd definitely say the salmon was the better choice! The good thing about sushi kame was the service. Our server was really helpful and nice. She recommend the love roll to me in replacement of the california roll and what a great recommendation it was! Overall, I was very satisfied.. oh, did i mention that a bento box is only 12 dollars? All that food for 12 dollars!!!!! Amazing. Definitely will come back again soon.",

I lived in Japan for 9 weeks a couple years ago and understand the quality of food and service that you get there, but I certainly wouldn't hold restaurants in Champaign to that same standard. This is a small University town and access to fresh seafood is limited at best.Having said that, I was rather underwhelmed by Sushi Kame. The server (a middle-aged Korean lady) was very demanding and impatient. My girlfriend takes a long time to decide what she wants and when we were given the extensive menu, I knew it would be a while. So I asked the server if we could order the egg yolk sauce with rice dish side-dish while we looked at the menu. She gave me a very accusing look, as though I was committing some sort of crime, and then scampered off to put the order in.When she returned, \u00a0I attempted to order several more authentic Japanese items like [kama] toro, uni, and oyster, only to find none of these were \"in season\". We settled on a special spicy salmon roll, the green turtle roll, and several pieces of nigiri.As others have mentioned before, the egg yolk sauce with rice was really delicious. It is very rich, so you will need to share it with someone. The sushi was rather ordinary (by Champaign standards). The rolls fell apart prematurely indicating the rice did not have the right consistency/stickiness. The ginger was mild in flavor, the wasabe obviously dyed horseradish, and I swear they served regular soy sauce, not the special variety for sushi, because it was extremely salty.I can't comment on other dishes on the menu, and they may be delicious, but I'm not likely to come here again. For me the rudeness of the server coupled with the subpar sushi was enough to deter me from this restaurant.",

The entrees are relatively expensive and each of them can be shared by two people since they don't give you too much food. I thought that the fried rice was good, but the only reason it was good was due to the portentous amount of soy sauce that was blanketed over it. I also found it odd that employees were in the restaurant working on their establishment's balance sheets as well as folding napkins. Water is on my top 5 of favorite beverages and I have to say that the water here was absolutely filthy. Perhaps the worst aspect I experienced here was the server only speaking in Chinese despite knowing that there were English-speaking people at the table. He didn't address us at all and just choose to talk Chinese to the only person in the table to understand it. That was extremely rude and I was quite offended by it.",

Rainbow Garden had a nice oriental ambiance. I'm not referring to the tacky and excess Asian imageries on many walls of Asian restaurants in general. The interior space had a beautiful red wall with red/black elements and simple oriental decor complementing the space. You don't see many places like that at Asian restaurants. Enough with the wall color and such....The lunch special was a very reasonable price ranging between $5-$6. It consist of the type of meat/veg, your choice of fried or white rice, 1 egg roll, and your choice of sweet/sour soup or egg drop soup. The lunch portion is very nice and I think $5-$6 for lunch is very reasonable. However, their regular entrees after lunch might be a little pricey for a hungry, poor college kid. \u00a0My boyfriend and I have grown to have bigger appetite over the month. We shared a Mongolian lunch special with two jja jang myuns (black bean noodle with shrimp, meat, and assorted veggies) which was a little too much. The jja jang myun was very tasty and I would recommend people to try it, and they serve you pickled yellow raddish on the side. More importantly, I would highly recommend people to stop ordering delivery for once, get off their lazy butts, get out, and experience their dining service for once. :)Don't get me wrong, their delivery service is fast and good also.",

I also appreciated that they only used white meat chicken.- The eggroll is small but one of the most flavorful I've had among the Chinese restaurants in the area.- The fried rice was among the best I've had with ample vegetables and scrambled egg- The hot and sour soup needed more vinegar, but I still liked that among the Chinese restaurants I've visited for lunch, they offered soup.Rainbow Garden's ambiance also makes it a nice date spout with booths and red wood themes.

Senior year, I started going more often, to partake in the insanely cheap margaritas and filling, hearty Mexican food. \u00a0Now, whenever I visit my campus, I return to get my fill of the deliciousness.I love how incredibly inexpensive this place is. \u00a0Seriously, $16 for a 60 oz pitcher of margaritas? \u00a0WHAT? \u00a0We'll take two, thanks. \u00a0$9.50 for a big portion of fajitas with tons of delicious beans, rice, and guac? \u00a0Totes. \u00a0And if you order off the ala carte menu, you can practically pay with change from under your couch.It's actually pretty tasty too. \u00a0I looooove their tamales. \u00a0The bean burritos are pretty good too, and as soon as I bite into that familiar salsa, I melt. \u00a0They refill the chips constantly. \u00a0Portions are large and satisfying - it's pretty classic Mexican food for an American crowd, not reinventing the wheel here, but it's consistent and nostalgic. \u00a0The margaritas are always delicious, though sometimes they are stronger than others. \u00a0Service is usually very friendly and quick. \u00a0It's like memories covered in chile sauce with a side of beans and rice. \u00a0Dos Reales, I'll always love you.I bet this place gets mad crowded since they closed the Dos on University Ave. \u00a0Why on earth would they do that? \u00a0Shame. \u00a0Now you need to have a designated driver instead of being able to stumble back to Green Street after dinner.",

One disappointment though was the quesadilla that I ordered had this incredibly thick and disgusting cheese on it.

Definitely the strongest I've had in the C-U area. \u00a0They always have the 32 oz pitcher for like $9.75, which split between 2 people, is more than enough to get you both pretty wasted (or, if you're really ambitious, just drink the whole 32 oz pitcher). \u00a0So, if you order the margaritas before the food, you likely won't care enough once you get your food to hate it. \u00a0Works like a charm every time! But, If you're not 21 yet, I'd suggest going to a place with better food!Service is generally pretty good. \u00a0I've only had 1 slow waiter, which isn't the worst track record for a restaurant. \u00a0Long story short: Bad to mediocre food, amazing margaritas, decent service.",

The pork was tender and had a good flavor. The sauce was very smokey and on the spicy side..not bad but could easily overwhelm the pork.

The price was reasonable too, as their large beef brisket (which is 8 oz) was $9.50, coming with two sides of our choice. The ranch beans was awesomely cooked.If I could, I'd give them 4.5 stars, but 4 is too low for them. You ask why? Well, I was expecting it be a bit more elegant. For example there is no waiter service. You enter their store, get into the line to order, get your food (very quickly) on a tray and then will go to find a place to seat. Another reason I wanted to dropped a half star is that they didn't accept my DISCOVER card (Although I'm kind of used to it, but nevertheless a nuisance). Another thing is the pricing on their small beef brisket. They ask for $8.50 for the small one, and $9.50 for the bg one, thus they're totally urging you to eat more (Not that the meal is bad, but too much meat isn't good for your health anyway).Btw, the sandwich prices are very reasonable, with most of the sandwiches being a measly $3.99. I didn't try them, but they come in small burger buns (think MacDonald's $1 burgers size) but with meat extruding from the bun, like twice as big as the bun itself. I guess it is probably enough for a meal. \u00a0 Another good item on the menu is \"meat from the pit\", which they sell by pounds. Basically if you want to bring them home, this is the best deal. If I'm not wrong, it was $9.25 for a pound of their awesome beef brisket (the same price goes for all other BBQs as well). I'll remember this deal for my next home party!All in all, a good place to eat. I'll put it in my regular eating place list from now on.",

The bar tenders were extremely accommodating and found chargers for my friend and I (with different phones) after ours had died.I would say 5 for service, and 3 for food.",

        "review": "Came here with a party of 15 (we had a reservation). They were completely unprepared for us. We arrived at 7 and they first tried to seat us at a table for 8. They then moved us to the bar area and sat us on 4 different round high top tables. Whatever, we can make that work.We all ordered our drinks and it took over 20 minutes for them to all be delivered. Mind you, many of us just ordered water to start with as we were going to be going out afterwards. 20 minutes is just insane to wait for water!Another 20 minutes goes by and our waiter (who's name I never caught) FINALLY came to take our orders. We knew it would take awhile for our food so we all sat and chatted. Food finally started coming out and as it came out he had no idea who ordered what, so we had to figure out what was on the plate and who ordered it. My food was alright, though at first it didn't come with the potato's that I ordered. Instead of just bringing me a side, he took my entire plate back and came back with mashed potato's very haphazardly placed on the side.One of our diners didn't get their food until almost everyone had already eaten. She ordered chicken tenders...they aren't that difficult to make!So up until this point we were all a bit peeved but could deal with it.The real disaster hit when he went to give us our tickets. Out of 15 checks, only 2 of them were right. He charged a pregnant lady 2 alcoholic beverages! It's not like he just gave her the wrong ticket, she was the only one that ordered what she got! So he just had no idea who ordered what.I got my check and it had an iced tea on it that I didn't order. He took my check to take it off and I didn't get a new check for another 30 minutes. I almost walked out without paying because we were getting tired of waiting, but I'm an honest person and I wouldn't have felt right leaving without paying.FINALLY the manager came out to assist him. Why wasn't she there the entire time? I have no idea! But she was about as much help as a log. She apologized, of course. But did we get any sort of compensation? Nope. She did decide to send the person that the party was in honor of a gift card to come back. Something tells me that gift card will go unused. I know I will never return to this establishment.Why was that poor waiter left on his own with a party of 15? Why didn't ANYONE help him? I saw at least 3 or 4 waiters pass by our table and not a single one of them thought that maybe he was struggling. Now, don't get me wrong...our waiter was about as personable as a stick in the mud, but still...we couldn't help but feel sorry for him, he obviously had no support from management.Get it together, Houlihan's. If you can't handle a 15 top, don't allow them. I doubt ANY of us will ever return to your establishment. And you really put a damper on what was supposed to be a really awesome night for our bride-to-be.",

We waited 30 minutes for our food and my filet was over cooked. It had no sear marks and appeared to be oven cooked. How do you mess up a steak? The tilapia was thickly crusted with something, with little specks of what may have been almonds. I asked to have my steak redone and to their credit they obliged, agreeing it was not done correctly. As my wife picked the mystery crust off her fish, my steak was redone. The second steak appeared promising (sear marks visible), but the cook obviously did not time or let the steak rest because this time it was rare (raw). Now I enjoy med rare bloody, but not cold raw steak. We had enough. Asked for a doggy bag and may give my dog a once in a lifetime treat.",

She said she'd bring one right back, and then forgot (I watched her stand at the host stand, bored). Took 5 minutes to get one from waiter. This is the kind of thing you'd forgive as a fluke, but you watch and see table-waiting basics being flubbed all over the place. Last time, I watched *three* different customers standing up and approach a waiter stand asking to find their waiter. My service was slow, and didn't anticipate common needs (like a coffee refill at breakfast).My food came out partially cold and partially hot, which is either a kitchen timing issue or a tardy waiter who left food sitting in the window too long.Seeing as it doesn't seem to be one bad server, I'd guess this the result of poor training--which is usually a management issue.If you can survive the service, the hip/classy atmosphere has rich dark wood, orange lighting, and attractive window bays looking at Memorial Stadium on the south tip of campus.

One of my pet peeves is tough asparagus, and the stuff here was enough to make me go postal. \u00a0It was over breaded, over cooked, and the asparagus was actually chewy. \u00a0Gross. \u00a0I couldn't bite through the asparagus, so when I tried to eat it, the asparagus slid out of the breading leaving a pile of greasy panko straws on the plate. \u00a0The horseradish dipping sauce was good, but lacked zing. \u00a0At $10 for a dozen bad pieces of asparagus, this should definitely be skipped.As is usually the case with chains, the menu descriptions made the food sound divine but the taste did not live up to it. \u00a0It's not bad, mind you, it's just forgettable. \u00a0This was particularly the case with the \"mini desserts,\" which are actually full sized desserts; one is plenty for two people. \u00a0Thinking they were much smaller than they turned out to be, we got a $6 trio of pecan pie, banana cream pie, and chocolate cake. \u00a0All were very cold as if they had just been removed from a long stay in the fridge. \u00a0All were also very bland and had terrible texture. \u00a0The pies were both runny, and the chocolate cake was dry and made Hostess cupcakes look gourmet. \u00a0Like everything else, they looked fabulous, and were also very reasonably priced, but don't let that fool you. \u00a0They're really not worth it. \u00a0So overall, I give Houlihan's a resounding \"meh.\" \u00a0It's not bad, but I certainly didn't find it to be particularly good. \u00a0I'm giving three stars because the service was better than I would expect from a newer place so close to campus, and they definitely deserve credit for having such a well trained and capable staff.",

I don't drink alcohol, so I ordered lemonade ($2.50, and it was just ok - not very tangy), and a cup of their potato soup, and house salad with blue cheese (each $3.95). I can't believe they don't have light French dressing......this is criminal.I was disappointed that the server couldn't keep the salad orders straight; unfortunately, two of us ordered salads with white dressings; her's ranch, mine blue cheese (since there was no French dressing!). The other gal had to serve as 'taste tester' to determine which salad had ranch and which had blue cheese dressing.For $11.26 (plus my decent tip since I'm not usually bitchy unless the service is really really bad!)

A good selection of small plates (2-4 of these would be one meal) with very reasonable prices. A traditional selection of regular appetizers. The drink selection is great. They have pretty much everything on the menu but I dont know if they really have it behind the bar. The happy hours are very attractive. Not as much as other places but still great. We went for a dinner one evening. We were served by an apprentice waiter. She did a good job and the person over seeing her was very courteous and respectful too. They offered to correct our drink when we were not satisfied with the one we got. The beer selection is satisfying. The small plates are delicious and will leave you wanting more. But thats what they are designed to be. Delicious small portions. The sliders are tasty. The chicken is moist and tender. Great going so far.The entrees are a hit or miss. I particularly did not like my Salmon. It was tough, chewy and smelled a little. I do no like seafood when it smells of seafood. Yeah .. fresh seafood does not smell at all and feels tender yet firm when you cut it / chew. This one was definitely a miss. The grilled shrimp entree was good. The shrimp did not suffer the same fate as the salmon.Save room for desserts for sure! Good selection of individual desserts priced reasonably.Highly recommended for:happy hourssmall platesappetizersdessertsbar menuInconsistent about:entreesLooking forward to try their brunch!Watch out for:the happy hour listed on the site is no longer valid.

It's located on a nondescript strip mall on Neil, and unfortunately hard to get to without a car. \u00a0(Disclaimer: Not Korean) I have been here once, a long time ago, and twice in more recent memory. Both of these times, I have ordered the fried rice with tender beef, because it is honestly one of the best dishes of fried rice I have ever tasted. Whatever, I don't care that it probably isn't that authentic of a dish; I wish I could cook a batch of fried rice that good. There are many types of veggies cooked in with the dish, but they're mainly there for texture and flavor. It all ends up creating this fairly homogenous taste, but it doesn't matter, it's homogenous like a tub of butter pecan ice cream is homogenous; sure, there's no variation, but in the end, it still tastes really good and you're happy to eat more. \u00a0The rest of the menu is vast, containing foods that I don't know how to pronounce nor consume. Also, don't forget that they bring out six dishes of banchan, small accompaniments that go with your meal. All of this makes for a (seemingly) authentic experience that's pretty good for central Illinois. \u00a0The owner is a pretty animated guy, always staying busy at the counter, and keeping this place immaculately clean.

The pancake was okay- it tasted fine, but the seafood was bland and the pancake itself was mushy rather than crispy. The chap chae was also okay. The noodles were good, but it was very sweet and needed more vegetables. The bi bim bap is really good, and doesn't skimp on ingredients. I didn't try the stew, but it was well-received. Overall, I think it's good Korean food, but nothing spectacular.",

I always requested no egg, no meat, just vegetables. I also always place my order with the same man - who appears to be the owner or manager. The last time I went, \u00a0I decided to dine in with a friend and ordered bean curd bi bim bop. He asked me something after I said bean curd bi bim bop that I didn't quite understand. So I repeated to him, please just the bean curd, nothing else. I also pointed at the bean curd bi bim bop listing on the menu.When the food came out, I checked the dish and it had a pile of gray meat on top. I called the man over and politely said that I had ordered just bean curd. He became angry and almost shouted that I had ordered beef. I told him that I was sorry for the misunderstanding but I always order vegetarian - no meat - just bean curd. \u00a0He snatched the dish away and went to the counter where he began banging things around angrily.A minute later (obviously not enough time to re-fire a dish) a different server placed a bowl in front of me. \u00a0I searched through the food before eating and found more strips of gray meat throughout. Apparently, they had just scooped out the top of the same dish and served it to me again. I was incredibly embarrassed and disappointed. Based on the reaction I received from the manager/owner I did not expect that any further questions or complaints would be met in a productive way. We ended up paying our entire ticket (including the inedible bi bim bop) and promptly leaving to go get food somewhere else. Mistakes happen all the time, but the reaction I received at politely asking for the correct dish was abhorrent and not any way to run a restaurant. If you would like an enjoyable, pleasant meal without an irate and unreasonable staff, I would suggest going elsewhere.",

I've had an AMAZING Korean meal before and since then I've been trying to replicate that experience. No success though.So why B-Won over the 3 other Korean places on campus (4 if you count Spoon house)? Maybe it's simply because of the ambient. Even though the waiter spoke little English and wasn't able to offer any helpful recommendation, the overall ambient was much less chaotic than other Korean restaurants.

Her jaw literally dropped, and she ran away -- get this -- to bring the manager over so he could talk to me. I spent almost 10 entire minutes, completely embarrassed while my date sat across from me and tried to keep from laughing, listening to the manager and this waitress crowd around me and insist that it wouldn't taste right without the rice, I HAD to mix the rice, please mix the rice...oh. my.

Last time I had seafood pancake in New York, it was thick with crispy outer layer and FULLY loaded with identifiable seafood from shrimp to crab meat. What they serve here is a travesty. For entree, I had stir fry with baby squid and marinated steak. There were lesser tiny pieces of squid in the whole dish than all the tentacles on a baby squid. It was also the chewiest and most rubber like squid I have ever had in my life. Lucky, it was easy to pick them out since there were so few pieces. The beef was chewy as well. Like I had mentioned before, the dish was salty enough to require a side of blood pressure medication. All I can say about the service is that it was quick. A bit too quick for my liking.

To my surprised, it was more of let-down. The beef was harder to chew, the sauce that comes with the beef was rather runny or liquidy compared to the thick yummilicious one, and the soup wasn't as warm as before and got cold pretty quick. At both times someone was cooking the bulgogi for us (We just don't know how to do it.. or I guess we're just spoiled lol) and by the same person. The people were really nice though, very nice.

Some dishes needed to be cooked at the tables so that further limited the service. We had to wait 20+ minutes after sitting down before ordering.Serving sizes were generous but they were very stingy on the rice. When we asked for more, the waiter let out a large exasperated sigh before complying. Quite unprofessional. When we asked for more water, again with the exasperated sigh. So sorry for inconveniencing you! We ordered our dishes with white rice, but when our food was brought out, we got red rice instead. We told them we ordered white, but they said that they were out and red was all they had and left it at that.You have the option of having meat grilled at your table on a portable stove, which is nice, but after they brought the stove out and lit the fire and poured oil in the pan, they left for around 15 minutes. In addition to the increasingly hot oil that was sitting right in front of us, the pan was leaking oil over the open fire and the table. When this was brought up, they brushed it off saying it was okay. They never cleaned up the oil on our table.After we finished our meal, we waited quite a while for our check. Eventually, we were fed up with waiting and we got up to go get someone to bring us the check. When the check arrived, we quickly threw in our credit cards and set it to the side of the table (cards sticking out, easily visible) and proceeded to wait another 15 minutes before they came back to pick up the check.

I really didn't expect too much when I decided to give it a try for dinner, first because I've had some disappointing experiences with Korean food in the past, and second because of its weird location outside of town and tucked between the train track and a GM dealership. I got there at around 9pm (which is late for getting dinner on a weekday in Champaign), and surprisingly enough the place was quite happening (it wasn't nearly full, there were a good dozen of people or so). The interior is a little bare, but it's clean, modern and well lit. The menu selection is extensive, and while I'm by no means a connoisseur of Korean food, they seemed to offer a lot of pretty typical dishes. I ordered the stir-fried squid in spicy sauce (see picture... I love squid and will order it whenever I can, which is surprising considering I wouldn't even consider eating it just a few years ago... but I digress), and it was pretty good. The squid was just a tiny little bit too tough, and this could have been expected considering the distance to the nearest ocean(!), but it was still very good. And not to forget: this little side dishes were plentiful and delicious (again see picture), and it also came with a bowl of rice and soup... I'm happy I didn't order any appetizer, which I was considering doing upon getting there, because that plenty of food already. All of that for a very reasonable price ($10.50). Sure, this may not be the best Korean food I've had, but it was still very good, filling and relatively cheap... how much more does one really need?... \u00a04-1/2 stars.",

        "review": "Given the size of Champaign-Urbana, I was quite surprised by the number of Korean restaurants in this town. \u00a0I have had generally good experiences at each one, but B Won is by far my favorite, especially as it is the best option for more formal dinners.B Won radiates with casual elegance unlike the other Korean restaurants here, which feel more like sweaty lunch spots for strung-out college students. \u00a0The real benefit of this building's high ceilings and good ventilation is that you don't feel like you're sitting in the characteristic smoke clouds found at most Korean restaurants (delicious, delicious barbecue smoke clouds--but, smoke clouds nonetheless).The sophistication of B Won is also reflected in a menu that is both diverse and interesting. \u00a0They have all the standards, like bulgolgi, jiggae, and bibimbap, but they really separate themselves from other Korean places in the variety of noodles, soups, and casseroles they serve. \u00a0Each item in the menu is given a description of the full complement of the dish's ingredients, which can be helpful for diners unfamiliar with Korean cuisine--and reading about ingredients like bellflower root and sweet potato noodles just makes you feel like you'll be enjoying an exotic meal. \u00a0During the winter, I love to eat their soups made of beef bones, which are always filling and well-seasoned. \u00a0I also have to pay compliments to the kimchi, which really stands out among the side dishes for me. \u00a0I usually overlook the nappa kimchi in favor of other dishes that I prefer, but at B Won, the kimchi has what I would describe as a very distinctive, carbon-y (think soda fizz) sensation in the mouth.Lastly, I want to address comments from other reviewers about the behavior of the owner and wait staff. \u00a0Although I'll admit that the waiters seem a bit socially inappropriate (by American standards), my own experiences give me the impression that their actions are mainly innocuous and can be attributed to cultural differences. \u00a0My experiences aren't intended to dismiss the feelings of obvious discomfort felt by other patrons; I'm just merely trying to cast a more humorous, silly light on the situation. \u00a0One time, I went with friends and we all ordered entrees. \u00a0The waiter asked if we wanted white rice or mixed rice (a blend made of several types of rice, grains, and beans). \u00a0My friend asked, \"What's mixed rice?\" \u00a0We saw the waiter struggle for an English description: \"It's, uh...well...it's...it's...it's good. \u00a0Yeah, it's good.\" \u00a0We had a laugh and just ordered the mixed rice, given his recommendation that it was good. \u00a0Another time, we had just finished a meal and received our check, which comes with pieces of corn-flavored candy. \u00a0My friends were weirded-out by the flavor and didn't eat their candy, much to the chagrin of the waiter when he returned to our table. \u00a0He asked why they weren't eating it (rejection of food is considered pretty rude in Asian culture), but I quickly picked up the candy and said, \"You don't want it? \u00a0I'll eat it then.\" \u00a0That seemed to resolve the whole situation, as the waiter hurried back with our change and more pieces of corn candy for me.",

Yes, you may have heard it's a small restaurant with a perpetually long wait, but it's worth walking around adorable downtown Urbana for awhile before you're seated. I've also done a carry-out with several other people which only took about 25 minutes to prepare.There's a variety of BBQ sauces from mild to hot listed and detailed on the menu. My personal favorite is the Texas Sauce; it has that smoky flavor I expect out of Midwestern Barbeque. Also, you haven't really lived until you've tried the brisket sandwich.As for side dishes, my friends and I swear by the Twice Baked Potato Casserole. The sweet potato fries are irresistibly sweet and caramelized. Overall, Black Dog provides a one of a kind cuisine. Also VEGETARIANS-- there are some delicious options for you, too.",

BD has become one of my regular dinner spots, their meals hardly ever disappoint. The only drawback is the waiting, sometimes you stroll right in and get seated, other times, it's an hour wait. The wait staff is very hit or miss, I have a few favorite waiters (yup, guys) and one waitress that I think are helpful, attentive, and funny. What to eat: Appetizers: smoked chicken wings, smoked artichoke dip (AMAZING!) Meats: anything pork (seriously), smoked chicken (I MUST try their brisket)Sides: fries, beans, slaw, twice baked potato casserole (I must try their sweet potato fries)Meh: Cuban sandwich -- while it's the best one in town, I was a bit disappointed in its size and it's good, but not excellent. That said, I might give it a second try.Misses: Chicken salad (new) and their very popular corn bread (sorry, it's all of that meat in it, for some reason I just can't like it!)I was just there this past Tuesday and am already planning my return. 4/5 stars because of the long waiting, running out of food quickly (though who can blame the hoards of hungry customers?!), and the hit-or-miss wait staff-I HIGHLY recommend this place the food is excellent, the drinks are good, and the prices are very fair",

Wasn't too long of a wait for me, only about 2 couples ahead of me and the gf. Got seated at the bar and had an unfriendly waitress. She just seemed stressed and unhappy. Heard her say to another table that it was a long day, so tried not to bother her with anything. I waited until she left and asked another waitress for a different bbq sauce with my meal ha. Anyway, I ordered the rib tips since they guy next to me got it and it looked delicious. It was alright, nothing crazy. I got one of the vinegar bbq sauces first and didn't like it at all. That's when I got the Georgia one which was a lot better and thicker. The twice baked potato casserole, I think it was called, was delicious. The potato salad was meh, you could probably skip on that. The gf got the chicken salad which came with a bunch of crackers. It was a different style on chicken salad so not really sure what to compare it too. It was alright though. We also split some corn bread and that was meh too. I think it was over hyped in my mind from some of these other reviews. Over all it was alright, wasn't too expensive either and you get a pretty decent amount of food. Had to take some home since there was so much so that's always a positive. One day I'll try those burnt ends....one day....",

The catfish was nothing to write home about but with the flight of sauces that I ordered I was able to pair it up with a sauce that made it more interesting (favorite sauces were the Georgia Peach, Texas BBQ, and Carolina vinegar). I also ordered the top-shelf bourbon flight which had the best bourbon I've ever tasted, 20 year Pappy Van Winkle! The pours were large which was a pleasant surprise for a top-shelf flight, much appreciated.As far as service goes, I have never had such a welcoming, fun-loving, and informed server as I did at Black Dog.

TL;DR Quality BBQ here and easily one of the best places to eat in CU area.We signed in our group of 5 at 3:30 and were seated at 4 on a Saturday, get there early!My family are sort of BBQ fanatics, we had to try 3 different places in Memphis last time we were down, so seeing Black Dog rated highly on Yelp, we had to go when they came down to visit!Most of us had some variety of beef brisket while my grandmother also got ribs and my grandfather the chicken.We thought the brisket was tender and flavorful and not overly fatty. We tried some of the ribs too and really liked them! Very thick and meaty rather than fall-off-the bone style, which some people prefer. My grandfather said the chicken was good, but he did not like the side of cornbread that came with it. A traditional southerner, this cornbread was more muffin-style and too sweet for his preferences (I thought it was good). We also did like the twice baked casserole, French fries and sweet potato fries that were on the side, as well as the slaw that was on our sandwiches.Service was good but at the end a little slow to take our check due to a shift change, not a big deal!Now come my only 2 complaints. Complaint #1 would have to be that Black Dog is pretty stingy with their sauces. What came on the sandwiches was hardly anything, probably less than your average BBQ eater would like. We tried 3 different sauces I believe the hot peach, Texas and one other one, they all appeared to be good but I really cant provide an accurate taste test because we had so little of it! We also did not want to pay an extra $0.25 for extra, although my father did anyway because he's a sauce maniac! My other complaint is that the portion size was probably smaller than most BBQ places for the price. Our sandwiches were $9 and they came with one side which varied in size based on what we got. I had the casserole which was just a little cup, whereas my mom had a decent portion of sweet potato fries. I didn't leave hungry but I would probably get the combo or platter next time!Overall Black Dog has really great food for its location and I really like how I don't have to go to Memphis to get similar quality BBQ. It's nice to know that there is a local place that is very successful and also with great food and beer to go along with it.I'll definitely be back!",

I have truly missed out. I went there this past weekend after much hype from previous colleagues. The setting is just as you expect it.. always a wait [20-30 mins], very... barbequ-ie. You know, metal trays, easily cleanable, amazing smell, tasty beers, etc.Anyway, I heard so much about the burnt ends I had to get them. They only serve them twice a day. At least, this is what I am told. They have them when they open and they have them in the afternoon/dinner time. But once they run out, you'll have to wait til next time. :-( saddd face. Luckily, They had the burnt ends. Naturally, i ordered them. They were sooooo tender. I can't recall any other meat I've had in my LIFE as tender as these. They literally would fall apart when you picked them up. // Burnt ends - DEFINITELY get these. enough said. // Cornbread appetizer - easily the tastiest cornbread I've ever had. I think they put bacon in it? or some sort of meat. So soft and savory. It was very unique and definitely should be on your check. // Sauce flight - $2 - this is very cool for your first time but I wouldn't get it again. I wanted to try all the sauces but my favorite was the milos mustard. Also the vinegar one is great too. I forgot the name. I would get it your first time to kind of try all the sauces. // Sides - all of our sides were veryyyyy good. the FRENCH FRIES were amazing. They must be friend in pork fat. seriously, I have only had fries like that at one other place and they were fried in pure fat [or so i speculated]. Didn't get to try to sweet potato fries. The mac and cheese was good, a bit on the smaller portion.The only thing i didnt like... was the ribs. They were just a little bit to tough and didn't fall off the bone like i expected. I would opted out of these. But honestly, the burnt ends were so good that it didn't even matter what else I had.If you are every traveling through the champaign-urbana area... STOP AT THIS PLACE.

The food here is fantastic and I recommend waiting out the long line to eat. It's well worth it. I highly recommend the Texas caviar as an appetizer. If I didn't care about my waistline I would order it every time. The burnt ends are good - there's a reason they sell out like crazy - but I don't think they're the best value for your money. I usually get the hot polish and brisket with the twice baked potato casserole and baked beans. The fries are also great, but I LOVE the potato casserole. You're missing out if you don't get it. My boyfriend loves the rib tips. I think they're the best value for your money, but I get annoyed putting that much effort into eating ;-)The sweet tea isn't great. I wouldn't order it if you're looking for legit sweet tea. The Carolina red sauce is my favorite. Black Dog switched their default sauce from that to the Lexington something other. Not sure why because I think the new default sauce isn't great at all. The Georgia peach is also good, but of you don't like sweet sauce stick with the Carolina. I will definitely miss Black Dog after leaving Champaign.",

I've been a \u00a0\"peskaterian/vegetarian\" for over 4 years but upon a recent trip down south decided to indulge in some good ol' southern BBQ, and well... I'm a little lax in the meat eating department now. At least when it comes quality, well cooked, BBQ. You wont see me scarfing down a McRib, or eating meat anywhere else for that matter but give me some Black Dog pulled pork and I'll make an exception. You walk in and write your name and party number on the sheet. I've been here twice now and it was spot on both times. You'll have to wait a little unless you get take out but it's worth it.They have different specials each night and tend to run out of stuff so go early if you have your heart set on the burnt ends (I've yet to try them because they were sold out both times). \u00a0First time I got the 1/2 rack of ribs with mac & cheese, and coleslaw.Second time they only had 1/4 rack of ribs so I got the pick two with the pulled pork, coleslaw, and baked beans. Pulled pork was amazing! Tender and smokey, and full of flavor. That will be my go to order now. Mac and cheese is indulgent and delicious, coleslaw is of the vinegar (not creamy) variety which I love. Baked beans (they call them something else) were good, but too heavy for me personally. I'd eat them again though. The ribs were my favorite until I tried the pulled pork. They're still a close second.I could be a good vegetarian and the get the portabello sandwich with fresh chevre and roasted red pepper that sounds amazing, and maybe I will one day when my conscience overcomes me.

Additionally they had a good handful of on-tap options covering a variety of beer types. The bartender wasn't the warm and fuzzytype, however he was very prompt, attentive, and professional. I opted for the combo of two; 1/4 rack of ribs and beef brisket. For sides, corn bread and twice baked mashed potatoes. I'll have to say each were very flavorful with thee own unique taste. These both are definitely someone's home receipe and I approve. The cornbread itself is hearty and flavorful enough to TRUELY qualify as a side.Overall this is a great place without the steep price you generally run accross in a BBQ joint (that's including the bourbons).

I never bothered to review Black Dog on Yelp because, frankly, what is there to add to the veritable torrent of 5-star reviews here.Last week, though, I had occasion to travel to Kansas City (the self-proclaimed BBQ capital of the world) and made every effort to take in the best the city had to offer (a set of restaurants that naturally varies greatly depending on the Kansas City resident being asked). I had ribs and brisket at Oklahoma Joe's (in the gas station); ribs and burnt ends at Arthur Bryant's; and ribs and a burnt end sandwich at Q39. All were good, some even great (Q39 especially), but--and here is the point of my review--I found myself thinking constantly of Black Dog even as I was downing these admittedly famous and stellar BBQ items.Black Dog, in my mind, is really unmatched in its ability to offer outstanding BBQ at all times of the day and across the entire menu. From the ribs and burnt ends to the pulled pork, pulled rib sandwich, pulled chicken, and brisket, everything is truly wonderful. The sides, too--from the twice-baked potato to the pit beans--are excellent.I will admit that Kansas City's Q39 beat Black Dog in one area: ribs. The ribs at Q39 were quite simply the best I've ever had. But, even at Q39, I found myself wishing for every other aspect of Black Dog: the sides (which were sorely lacking everywhere in Kansas City), the price, and the other BBQ items. Writing this is the only way I could think of to add something new to the many compliments and superlatives about Black Dog on Yelp. So yes: even after a BBQ journey to KC, I remain steadfast in my belief that Black Dog is, hands down, the best BBQ restaurant out there. It doesn't get caught up in or weighed down by tradition or legacy. Instead, it has every aspect of BBQ honed to perfection and is clearly the result of careful planning by the owners, taking as they must have the best elements of BBQ throughout the U.S. and putting them together under the moniker Black Dog Smoke and Ale House.",

I haven't tried them all, but I haven't found one I like.The side dishes are quite good though, namely the cornbread, beans (so smoky and delicious) and sweet potato fries. This place is small and always packed, so be prepared to get there when it first opens or during non-peak times (or just be prepared to wait, in other words, stand against the wall and watch others eat three feet in front of you).",

Its welcoming and knowledgeable staff will serve you a rotating cast of beers and a stable of meats and sauces that rivals anywhere you've ever been. The burnt ends are probably considered to be the specialty here, and they're typically out of them by 1 or 2 due to the popularity, but the true specialty is just outstanding, mouthwatering food. Aside from the everyday options of pulled pork, brisket, ribs and catfish, they also have great daily specials, such as pork tacos on Tuesday and an incredible cuban sandwich on Wednesday. And not to be forgotten, the sides and appetizers are killer as well.The long wait at usual dinner and lunch hours is well documented, but there is a wait because everyone who's heard of the place dreams of eating all of their meals there, all of the time.If you're stopping in for the first time, you'll never go wrong with a cornbread appetizer, sides of pit beans and twice baked potato casserole, and pulled pork with the georgia peach sauce.",

If you can get lucky enough to wait inside during a hot summer day... You're already doing pretty well. So you finally have a table. Grab a menu and order the burnt ends sandwich... I've never had anything like this before. I've had a lot of bbq coming from the south and living here the majority of my life. But the beef brisket here is amazing. It's more tender than any other beef brisket... drool... order it with the Carolina Red sauce. So good. Soooo good. The sweet potato fries are also good too. Corn bread... mmmm. The only thing that I could have done without is the slaw. Meh... I've had much better slaw, but in the sandwich is good. It compliments the rest of the flavors. Can we get back to that beef brisket? The end... get the burnt ends sandwich. That is all...",

I wish Black Dog had outdoor seating like Bunny Tavern, but onto the BBQ!One would just assume when dining with a former beauty pageant queen that I would have to practice proper manners and not eat with my hands. I will divulge on this a little later, but keep this in mind!I arrived about 12:15 and I knew there be a wait......about 15 minutes! It was perfect because my friend Elsie, the aforementioned former beauty queen and fellow PE teacher was across town.It was like clockwork! She showed up and we were seated! NICE!Rather than be overwhelmed by all the options of barbecue Nirvana, I did my research via Yelp and Noshfolio. I knew I was getting a combo with 2 sides and two different barbecue sauces. \u00a0I made a fantastic choice with the smoked chicken and the pulled pork! I got some salad and beans, but the highlight of the meal was the chicken FALLING off the bone. Falling, like Fall Out Boy or the season after summer...FALL! Remember when I said that it was falling off the bone? One might ask, \"How do you know if you were eating with a knife and fork?\" I will mention that the chicken came with a thigh that was very difficult to eat with a knife and fork! At this point, Elsie reminded me that she grew up in a family when they had dinner, they sat down and spoke with their mouths full!I started to eat like a savage caveman who hadn't eaten since the wooly mammoth he killed three weeks ago. Elsie ordered their pulled pork sandwich, famous cornbread, and twice baked potato casserole. She couldn't finish and got a to go box.I went with the Texas and the Chipotle sauces. I didn't know the difference, and it didn't help when our waiter didn't tell me which was which! I asked and was glad I did because I had them mixed up! I also wanted to buy a medium t shirt to represent Black Dog in Paxton, but to no avail, they only had larges!I would have given 4.3333333 stars if I could. Assessment is huge as a teacher, but I just can't \"round up\" because of the service! I will be back to try some of their smoked shrimp (Thursdays), fish tacos (Friday), or late night menu!

Expect to wait about 20-30 minutes maybe longer for bigger groups. The place can seem a bit cramped when the line is long, so try to get a table that isn't next to the door. While you wait, try one of their rotating craft beers. They have a huge selection, as well as, a full-service bar. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the staff are all incredibly friendly and attentive. It seems like a family-run place because of the comforting ambience it alludes. I've heard the Burnt Ends are where it's at, but they go fast! They start serving them at 11am and 5pm so try and get there right at those times. I haven't had the chance to try them yet, as I've always arrived too late (probably my fault, always taking too long to get ready). I have ordered the Beef Brisket Sandwich both times I went to Black Dog and haven't been disappointed yet. I have tried a few different sauces with the brisket and loved them all. My favorite is the house-speciality sauce. The bun it is served on is also super soft. The cornbread is amazing, especially with a little bit of butter. And the twice-baked potato casserole is to die for! It is my favorite appetizer on the menu. The applesauce is also deliciously sweet and you can tell it is homemade.

Black dog holds up just fine, but doesn't shine.Meat: The pulled pork is probably a 4/5 on its own. It has a deep smokey flavor and great texture - not thin and strandy like some other pulled pork can be - it comes in big hearty strips. The ribs, on the other hand, were just a 3/5 for me: they had decent flavor and a small smoke ring, but the texture was off. It took a good amount of work to pull the meat off the bone and was more chewy rather than tender. The sauce is mediocre; good heat but heavy on the tomato and not a lot of depth.Sides: mashed potatoes are creamy and satisfying, but the fries were limp and dry. I wouldn't get them again.Something about this place just doesn't sit right with the BBQ snob in me. The fact that I would come here and get the pulled pork is telling, I think - it's good, but it is one of the easier cuts of meat to make. Ribs are much harder to get right, and that lack of ability shows through at Black Dog. The biggest reveal? I found that I was uninterested in eating the leftovers later...that rounds Black Dog down to 3 stars for me.",

Everything I've ordered has been good, but my go-to is the 2-meat combo platter, which comes with 2 sides and is a great value for the amount of food you get (I always leave feeling stuffed, and I can eat a lot). If you're into catfish, try the catfish with mustard sauce; I never get tired of it. When they have them, the beef ribs are fantastic. There is a good variety of beers on tap, and the selection is constantly changing; there is usually something for everyone. I've found their cocktails to be overly-sweet, but to be fair I've only tried a few. As everyone has mentioned, lines can be long, but the wait is worth it, especially in the summer when it's not painful to stand outside. The only bad experience I've had with waitstaff was once when a friend was asked how his beer was and he said it wasn't what he expected and then got interrogated rather uncomfortably by the waiter about what he meant. Usually everyone is fairly pleasant, even when the restaurant is packed and hectic. As others have also mentioned, if you want burnt ends go early!",

In fact the burnt ends were remarkably not dry. Lots of smoky flavor, so good. In my opinion, what makes really good bbq is some attention to sides, and these absolutely did not dissapoint. Slaw was crispy, fresh and savory. Good balance of flavors and not too sweet or creamy. Beans were equally well done, really savory and again seemingly devoid of the too much sugar syndrome of extremely mediocre bbq joints. This place is soooo not a mediocre joint, cant wait to get a chance to go back!to",

And to top it off, seasonal, local specials (I once had the smoked beet salad, which was glorious).Take my word for it, the wait isn't that bad.

Well, I suppose it's not so hidden since there is usually a long wait. But don't be discouraged! The wait is well worth it, I promise. Try to make your way through the door, find the guy in charge, and put your name on the list. There's not much space in this place. I guess that would be my one complaint. It can get pretty crunched, especially if you're waiting. However, what is better to tide you over than a delicious beer? Now, let's talk about this beer.They have new selections on tap all the time. Please, do your beer pallet a favor and don't order the usual domestics and imports (Miller, Bud, Heiniken, Corona, etc). Those are just fine for any regular restaurant. Why miss the glorious opportunity to try something mind-blowingly good? Seriously, these beers are amazing. They come from different breweries across the country. Places/companies you've never heard of. Combinations of flavors you would never think to try. I once had an oyster beer here. Sounds disgusting but it was so good. Trust me on that. I'm very picky and I liked it. You can also get a flight of 7 beers on a dogbone shaped tray (how fitting!). This flight has all the beers that are on tap in 4 oz glasses. You can share them with a friend and then order the one you like best!Now, on to the food. So SO good. There are a few different sauce choices you can get. Not being one for spicy, I get the Georgia Peach. It is soo good on anything you get. There is no bad item on this menu. The pulled pork is amazing as are the hamburgers. Hard to believe a hamburger could be so good, but it is. The brisket is also amazing. They cook it for 12 hours. How could it not be? Try to get here relatively early though, because some items like the brisket run out later in the evening. While it's a bummer, think of it as a good thing. This way, you know they're not just heating it in the microwave. They cook it, and once it's gone, it's gone. Oh and the fries are amazing, whether you get the regular or sweet potato.I know this was a long review, but I really can't say enough about this place. I'm obsessed. It's a bummer that my bf graduated so we can't go all the time since we live near Chicago. However, I will make any excuse to go down. Going there this weekend for Halloween.

I might be biased since I love BBQ and, as I said, this place definitely has the best BBQ in the area. I've been coming here regularly for 3 years and I have never been disappointed.A heads up to anyone that hasn't been here before, you will probably have to wait in line. In the 3 years that I've been coming here I've only been seated without waiting in line once and that was when I came on a Tuesday in the middle of the summer before the dinner rush. The longest I've waited was 2 hours and it was still totally worth it! If you're not down for a wait, you can just call ahead and get your food to go or even make a to go order in person if you get there and decide the line is too long.The most recommended dish has to be the burnt ends, but they run out quickly. They make burnt ends twice a day (at 11:00 am and 5:00 pm, I think). I would also highly recommend the ribs and rib tips. I generally get the brisket and chicken as well, but I wouldn't say those are the most amazing dishes. They've got plenty of BBQ sauces to choose from as well. I've recently been getting the mustard, which is delicious with everything I've tried it with (brisket, chicken, ribs, rib tips, burnt ends).If you're in the area and you want great BBQ this is the only place to go.",

Tender with a deep-smoke, slow-cook flavor -- the pork is excellent (especially on the bone), the chicken is good. The quality is consistent -- good every time. I keep hearing about the amazing burnt ends, but I have not yet lucked into finding them available. They run out early and frequently.The sauces are average to below average. Sorry -- Porgy's (another local bbq joint) has much more robust and flavorful sauce (Texas style). I'm not just talking about one sauce -- I've had several (including the Georgia Peach, which a friend recommended). The sauces tend to be light on flavor and thin on substance. The sides are anywhere from excellent to okay. My favorite is the twice-baked potato casserole. Amazingly rich and delicious. A friend had the Southwestern potato salad and also loved it, except he said it was room temp rather than cold or warm. The sweet potato fries are good, but not great (they could use a dusting of curry powder or something). The pit beans have a nice meat flavor (bacon added) but also suffer from the same thin base, weak seasoning, and lack of complexity as the sauces. The coleslaw is bad. The cabbage is thick cut and bitter, the vinegar dressing nearly flavorless. I'm not a fan of NC bbq, and this reminds me of a bad side in NC (where I lived for a year).The stuffed cornbread appetizer is very good -- a wedge of dense and flavorful not-too-sweet skillet bread with some meat and extras worked in. But it too should be served warm and with butter, rather than slightly cool from the fridge.In all, if you are a meat lover willing to doctor or add your own sauce, Black Dog offers superior entre fair. The sides are kind of hit or miss -- choose what others recommend.The restaurant is in a very small space, so go early, expect to wait, or even accept getting turned away (happened to us once). Other people have told me the bar is good, but I don't drink and couldn't sit through the noise if I did. The place is usually packed and extremely loud. Just standing at the counter waiting to pay, I felt like my head was being banged on a gong. I also had to navigate a small, packed entryway going both in and out -- that may not seem like much, but it's tough on us quiet types. The good news is Black Dog offers a full carryout menu and accepts all credit cards except American Express. They do a good job of packing up the food to go, too.",

Of course, that's leaving out any one of the awesome burgers, the half chicken,ribs, and their awesome sides (pit beans or sweet potato fries for me...but regular fries, southwestern potato salad, twice baked casserole, and smoked sweet potato w/ brown sugar and butter...all ridiculously awesome).The red cabbage cole slaw, and any number of their homemade sauces (my favorite being the hot georgia peach) are outstanding compliments to the meat. and they're conscientious too. a few small price hikes to support grass fed, local beef, and the delightful free-range chicken. they even recycle, which I assure you most of the restaurants in town do not. Oh, and don't glaze over when you hear the specials. Burritos for lunch are insane, and don't get me started on the beef ribs. Slightly more labor intensive than the pork ribs (at risk of being redundant, also excellent), but a serious treat. Almost forgot to mention their amazing beverage selection. Not only is their beer selection fantastic (with the option for an affordable flight of craft beers), they have 1) an awesome whiskey selection 2) awesome bottled soft drinks...mexican coke and squirt (with sugar, not corn syrup), and a couple other tasty options. Alright, this post is getting annoyingly long. But this place is just too good. They deliver you an amazing product while being environmentally conscientious, and just overall nice guys. Lastly, I also might clarify a couple things that people have commented on, but are inaccurate.The platter vs. the sandwichplatter is twice the meat of a sandwich (in the case of brisket, pork, or ends), with two sides, and no bun. so it's not \"basically the same thing,\" it's twice as much of everything, without a bun.the beans don't come out of a microwave, they are smoked and then kept in a hotbox, which is very much not a microwave. plastic might still melt, but it didn't happen in a microwave.That is all.",

If you tend to go out to restaurants like, say, Chili's or Friday's, where the servers are obligated to be saccharine to the point of nausea, then hey! you probably won't like The Black Dog's atmosphere because you'll think the servers, host or bartenders are rude for not falling all over themselves to do your bidding. I personally love the Black Dog, primarily for the food. If I had one complaint about the place it would be that it gets pretty cramped. Probably once a week I entertain the notion of going to eat here and have to decide against it because of how ridiculously busy it is. I know The Black Dog isn't hurting for business and I might even be doing them a favor by not going to dine with them on their busier evenings, but GOD, I love them so much.

I was really excited before the first visit because of all the great reviews on Yelp, and I ended up being sadly disappointed in my dry beef brisket sandwich and slightly metallic-tasting pit beans (although being that I don't often come across foods that taste of metal, I wrote it off as a problem with my mouth that evening). This experience really struck me deeply...I'd never had an eating experience that contradicted so sharply with a Yelp consensus. Was something wrong with me? I began to feel quite gastronomically insecure.I gave it a second try recently, opting for a plate of rib tips along with an order of potato salad and corn on the cob. Again, a sunken heart. About half of the rib tips were great, while the other half were terribly dry and tough; I had to force myself to finish them. As for the sides, the corn on the cob was mushy and bland, but the spicy potato salad was pretty enjoyable. We threw a sampler beer flight into the mix, which was probably the best part of the meal (and a good value to boot, being that you net out at more beer for less money than most of the single glasses). I'm sorry to say that Black Dog is oh-for-two. Maybe I just had bad luck in picking the worst items on the menu or coming in on bad days, but now that I'm no longer living in the area (this was my last dinner in Chambana), it unfortunately may never have an opportunity to redeem itself again with me.

Went on a Thursday night, and was ushered in to two seats at the end of the bar by the hostess. The bartender/server was nice and was around enough to take our order, and the service was very efficient, almost too efficient. I certainly felt rushed to order, eat my food, pay my bill, and leave so the people waiting could eat. I've been to much busier BBQ places like Oklahoma Joes in Kansas City that operates a similar size joint \u00a0out of a gas station and it's all self seating, and although most people won't sit there all day while others wait, they don't hurry you out after you've waiting your turn in line. I probably still had half my food on my plate when I was asked \"are you all done with that?\"... seriously? As for the food, I ordered the cornbread appetizer, and the pork inside was a interesting touch, which I liked. Before we could finish our cornbread the food was already served. I got the pulled pork/brisket combo with twice baked casserole and slaw. The sides were pretty good, though my GF's potato salad had zero flavor. The meat was nothing special. Yes, it was tender, but the pulled pork almost looked roasted rather than smoked, and having an ice cream scoop shaped pork was kinda odd. \u00a0The house sauce was what really killed it for me. I really couldn't put my finger on what I don't like about it but the sweet, smoky, kick it has just doesn't do anything for me but overpower the flavor of the meat. And like everyone else says, the place is packed and cramped all the time. If this place is so great then they should give the customer a good overall dining experience and not just rely on their food.

The brisket was perfect as was the smoked Polish. My dad loved his catfish, too. What really made the meal was our server Matthis (spelling? Sorry if it's wrong). He was funny, friendly and fast. Our drinks were never empty and he seemed to really care that we were happy. I wish it wasn't always so busy. I guess it's because the food is so delicious. Like I said though, it's worth the wait. Thanks to everyone there for a great lunch!",

Third problem, I like the food but I don't love it and I can certainly go without the unneeded crap from the bartender not to mention the attitude from a waitress that we are the best.

I LOVE the cornbread with chilis and pulled pork in it, but it's not for everyone. Their BBQ sauces are awesome! I could eat a shoe if it was dipped in some Hot Georgia Peach. Their smoked turkey is amazing - which surprised me because I hate turkey but had to try it when I was drooling over someone else's meal. I've tried most proteins on the menu and sandwiches - I've never been let down. Only once have a thought the meat was a little skimpy, but it's not like I left hungry.

We saw people in booths and tables with food and drinks, waited on by a woman, and at least two people standing around behind the bar. They were not busy.Finally tiring of this exercise we seated ourselves at the bar uninvited. The bartender came by and told us they were basically out of food. No ribs, no pulled pork, no chicken, nothing.I can understand their under-estimating demand given that they haven't been open that long. (Although, if you start serving ribs at 5pm, you only have something like 5 booths and 4 tables, and you're out by 8pm -- huh?)But if someone had told us there were out when we came in, it wouldn't be a problem. Letting customers just stand around stupidly is ridiculous. I'm sorry, no food is so good to suffer so much attitude. I felt like I was in a snooty restaurant in Paris.No thanks.

You lucky UIUC kids, I'm jealous!Last September, I went to Black Dog for the first time on a double date. We had a 40-minute wait but time flew by in their awesome draft beer selection. They ran out of the famous burnt ends (meat cut from the point half of a smoked brisket) by the time we sat down, but everything else was delicious so I promised myself to go back. And I did, 3 times! It has become a tradition for my boyfriend and me. The quality of their food and beer is amazingly consistent.The burnt ends turned out to be perfectly charred, moist and smokey. On top of that, their hot polish and chicken are just mind blowing. I never pick chicken over beef/pork at bbq places, until I reached my fork into my friend's Black Dog chicken platter :P But tonight, we got another surprise...Smoke Duck Special, which has now made Thursday night the best night! Both the duck and the chicken are worth trying. They not too greasy and deliciously spiced.Last but not least, I have fallen in love with their sides and bbq sauces. You can't go wrong with the sweet potato fries and the vinegar based slaw, also, the cornbread has BRISKET in it! I know the bbq sauce variety does not help your decision making.

YIKES. \u00a0 I would stick with the sandwiches for $6.95 with one side. \u00a0A platter is $11.95 -- basically the same thing (minus the bun) + two sides. \u00a0 The price jump from a sandwich to a platter doesn't seem worth it to me.Those are my two issues. \u00a0We eat here at least once a week and I LOVE the pulled pork sandwich, the Cuban sandwich, and the burnt end sandwich (although the last couple times I had it, it was dry). \u00a0My side of choice is either the potato salad (to die for!) or a side salad (all local,fresh vegetables....so refreshing!!!).UPDATE: \u00a0they now have highchairs! \u00a0The kind that attach to the table. \u00a0We actually bought a Phil and Ted portable high chair to specifically bring with us to BD, but they beat us to it.... \u00a0So now i only have the one issue about their prices. \u00a0BTW -- their smoked chicken is WONDERFUL as well as their pit beans. \u00a0 If you're wondering what to feed your 10 month old baby, try little bits of chicken, pulled pork, the sweet potato and some beans!",

They arrived too hot to touch and glazed in the house standard Carolina BBQ sauce. They were great. Then we shared two combination platters which included brisket, sausage, pulled pork, ribs, twice baked potatoes, slaw, pit beans and sweet potato fries. We had a flight of BBQ sauces which included Carolina, Texas Georgia peach hot and mild, chipotle, Milo's mustard and a vinegar. Get the flight. The diversity of the sauces is half the fun.Keep in mind that you are in a college town and the atmosphere is busy, bustling and full of college kids. I enjoyed it, and actually prefer it over a faux-texan theme with a bunch of cowboy junk on the walls.Great beer selection also. I'll be back next time I'm in Urbana.",

The sauce was very good- definitely homemade, not the HFCS stuff from the bottle. It's not as sweet as the thick and dark styles, but its delicious, with a bit of heat. The slaw is is vinegar, not mayo-based and mine was fresh and crisp. The cornbread was delicious- the description says it has chilies, beans, and meat in it, and I was imagining something with big chunks or almost like a baked sandwich- when it arrived it looked like a piece of thick cornbread, but when you bit into it the flavor was salty and smoky with just a hint of chile flavor- no discernible pieces of beans/meat. The potato salad was good, but not the best I've had. The baked beans were delicious, with a definite smokiness, NOT the sweet stuff you're used to from pot lucks or the can!Delicious BBQ!",

I was hassled because 5 out of 6 of us where there. I understand if 1 person is holding a table down for 6 but 5/6? C'mon. Also, servers have been cold, short, and gruff with my tables. On the whole, the staff comes off very pretentious.HOW TO FIX: right now you are walk in, consider a reservation system; expand your seating area/kitchen to accommodate more customers; ask your staff to be friendly (not many of them smile, honestly!) and understanding (especially in situations like the ones I described); try and give off the vibe that you appreciate our town in which you have been so successful.STAY or GO: I wouldn't pick Black Dog for a meal but I would go if someone else wanted to.",

South Carolina burger, which has the same Carolina sauce as the burnt ends and comes with barbecue pork on top (no, it is not good for your cholestorol, but it it is totally worth it). Barbecue salmon (available as a special certain days) that seems strange in concept but basically melts into the barbecue sauce, and is (I assume) the healthiest option you'll come across. Also, the buns are weirdly good? I don't understand, but I appreciate it.Drinks: Go with a craft beer or whiskey list -- the options are many. I love the beer flights, as well.Sides: The cornbread is out of control. It comes with small bits of barbecue pork baked in. Also, it is the size of a piece of pie, so consider splitting. I would get a side of carolina sauces to dip in, it is amazing. Also, the baked beans are flavorful and made me like baked beans. Not as crazy about: The wait time, because it's a small space and the best casual dining in town. I would consider going at opening or in the mid-day lull. But I think they're opening a new location. Also, not a huge fan of the brisket (which is cool, because everything else is life changing).",

The bar is a great place to sit so don't count it out.The beer selection is excellent and I highly recommend the flight if you have some time (and a DD).

I am originally from L.A and an almuni of the U of I, and in my 4 years in the area, this place consistently serves up the best meals. Whenever I go back down to school, I always make sure I go to Black Dog.Logistics: They won't seat you until your full party is there, and make sure you arrive on the earlier side of whatever meal you plan on going to (5,5:30pm is a good bet for dinner, 11am or so for lunch). The waiting area inside is very small, but there is a nice size bar and tvs.Food: Everything i've ever had from here is great. A go-to is always the combos, and obviously the BURNT ENDS have to be part of whatever creation you make. The ribs, pulled pork, brisket, rib tips, and all of the sandwiches and specials i've tried are delicious. There are some excellent sauces- Hot Georgia Peach and Carlina Red are my 2 favorites. As for sides, the thing to order is baked potato casserole- that alone might be the single best dish on my plate. They have specials all of the time and new dishes that are creative and unique.Beer: Always some local, midwest brews on tap, and they change it up very frequently. The beers they offer are seasonal, the the fall/winter beers are particularly tasty. A great place to get a great meal, some good beers, and watch some games.Service: The service is as good as the food, which is remarkable considering how busy the place gets. There always seems to be 2 waiters around which doesn't seem like much and really isn't- and they do run around, but the service is always fast, pleasant, and attentive.

The chicken has always been incredibly moist, and the peach BBQ is a perfect compliment. Absolutely delicious. I've also tried the brisket, pork tacos, and burnt ends, which were amazing. The sides have also all been delicious, from the corn bread to the spicy potato salad.In addition to the food, the selection of beer on tap is typically pretty varied and affordable. I almost always get a beer with my meal...well, when I'm not feeling too cheap, that is. ;)The only thing that hasn't been consistently good is the service.

The house BBQ sauce which came with the meal was EXCELLENT and though I have heard that they have several other options, I'm not sure there would ever be any need.Another bonus was that Black Dog had a small, but great, beer selection.

        "review": "I came in sometime around 3:30 looking to eat what became my only real meal of the day. (Raise your hand if you've been there before on a Sunday). My friend, a recent transplant to the area, suggested a \"pretty sweet BBQ place\" instead of the much closer and cheaper McDonald's near his apartment. \"Oh, and they also have their own beer.\" Sold. So, walking in, the seating space is really rather small for a pub/restaurant - and way too hungry to wait for a table - so we just sat at the bar. I Yelped this place before leaving and was told to try the Burnt Ends but to get there early to do so. Well, they were out. And they were also out of catfish. Luck of the draw of coming in late on an NFL playoff game day, I suppose. I ended up getting the rib tips with regular French fries and the Southwestern potato salad, with the Left Hand Milk Stout to drink. I mean, if I'm gonna carbo-load, why not do it in style?Anyway, our first server ended up also giving me a small sample of a blueberry ale just in case I'd be coming back or ordering more beer with my dinner. I suppose if I liked blueberries, I'd be all over this, but I'm not such a fan... however, I certainly appreciate the offer. I also ended up having the one beer of theirs they had on tap the night before at a bar, so I didn't want to double dip and ended up going with a Hennepin saison instead.The food finally came, after many delays informing my friend that supply was limited on catfish and eventually running out of it. The Carolina Red BBQ sauce is very tasty but has a hidden kick to it. With the rib tips, it was perfect. That said - though the fries were great (but maybe a bit skimpy on the serving size) and the Southwestern potato salad was good (but I was almost hoping for it to be a bit closer to room temperature), the rib tips themselves were tender and flavorful, but I thought there was a bit too much fat on them, whether marbled in or around the little bits of bone. The parts closer to the edges were fine, but towards the center were tricky. I don't want to imply that this is standard practice, but due to having to cancel both items my friend ordered, he was able to substitute something else on the menu and get comped for it on the bill. Much appreciated. However, our original server kind of disappeared for a while so we ended up being served by a guy that sort of looks like Paul McCartney around 1968, and he did a great job.",

The chicken sandwich I had was good, once the barbecue sauce was able to make its way down to the pulled chicken on the bottom of the bun. Otherwise, it was a bit dry. My boyfriend had the Carolina sandwich and he enjoyed that along with the potato salad as his side.A good selection of alcoholic beverages with not the largest selection of beers. The \"Ale House\" part of the name gave us the impression that maybe there were several selections on tap but, as I recall, there weren't a ton nor could we see the tap handles (outside of 1) to get a visual (sometimes that's nice to see).

They often have specials, which so far have also been great.There are still a few small kinks, such as only having four napkin dispensers along the entire bar that seats 15 or so people (I had to ask for napkins, which one should never need to do at a barbecue joint!

Service: 3.5 - depending on the crowd one can either get their food fairly quickly or 40 minutes later; I am a huge fan of the BBQ here but a couple of weeks ago, with a large crowd, I had to wait at least 40 mins for my Catifsh sandwich. Decor: 3 - nothing to write home about but they do have 2 large flatscreens always showing sports so its nice to sit at the bar with a good beer and food in order to enhance one's viewing experience. Food: 5 - It is hands down, the best BBQ in the area. The quality per price ratio is also top notch since the larger helpings will usually tide people over for leftovers as well as fill those who are ravenous. The beer here is really good and reflective of the overall abundance of good microbrews and international beers available in the Champaign-Urbana area.

        "review": "\"Best Food In Champaign-Urbana!\"Although there is always generally a wait, and if you want their delicious Burnt Ends you have to come early in the evening, Black Dog is well worth it. Nearly everything you order at Black Dog is excellent. The southern-style smoky greatness of their BBQ and sides is mouth watering. Black Dog offers a great list of whiskeys and also serves many good micro-brews. Burnt Ends and Spare Ribs are extremely good, as is their side order of Smoky Pit Beans. Occasionally I'll order a Carolina Burger, which is a burger with pull pork on top, when I want to mix things up. Many people rave about their corn bread, as it is also delicious. Daily specials help keep the mix of food fresh, however I could never grow tired of Black Dog. Recently the restaurant started serving special Late Night items after 10:30pm that features special cocktails and menu items (like Gourmet Hot Dogs/Sausages) that you cannot order during regular hours, which are great as well. Try Black Dog, you won't regret it, but you might just feel frustrated thinking about the soonest time you can come back for more. Note: When choosing a sauce, Hot Georgia Peach is the way to go. (But hell, you can order a Flight of Sauces and try them all for yourself. Enjoy!)",

However my one biggest complaint is the wait. every time i've came here it's been an hour wait. The burnt ends are usually gone long before dinner. In fact, i got laughed at once when I came in at 9pm asking for burnt ends. It's good that it's opened till 11pm which is an hour more than most restaurants on campus. However, considering the amount you pay, I would rather go to lil porgy's.. better bang for my buck and their rib tips are ah mazing for less than $6.",

We had heard so many good things about it that we finally decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed.We were aware that the biggest drawback would be the wait for a table, so we left home early to get there right before it opened. Several other people had the same idea. We were given a nice greeting upon entering and were seated immediately. We were told that we might have a bit of a wait for service since we were seated before the place opened, but our waitress came by right away. We decided to start the meal with the appetizer we were most curious about: the burnt ends. Although a tad pricy, the meat lived up to everything we had read -- flavorful, wonderfully chewy around the edges, with melt-in-your mouth smoky goodness.For our lunch, we both had pulled pork sandwiches, sweet potato fries, and an additional side of twice baked potato casserole. The sandwiches were excellent -- wonderfull smokey meat, slaw, and excellent Carolina Red barbeque sauce. The sweet potato french fries actually tasted like sweet potatoes, but I am not sure why others have raved about them. They were just okay, as was the casserole. But ... we came to this place looking for excellent barbecue, and it delivered!We were happy we decided to eat right when the place opened because a line formed as we were eating our lunch. We decided to make a quick exit so that someone else could get our table. We were in and out in about 35 minutes.Would we come here again? Definitely! Next time I would like to try the Georgia Peach barbeque sauce and sample the chicken and catfish. I decided to only go with four stars because the sides were only average in our estimation. Next time we will try some others.",

The burnt ends are basically legendary. I had never been there early enough to try them until yesterday. Yeah, they're amazing. It's no wonder they sell out before 12:45 pretty much every day. The barbecue is divine, the sauces fiery, the fries crispy, and the beer cold - and all for a terrific price (and friendly service!). Lunch for two with one appetizer, one sandwich, one platter, one soft drink and one beer - $32 before tip, and there were even some leftovers to take home. The only downside I can see, other than the occasional out-of-stock menu item, is the seating issue. There's definitely not enough space. However, they do make it fantastically easy to get a meal to-go, plus some relaxing outdoor seating for the warmer months. If you come with a group, make sure everyone is there on time, or you'll be waiting until the last person arrives, and then some. Still - it's worth the wait.",

I love that you get to pick from a variety of sauces, which are all great; ask your server for a recommendation if you can't choose.

The places in these towns are like institutions, with heritage and loyalty passed down from one generation to the next. People are on a first-name basis with the cutter and pit man.My all-time favorite: Franklin BBQ, which was recently named best bbq in America by Bon Appetit. It's also gotten rave reviews from the NY Times, Food and Wine, and the only perfect rating from fcg-bbq, a bbq joint blog with its nose seriously to the ground, and whose opinion I take to be more authoritative than any national magazine.I know BBQ is more than what Texans call 'brisket', but when done right, brisket is so good that it's hard to see what else one could want from BBQ.If you're looking for what Texans call ' wet brisket' or 'moist brisket', here's how to get the most out of Black Dog: go from Sunday to Thursday when the pit man Jay is working. The wet brisket ( or what people around here call 'burnt ends') is best in the evenings.Order a burnt ends platter, and ASK YOUR SERVER TO NOT TRIM ANY FAT. Tell him or her that you want about a 50-50 meat/fat ratio with plenty of the fat webbing between the little nodules of meat.Ask for sauce only on the side. Ideally, you won't be needing any.Make sure to ask for white onions, because they default to red. And pickles. And try to get some white bread.If it's at all dry or tough, talk to your server and send it back.Jay will know what you're looking for. He has been to Texas. He will speak your language.",

I would like to say first and foremost that I have been in the restaurant/bar industry for around 6 years and I know what it is like to work in a busy environment...though there was a wait, it was NOT busy enough to provide THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.We arrived and the hostess (a gentleman) greeted us with a face of annoyance. I saw an extra chair at the bar and asked if we could pull up an extra one and sit there. With annoyance he answered with \"Not right now.\" We were never told that the bar was also a part of the seating wait. We asked how long the wait was and received yet another look of annoyance stating there were sixteen tables waiting ahead of us with no time frame. I really wanted to try the food so we decided to take it to go. By this time I was upset considering, like i previously mentioned, I work in the industry and know how to give customer service to build rapport. I asked the guy taking our order if the hostess was the owner and he informed me that the hostess wasn't but he in fact was the owner, omitting to ask if there was something he could do for us. I did not mention what horrible service we were receiving because I like to be more professional but while we were waiting for our food we over heard two other customers become disappointed at the responses they were receiving from the hostess.

I usually order the pulled pork and the brisket, although I occasionally will get a hot link. For sides, the twice baked potatoes and pit beans are probably my favorites, with honorable mention going to the sweet potato fries.I also have tried the burritos (only served at lunch time) and they were excellent.I live in Chicago now (after living in Urbana for about 6.5 years), and I have been unable to find a BBQ place in Chicago that even comes close to Black Dog. This came as a huge surprise to me since I just assumed somewhere in Chicago there'd be something this good, but it has just been a series of disappointments. When I want BBQ, what I really want is Black Dog.I recently went down to visit Urbana, partially for an excuse to eat here. The beer selection at Black Dog is also phenomenal. I discovered several relatively obscure beers I had never heard that have since become regular favorites. (New Holland Dragons Milk being one of them). I think Black Dog has a more interesting beer selection than the Blind Pig some of the time.Be prepared to wait a while, but the wait is worth it. They might want to consider expanding to a larger location, one always worries about that since it might mess with success. I think they could probably sustain it though considering this is almost a regional draw.",

I've had brisket at other places and it's dry or fatty or lacking in flavor. Not Black Dog. I've never had bad brisket here. I've never had bad ANYTHING here.The sides are just stunning. \u00a0I had a recurring problem with underdone smoked sweet potatoes but no one else had this problem. I must be cursed. When they're fully done, they're delicious, just check them before you leave if you get takeout. \u00a0The fries and sweet potato fries are crisp and delicious. In about 20 orders, we've never had soggy or greasy fries. \u00a0The potato casserole is okay but it's a bit bland. \u00a0Their homemade smoked bleu cheese dressing \u00a0is also fabulous. \u00a0And I'd consider composing an ode to their cornbread.They also did theme nights, where they'd put on special dinners. \u00a0There was a night with local meats from Triple S Farms, a beer night, and a Thanksgiving dinner. \u00a0All delicious.

Correctly reviewed, there was a wait at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening. We signed in on the board as soon as we arrived (again, thanks to a review) - good to know this or we would have been standing around outside in the brisk weather until we happened to figure it out. We waited about a half hour and were seated at the bar. Service was okay, not stellar. So we ordered the \"burnt ends\". I'm not sure what we should have expected, but two fatty slices of brisket were not to my liking. If you like fatty prime rib, then you will be in heaven. The rib tips had a good flavor, were a bit on the tough side for me, hubby enjoys chewing so he didn't mind them. The sauces were just okay, hubby didn't like any we tried and we were charged extra for each sauce. The cornbread was good. Overall, this a good BBQ place, not the best we have eaten, not the worst we have eaten. Not a place for cheap beer - one draft cost $6.00. \u00a0We have a much better BBQ join in Indianapolis - if you ever drive thru, try Squealers.",

It's no longer a great value. If you buy a sandwich, side, and a drink, you're spending around $13 (counting tax and tip). Yeah, I get that some of their meat is coming from local farms and stuff and it's more expensive as a result. I really don't care. The use of local animals has priced me out of the restaurant. 2. The wait times are completely unacceptable. Unless you eat between 2-4pm, you can count on a wait of around 30-45 minutes. It's okay if you want this to be your major activity of the night, but sadly, it's no longer a place where you can stop in for a quick and inexpensive BBQ sandwich. The mix of inconvenience and increased cost has led me to downgrade my review of what was formerly one of my favorite restaurants. Also, I'm not nearly as impressed with the quality of the food after trying Smoque BBQ in Chicago.

They smoke the whole thing 12 hours, trim the point, then dry rub the point and resmoke it 12 hours. This cut was in very limited supply so I wanted to get there early. Luckily we got there in time. I ordered the burnt end sandwich which was topped with vinegar based cole slaw with some purple cabbage in there and their signature vinegar red barbecue \u00a0 \u00a0sauce. Smoky, spicy, and tart. As my side I choose the sweet potato fries, which were highly recommended here on yelp. The fries were nice and crisp but seemed like I got the end of a batch because they were all small, short fries. Another great thing about The Black Dog is it has a tremendous beer selection. I had an Avery Maharaja Imperial IPA. Extremely hopped and sitting nice at 10%. The food was great but what have them a 3 star rating was when the air kicked on. Once this happened, dust was flying every where. It was all over my shirt and the table. I am sure I ate some but I could not give up this fine meal. Seems as if a spring cleaning was in order.

I love tofu that is somewhat dry and crispy. I would not have known such possibilities in tofu texture existed if it weren't for Chopstix (kidding, It could have been anywhere, but as far as I can recall it just so happened to be Chopstix). Unfortunately, I don't remember the first day I tried the tofu here, but before that I would have easily given Chopstix 2 or 3 stars, because their meat game is whack. After eating their tofu, I think that what they have lost in meat cred has been regained in tofu merit. I usually order the General Tso tofu combo with spring rolls (I think the spring rolls are good too) and have also tried the Szechaun, Orange, Sesame, and Kung Pao tofu. I prefer the General Tso, Sesame and Orange tofu because they often tend to contain the dryer, crispier tofu texture I adore. The meat dishes I've tried aren't that great (i've tried the sweet and sour, sesame, general tso, orange and kung pao chicken); compared to other restaurants in the area, it ceases to impress.Another thing it has going for itself is the fact that it stays open later than most; this gives the standard weekend drunkard no choice but to darken it's doorsteps (which honestly isn't that hard after a couple of drinks and if you like the dry, crispy tofu texture as I do).",

Chopstix is a new Chinese restaurant on Green and 2nd. \u00a0My roommate has been ordering food there a couple of times and encouraged me to try it. The menu is like any other chinese restaurant: soup, appetizer, poultry, fried rice, etc. The girl who picked up the phone was very nice. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken entree which included a side of whtie rice and was priced $9.05. A lot of the entrees are p riced between $8-9 which isn't too bad. It's on the border of pricey, however, I don't mind paying this much from Chopstix. They have a combo platter which I wouldn't recommend ordering. The combo platter is priced between $7-$7.50 and is a smaller portion than the entree. It is served with steamed white rice or fried rice with a choice of either egg roll or spring roll. The portion is too small and they don't give you enough meat in the combo platter. In addition, the egg roll isn't that great. However, my General Tso Chicken entree came in a timely manner. It was hot and fresh. The delivery guy was very polite and I gave him a $2 tip. On the side note, I just found out that they will charge a $1.50 delivery fee if your order is $15.00... oh well. I'm excited that they're open till 3AM which I need to take advantage of in the future. Anyways, I would recommend ordering at Chopstix again. Thank you, roomie for this awesome recommendation.",

The cheese tasted great, and there was not 16 tons of it piled on, which can sometimes ruin the pie. Also of good quantity (and quality) was the sauce. It was flavorful and the pizza was not swimming in it, which is all too frequent a problem in the world of crappy deep-dish.The sausage itself was pretty tasty. I'm not sure if it was fresh or not, we probably should have asked. Back home, fresh toppings are deciding factors for my family, since we can be pizza Nazis. Either way, I just wish there was more of it on the pizza. There was probably only 1-2 little balls per slice, which in my opinion could have been more plentiful.I will definitely order Papa Del's again and recommend it to anyone who enjoys deep dish.",

A salad can contain something other than iceberg lettuce. It's even available here in the midwest now, if the local grocery stores are any indication. Use it.My nephew ordered breadsticks that were just gross. Huge batons of bread (the pizza dough?) with a nuclear cheese or marinara sauce. They were completely unflavored.

In Chicago, stuffed pizza usually has a lot of cheese with only a little bit of crust. This pizza was totally the opposite, with hardly any cheese and a crust as thick as a loaf of bread. The crust also had a bread texture with no flavor whatsoever. I noticed a number of tables around leaving nearly half of their crust before they moved onto the next slice. When you have to leave that much crust behind, something is wrong Also, there was hardly any sauce on the pizza, and the sauce was burnt as well. Another thing they did was add A LOT of oregano on top. If it was a good pizza, it should be able to stand alone without any help. The addition of this oregano makes me wonder if the restaurant isn't confident in their pizza. While I kindly asked for the rest of my pizza to be put in a to-go bad, I threw it away in a garbage can near my car, as I knew I would never finish it at home.I also ordered garlic bread with cheese. The bread was hardly toasted, and the cheese peeled right off. Again, very disappointing.I was thinking that this would be a good alternative to Chicago-style stuffed pizza. But what I had tonight was anything but Chicago-style. Basically a loaf of bread with mediocre sausage and burnt sauce.",

First, let me remind you there is a difference between stuffed, deep dish, pan, double dough, thin, and extra thin. Examples: Papa Del's=Stuffed (stuffed crust, cheese, EXTRA THIN LAYER OF DOUGH, Sauce). Nancy's, Giordano's, and my local favorite growing up, Gianorio's of Winfield excel in making this type of pizza. Deep Dish=Lou Malnati's/Gino's East (crust, cheese, sauce)Pan= Connie's (THICKer.....crust, sauce, cheese) I want to say Papa Del's Sicilian is very similar to this, but it is their specialty that I have not tried as of yet, but I will soon!Double Dough= Self explanatory. Usually closed to hand tossed.Thin= Average local joints mix between this double dough. Think Home Run Inn, Domino's standard, Papa John's. Pub crust is often used here as well.Cracker thin=specialty, like Vito and Nick's Anyway, now that we have that all settled, Papa Del's still gave me pause before ordering...especially when I ordered, the clerk didn't seem too happy to know that I had 20 coupons (10 dolla off any L/XL pizza). One of my best friends' sisters actually had a run in at this location with a waitress which is the reason why I had waited so long to try this place! Again, why let some snobby undergrad waitress ruin the nostalagia that is crust, cheese, sauce, and love?Decided on the Super Stuffed Cheese. 21.64 our total, which was before the coupon. We'd have to wait an hour and since I live 25 minutes from here, it worked out well.The stuffed pizza was AMAZING! The clerk was actually very nice, the total ended up being under $11 with the coupons, and I had a \"pizza warmer\" in my car for the long drive! SCORE! I thought the crust would be dry, but it was full of flavor! The cheese is the highlight of this pizza for sure! The seasoning in the sauce really wasn't there, but what do you expect in a college town pizza joint? Well, have high expectations for this place!Some of the best pizza I have ever had! I would put it in my top 10 pizza experiences of my life! Even though the drive through the rain sucked on I 57, I know I will be back!I was so worried it would not be up to my high standard, but I can't wait to have it again...plus even try the Sicilian!

Don't give me that thin garbage (thin is good, but its not za). I want to eat my pizza with a fork and knife, and Papa Del's Super Stuffed fit the bill!Note: Please don't get me started on people who don't know the difference between Deep Dish/Pan vs. Stuffed. If you have a question, just ask, because I will thoroughly explain it to you.Our order took about an hour, which is fine, because you can't rush perfection. Our total was very cheap too, because my bro acquired 20 coupons for a special deal.I'll be honest, I was a bit skeptical because this is Champaign.... a very far cry from Chicago. Once you are south of 80... be very wary of Pizza! now to the good stuff: the super Stuffed. It was fantastic! The crust looked sort of dry on the initial viewing, but on tastinhg, it was awesome. It has a nice chew, but was not chewy or crunchy. As for the cheese, the pizza had plenty, which was awesome as well. The sauce was very good too; it wasn't amazing, but it was seasoned nicely and did not just get dumped from a can (unless I'm totally !off, which I doubt). I actually wish there was more sauce, but oh well.I was pleasantly surprised at how good papa Del's was. IT made me feel like I was still eating Za from Chicago, which is a very good thing.Will I be back? You can count on it.

That I devoured completely on my own. Oh sweet free deliciousness.Everybody has their own opinions about the best pizza in Chambanavoy. Unfortunately, many of them are wrong. Papa Dels is the best. Half a medium cheese deep dish is enough to kick my fat butt. However, it does take forever and it is fairly spendy.Eating in is not always awesome. Being that it takes them 45+ minutes to cook a pizza, you'll see a lot of people sitting around waiting for their pizza (since some people are silly enough not to call in their order ahead of time). This means that it can sometimes be tricky to get seated - due to all the people waiting (AKA Papa Del's noobs). Service ranges from mediocre to OK.Bathrooms are clean and they have toilet paper that is a step or two above \u00a0the stadium grade/industrial sandpaper variety.Overall, I can't imagine Chambanavoy without Papa Del's.

Though it is thick and cooked in a pan, I don't really consider this to be a Chicago deep dish pie, but I consider Del's pan pizza to be a style of its own. Though the pan pizza is good, I feel it is overrated by most patrons as it has a disproportionately high ratio of dough to toppings.My preference therefore is Del's thin, which I think is the unsung hero of the Papa Del's menu. Their thin pizza has a crust roughly 1/4 inch thick, which comes out from the oven crispy on the bottom and softened by the ingredients on top. To me, the thin pizza's proportion of dough to sauce, cheese, and other toppings is just about perfect.Normal cooking time for a thin is 30 minutes and for a thick (pan) is 45 minutes. Adjust \u00a0these numbers upward if you are dining at a busy time, particularly on Illini home football game weekends.Del's serves excellent garlic bread which will tide you over between the time you sit down and the time your pizza is served. Service and the overall dining experience at Papa Del's can be spotty at times. The main dining room is a building whose tall ceilings and walls turns it into a bit of an echo chamber; the space would be improved by wall treatment that would deaden the sound. Groups of patrons are sometimes doubled up at the long tables with other groups of patrons, even when there's plenty of vacant dining space available, and the college-aged wait staff can be hard to flag down at times, though at other times they are attentive and responsive.For those reasons I order for pick-up (Papa Del's also offers delivery) more often than not. In any event, my fondness for Papa Del's is not about the service and dining experience; it's all about the pizza.",

All the tables are essentially crammed into a corner, which not only makes for a sometimes spatially uncomfortable seating arrangement, but also for a very unamusing game of who can shout the loudest to overcome the raucous echoes from other tables. Whether you dine in or out of the restaurant, expect a longer wait that usual. This isn't the usual pizza, so naturally it requires more than the usual time to prepare.

Doom for some good pizza.My experience: Meh.So, I think that people really love Papa Del's because that's where they went in college. It brings back fond memories of late nights or drinking or whatever. I get that. I am very nostalgic for certain college hangouts of my own. However. Papa Del's pizza SUCKED.I might be a bit unfair in my review. It might be amazing if you get a fresh pie made. It could be incredible. But the slices we got at 1:30 pm (after 20 minutes wait)? SUCKED.They were hardly warm, yet still had dark-brown spots from spending too long waiting to be served. Husband had a sandwich, which he said was decent, but everyone had talked up this pizza. Said it was better than Vinny's, better than Rosati's, etc. WHAT. It wasn't inedible, but I was far from impressed.Service wasn't outright rude, but also wasn't fantastic. I get it, it's lunch rush on a Saturday. You're used to getting treated poorly by college kids. Still, I expect a certain level of positive attitude from waitstaff.

I'm just a regular person who eats food. Sometimes I eat that food in Chicago. Most times I eat it in Portland. But in my 28 years of eating food, I've never eaten pizza that I like better than Papa Del's. The last time I was visiting, I even stuffed a frozen pizza into my checked luggage to take back to Portland, where I threw it in the oven a mere 90 minutes after my plane landed. What I mean to say is: this is special, special pizza.I'm seeing a lot of complaints about service, but that's missing the point. Does one complain about climbing a mountain to obtain wisdom from the guru at the top? (Actually, I probably would.) Yes, the service is miserable, but that's just part of the journey! There are two seating options to choose from while you wait (and wait, and wait): a sterile, cavernous dining room, or the small bar area, where the jukebox will inevitably be blaring an entire Journey album. Oh, neither of those suits you? Sheesh, why not ask Jesus to tidy up his manger while you're at it? The service has never improved at all during the 10 years I've been eating here, so it's futile to even spend time wishing it would; it's just what you have to deal with if you want the pizza.There is this part of the crust where the cheese sort of gets stuffed inside, and it's all gooey and amazing and occasionally I think about it when I'm supposed to be thinking of something else. I start eating each piece with a fork, but about 2/3 of the way up, I always just give in and eat it with my hands so I can best enjoy those precious bites that meld with the crust. The breadsticks are like giant loaves of bread, and you can get them with the pizza sauce or with this nacho cheese that I would normally reject outright, but for some reason it's amazing here. And really, I can only eat two slices, but sometimes I dare myself to go for three, and damn it if it isn't worth the stomach ache every time. What was it I said before?

But, I was craving some chicago style pizza, and I had an hour so I thought I'd be fine.I walk in and stare at the 2 workers in the place for 5 minutes. Finally he asks \"Can I help you?\" Something about the way he said it just rubbed me the wrong way. It felt like he thought I was intruding upon his precious time. Granted, the restaurant was pretty full, and they seemed understaffed so I just asked for a table. He told me to \"sit tight\", which I did. I sat tight for at least 15 minutes without anyone paying any more attention to me. An update on time would have been really nice. Even just saying a word to remind me that I hadn't become invisible would have been appreciated. Of course they were too busy running past me to say anything though. After wasting 20 minutes of my lunch break, I gave up and left.Hopefully I can come back and actually try the food. But, the service here is really poor from what I can tell. The pizza better be amazing; otherwise, I don't think I'll be tempted to come back here.",

I know I'm in a very, very small minority here but honestly, I'd just as soon get Pizza Hut. It's cheaper and doesn't take as long. For me, the taste is about the same.Part of this could be my status as a \"thin-crust guy\" but even after trying their thin crust, I wasn't impressed. Besides the sauce being of the persuasion that induces heart burn 90% of the time for me, the crust wasn't like a cracker, but more like cardboard. I won't comment too much on the deep dish, but I will say that the sausages were nice and crispy which is something I'd like to see more on pizza in general. The crust, which should be the best part of deep dish was kind of chewy......for me. I'm not the definitive pizza reviewer.I would give this place three stars; however, minus one star for service, which was really bad. We had a large group and one of the servers in particular was rather abrasive when we asked to have a large table. Our main server didn't do a good job either of keeping drinks filled, which normally is not a pet peeve for me, but when I've gone an hour sans fill up, I tend to get cranky.",

The very concept of deep dish pizza goes against this philosophy of mine, almost to the point where I wouldn't even consider it pizza at all.Regardless of that, I will gladly eat a medium sausage deep dish style pizza from Papa Del's any day. Yes, Papa Del's serves the only deep dish pizza I will eat anywhere. I think that's a good enough endorsement.Don't overlook their thin crust pizza, though. It's every bit as good as the deep dish in my opinion and it's a solid option for the lighter appetites.I can't really say the service itself is bad like all of the other reviewers are saying.

There was, however, quite a wait before a server came by to take our order; it was probably 15 minutes and then we finally just flagged someone down.Boeyond that, everything was great. We ordered a pan pizza and after an hour (which they tell you is the wait time for a pan pizza), it was brought out in all its glory. It was amazing. Just like a Manalti pizza exept it lacked the one thing I HATE about most Chicago style pizzas - the chunky sauce! The sauce was smooth but flavorful and full of spices. I cannot stand chunky pizza sauce so I was very excited. It was SO GOOD. The slices were so thick and loaded that I was full after just one. We ended up taking more than half the pie home.Our dining partners had the \"thin crust\", and I use quotes because it really was what I would consider to be hand tossed in thickness. It looked wonderful and I would like to try it next time.All in all, worth the wait. The building is set up oddly but they make it work.

Papa Del's is an institution in Champaign-Urbana. I've read reviews that say it's not as good as Chicago's own Chicago-style. To that I say Bull-hocky! You're just hating on Champaign because you're here for school and you miss you're hometown! I've had Papa D's deep dish and Gino's East in Chi-town. Side-by-side I don't think I could tell the difference. I've never ordered a thin crust or a sandwich at Papa D's so I can only speak to their most beloved menu item, the Super-Stuffed pizza. (The pizza President Clinton ordered when Air Force One landed in Champaign). I have nothing to say other than it's awesome. It's great. It's the bee's knees. It's the spider's web. (does that last one make sense?). Seriously though, if you like stuffed pizza, get a Papa Del's sausage (or pepperoni) and spinach (unless you hate spinach). Two big draw backs to Papa D's: It's on campus. So us townies can wait to sample it's offers three times a year (spring break, summer break, and winter break), or, or!, order from the NEW, NEW! location at Village at the Crossing (you're welcome Papa D, call (217) 359-5500). I've never ordered from that location, but I've eaten that location's pizza and it's just as awesome as the Green street location, minus the students and traffic.The other big drawback is the delicious deep-dish takes a while to create and bake, so you have to be patient or order ahead of time. If you dine-in at the Green Street location you can plan on waiting 90 minutes if you're in a large group. Alone or in a smaller group the usual wait time is closer to 45 minutes. If you order-out or arrive when the students are gone you can expect to wait less. BOTTOM LINE:Great food + long wait time - fair price - \"I can't believe you haven't tried this already\" = worth it. If you live in Champaign more than a year and you like pizza, I won't respect you if you haven't at least tired Papa D's (stuffed pizza).",

You enjoy a beer, maybe another. The server comes back to get your order. Wait, I already ordered? You place it again, waiting...waiting. Finally, after an eternity, a manager comes out: \"she forgot to put your pizza order in.\" Really? Seriously? After placing it twice? We order again. 40 minutes later, we get a pizza. It's delicious. But, we could have been in Chicago for the time it took to get. And then, at least, we would have been in Chicago. I \"suppose\" if you like to complain and feel you want to wait a small eternity for a pizza (that's delicious!) go to Papa Del's.

We had a large group and ordered several deep dish pizzas. \u00a0The others came out as expected, but as their pizzas came to the table our waitress realized she had forgotten to put in the order for a deep dish pizza my friend and I were splitting. \u00a0This is a pretty big mistake to make considering it takes a good 45 minutes to an hour to make a deep dish. \u00a0What's worse is what happened after that. Instead of offering to bring us an appetizer on the house or something to hold us over (I was pretty starving at this point and we had already been there for an hour) she simply says \"I would understand if you don't tip me, I'm sorry\" \u00a0and offered to make us a thin crust instead. I don't care for thin crust pizza so I declined and said we would just wait. \u00a0About fifteen minutes later she comes by and offers some garlic bread so we accepted that. However, she waited so long to offer it that we got it just before our pizza came out and we no longer wanted it. Basically it was just a really frustrating experience and the waitress could have been more helpful considering it was her big mistake. \u00a0I also didn't realize that it costs $4 for a Diet Coke. I mean, it's a large cup, but c'mon. That's pretty steep even with getting a refill. On top of that, when we got our pizza, I was not impressed. For the time I spent here, I could have just driven to Chicago and had a real deep dish pizza. It might be the best in Champaign, but I don't think it's worth waiting for.",

I agree with the dude from Peoria, AZ, if you want fast service, do go to pizza hut. What separates Del's pizza to Hut's pizza is the attention to detail the pizza you eat at Del's gets. There is a process t making their pizza. True can be said of Pizza Hut's, but Del's is deliberate and the end product is a pizza you can be proud to eat. I have eaten here 3 times and I loved it every time. Not only is the pizza delish, the place is immaculate. Walking in the restaurant, you are transported out of Central Illinois and to a different region of the world. There is a great contrast and this adds to the experience. There is a fountain, the tiles look like its from Italy, the two storied dining area gives the place a cool feel to it.The pricing is just right. True, to a person used to eating at Antonio's, Pizza Hut, or Sbarro, the pricing may seem high, but consider the quality of food compared to Papa Del's- not even close. So, it is well worth the extra few dollars to eat here. Plus the pizza is so damn filling. So, when you think about it, you are paying for your food for the day and possibly tomorrow.The only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because although they do accept credit cards in the store; they do not accept then for ordering out. I called there and I got less than desirable service. I wanted pizza to order out one day because I was too lazy to leave my apartment, but whatever, I wound up just walking back to the restaurant and ordering my food there. They should accept credit cards over the phone. But, that's about all I have to complain about. To summarize,Best- Great food, excellent service, unique looking place, big portions, reasonable priceWorst- Don't accept credit Cards over the phone",

It's a typical Chicago-style pie, baked in a heavily oiled, round, black steel pan. The crust is thick, bready, and slightly sweet. It doesn't just line the bottom, but extends up the side of the pan to contain the filling like a tart shell. This makes for a very high crust-to-filling ratio. The cheese -- at least a half-pound of a mozzarella blend in a \"small\" pie -- goes on the bottom, to prevent the crust from becoming soggy I guess. The sausage -- another half-pound, highly seasoned with fennel and garlic -- goes on next. It's raw when they put it in the oven, so all the fat oozes out as it bakes, mixing with the crushed tomatoes that cover the pie on top to form a delicious, meaty tasting sauce. I forget whether additions like mushrooms or onions go on top of or underneath the tomatoes -- underneath I think. \u00a0But one doesn't really care about the vegetables -- it's all about the cheese, the sausage, and the tomatoes. Best ... pizza ... ever! (as Comic Book Guy would say). Oh, and the lasagna dinner (with meat sauce) isn't bad either, if you're not in the mood for pizza.",

About a half-hour later she brings the first of the two we ordered. She then tells us I have some bad news that may be good news. She tells us she gave our second pizza to the wrong table however if we still want it the other table only ate a couple of pieces and we can have it for 50% off!I thought she was kidding but she was completely serious. I told her that was pretty gross and that we wanted a fresh pizza. She puts the order in and 45 minutes later the pizza still wasn't at our table although most of the people eating had left. Finally it came 50 minutes after she reordered. I asked to speak to the manager. The waitress came back and said the manager was busy and would only come out if we really wanted to talk to him but he would give us a discount.I told her I wanted to talk to him. A few minutes later a kid comes out of the kitchen wearing gloves and holding a spatula. I told him what happened and how long we waited and he said sorry. That was it. I told him about our waitress offering a partially eaten pizza and he said he talked to her about that. I am pretty sure she got someone from the kitchen to come out and not the manager. Long story short they took $5 off after we spent 2 hours in the restaurant. I will never go backObservations:The restaurant is dirty and needs a good cleaning The whole restaurant is dated and the finishes are worn out. The wait staff is clueless, obviously because nobody manages them.The only reason the restaurant is still going is because there is no real competition.Trust me go somewhere else where they want your business and maybe they clean once in a while..",

My two favorites were the artichoke dip and the ahi tuna wonton (but again, I like everything with ahi tuna). The sandwiches were also really good too. We also got all their desserts (they had like 3 to choose from), and I loved the creme brulees. Best of all, the price was surprisingly cheap!The drinks were mostly good. Their beer of the month was good and cheap at $3. Other than that, their drinks fall in the $6-9 range which is a little steep for a town like Champaign. However, they make their drinks really strong, so you kinda have to pace yourself through the drinks.Overall, I like this place a lot. Great ambient, great food, great drinks, reasonable price.

We checked out Boltini twice, each time deciding on Wed. since it's their half-price-drink night.The first try was a few weeks ago and relatively early in the night I guess (9pm). We all, especially me, really liked the place itself; a loungey, chill vibe. I'm not a beer guy so I was very pleased with their great drink selections AND all 1/2 price! I thought this was a sure winner. It was kinda slow, and the main reason we left that time after only one drink was that the demographics threw us off. After some shifting during the 20mins. or so, there ended up being 5 couples there: all same-sex, 4 of the 5 were guys. Being new to the area, we didn't know if we found ourselves in a gay bar. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but it's just not conducive to keeping single straight guys around.This past week we came back because I was assured that it was a place open to all, so I talked the others into trying it again. On this, our second attempt (and third; we ended up coming back later), we got there around 10pm. It was later than the last time so I expected a bit more of a crowd. I guess that's my only complaint about this place. We gave it more of a chance, sticking around for just under an hour. It was worthwhile, but just not getting as active as we hoped. It did seem to start to shift as we were heading out, but he others had decided to move on.We ended up back there an hour later. The scene was about the same as when we were leaving; still just on the brink of happenin'. We stayed for about 45min, and I easily could have spent the rest of the night there but the others wanted to go back to the clubby place we closed at on our previous night.When we go back next week I think I WILL be sticking around if the vibe is right letting the others move on. I really want to love this place cuz it has all the right attributes for me (almost). Here's to hoping my next review will be 5 stars!",

The servers are as good or better than any other bar in CU that comes to mind (and, for better or worse, I drink nearly everywhere).The place where Boltini really stands apart (for me) are their martinis and mixed drinks. If you order a dirty martini, for example, but specify that you want it only a little dirty they'll get it just right. Their Old Fashioned is quite a production. I forget what all Robb (mgr) put in it, but it was delightful. My absolute favorite mixed drink at Boltini is their Sugar Plum. It sounds pretty froofy, and it is indeed delightfully delish, but this straight arrow stands behind this very strong and very purple (tasting) beverage. I am not sure if the fact that I order mine without sugar on the rim of the glass makes my Sugar Plum swilling any less emasculating, but I do want that fact noted for the record.Lastly, Boltini's hosts 'Tuesday Night Trivia', starting every Tuesday night at 7pm. It is a lot of fun and all you have to do is come with a friend or two or 4 (I think 5 is the max, but it may be 6) and let them know your team name. At this trivia night, as opposed to Canopy Club's, which takes place at the exact same time, team names are punny, but not perverse. The host(s) pass out answer sheets for you to fill in and ask several rounds of questions over the PA. Dont be afraid to ask questions if you are curious. Competition is fun, and the whole thing lasts about 2-2.5 hours. Winners get prizes, including free drinks, appetizers, and even massages. The crowd is good: think professionals, teachers, librarians, grad students and profs. I don't go regularly anymore because it is just a 'lil too dear and also a 'lil to slow. Canopy Club's questions come faster. NTN trivia at BW3's is faster still.Park behind Boltini's in the lot.",

If you like laid back beer-bars like Esquire or Mike and Molly's, you'll be confronted with something entirely different at Boltini. If you're interested in paying a bit more for girly, froo-froo cocktails, food that looks like food only smaller, or an entirely different experience this is the place for you. My most memorable moment at Boltini: asking for a Blue Moon and being handed a bottle (it's on draft everywhere else), and nearly spitting it out when I was told it would cost $4.75! (UPDATE: Blue Moon's are $4.25, not $4.75). They also assigned a single waitress to a group of over 20. When the clearly over-worked waitress couldn't keep up with the groups demands for drinks, I went to bar, and was rudely told by the snobby bartender woman that she couldn't add my beer to my tab because I had started the tab with the waitress. Again, I feel this would be an easy request for any other downtown pub to fill; but Boltini staff are too good to add one number to another number. That being said, if you're interested in fancy cocktails and fancy food--and are willing to pay extra for it--you'll probably like this place. If you're not a cocktail drinker, then skip this place.UPDATE: Thanks to Robb for responding to my concerns. Like I said, it's not my taste, but many people seem to like it.

There were only a few individuals when we got there. We started the night with drinks, continued the night with drinks, and ended the night with drinks. Oh, and maybe some food. We each had martinis to start and were fairly pleased. Then I stumbled upon this gem of a mojito - strawberry basil. There were no mint mojitos due to the seasonality of mint - I love when restaurants acknowledge this fact. However, strawberries are in season, and made the most delicious drink. Maybe this is why I had 3.Oh, yeah, there's food. Do yourself a favor and order a cheese plate. A lot of the cheeses are from local farms and DELICIOUS. I continued the cheese parade with the Mac and Cheese. Cheddar and strong blue cheese? YUM. By the time we left (about 9:45pm - we take our time!) this place was PACKED, and much louder.Maybe since I'm used to paying Chicago prices for drinks, I found this place to be very reasonable. My mojitos were $8. We spent $95 on drinks, $50 on food, and were stuffed and well \"hydrated\" and very pleased. \u00a0Very pleasant service, although as Boltini got busier, we saw our waitress less (she was also doubling as a bartender).

It's sort of an odd shaped restaurant, and I understand it's easy to lose a table in the shuffle. However, I still need to knock them down a star for it (but knocking them down 4 stars was way too much).

Think black leather semi-circle booths with high backs in the middle of the room. Towards the back of the room are black leather rectangular IKEA couches with glass tables and candlelight everywhere.The drinks are large, mixed well, strong, and tasty. Personally, I prefer a perfect (half dry, half sweet vermouth) gin martini, shaken.You CANNOT go wrong with the cheese plates here. Make sure to come at least in a group of four so you can order the 3 cheese plate. You choose from a cheese list and it is brought out with sliced baguettes (toasted and non-toasted), fruit (green apple slices, grapes), and olives. I would highly recommend the gueyere, euro cream, and the cheese infused with port wine. But seriously, pick and choose to your hearts content because the pairing of great cheese with great drinks will make you feel reallll sexy.I exposed my friends for the first time to Boltinis last weekend and they were highly impressed with the classy setting, quick servers, and amazing cheese and drinks. Even on a hectic Saturday night, we found a nice seating area in the back of the pit for all 8 of us.Boltini Lounge is a place that should stay hidden (thank God it's in dtown Champaign and not on campus) for its adventurous, sick-of-underage-teenybopper-gangsta-wannabes, discriminating clientele. I tell my friends that Boltini Lounge is where the people sick of the same scene at Joe's, Fubar, or even SoMa turn to.We will be there again tomorrow night for a birthday :)EDIT:Only downside is that they don't serve wine...

We shared a mushroom/goat cheese crostini appetizer. The mushrooms and cheese were sort of creamed together, which I wasn't happy with at first, but liked it once I tasted it. I had the lobster bisque, which was a special, and it was a nice price (I think $5 for a nicely sized bowl). The drinks will kick your ass... in a good way. Our waiter was SO FUN. Only downside is that we were checked on a little too often, and weren't really given enough privacy to chow down.",

Started by sharing a huge bowl of Roasted Red Pepper & Smoked Gouda soup. Towards the bottom of the bowl, it started to get spicy. The spice was nicely counterbalanced by bits of bacon.Next, we shared a generous cheese plate with baguettes and fresh fruits. We chose three cheeses that would not be incorporated into other portions of our meal. Porter Cheese, Goat Cheese, and Bacon-Encrusted Brie. The Brie was excellent. It might be related to my obsession with bacon. I will tell you that somehow I passed on ordering their 12 perfectly cooked pieces of bacon appetizer.Finally, we ordered three small plates. Mushroom crostinis, crab cakes and bacon-wrapped blue affine stuffed dates. Crab cakes had a tropical feel because of a light slaw with fruit incorporated. The dates were delicious but heavy and rich. The portion included six dates. That would be great for six people as one was enough.Great night with great service. However, we got the feeling that we needed to initially command the attention of a server. The restaurant's tables are first come first serve and that chaotic feeling carried over into getting a server's attention that we were at the restaurant to eat and not just drink. If you aren't assertive, you may find it hard to get a table and to get service.",

Delivery time was very fast and we used their convenient online ordering.My roommate really liked his Pad Thai and my Mussamun curry was decent as well, in terms of flavor. My only reservations about Siam Terrace is the price. Yes, you get very large portion of food, but to be honest I didn't think either dish was worth over $10. The meat quality, at least on the beef was not very good, as I'm beginning to see with all Asian restaurants down here. I don't get it, do they not want to purchase good beef?I think if the meat was higher quality it might be worth it, but the high price really turned me off.The flavor and authenticity of the dish was spot on, though. The exact taste was a really interesting combination of sweet, spicy and creaminess. I thought the curry was pretty liquid-y itself but maybe Thai curry is not the same as Indian curry? I'm not sure.3.5/5 for authenticity, quick delivery, portion size and just something unique.I will have to try something else!",

Basically, the food was okay. \u00a0However, the price for the two lunch specials + 2 iced teas + one thai tea (also incredibly sweet, but it's supposed to be) was about $22 with tax. \u00a0For that price, I found myself wishing we'd gone somewhere else and I can't say that anything else on the menu made me want to return.",

I ordered from the \"House Specialty\" section of the Thai Cuisine menu and got the \"Ramrong with chicken\" (steamed broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, green beans, baby corn, celery and Napa cabbage topped with \"special peanut sauce\").The order was ready very quickly (5-10 minutes after I ordered) which was a plus, but the food was very, very disappointing. Basically it was a to go container filled with boiled vegetables and chicken. The chicken was thin, gray, and unseasoned and the vegetables were also completely devoid of flavor. The only somewhat redeeming part of the dish was the \"special peanut sauce\" that was a tiny portion compared to the amount of rice and vegetables given. The peanut sauce reminded of the Woody Allen quote in Annie Hall, \"The food at this place is terrible.\" \"Ya, and such small portions.\"I digress...All of this being said, I don't know if I will ever order takeout from Siam Terrace again. However, walking inside the restaurant to pickup my order I did see what some of the guests were eating and it looked much better than my sad plate of Ramrong.",

Between the four of us, we ordered, the Lava Trio, Pad Thai, Thai beef noodle soup (Thai pho) with a crab rangoon on the side, and a vegetarian tofu stir fry. We also ordered three rolls of sushi Atmosphere (2/5)Not fancy, very casual, chill. Like most Champaign Asian restaurants, a little dingy. There is a small outdoor seating section, and some nice natural light near the front with the windows.Food (3/10)Let me start with the good. The crab rangoon was good. I mistakenly ordered it after reading the reviews for the My Thai crab rangoon, but I was pleasantly surprised because I enjoyed it. The Lava Trio was also decent. Not the freshest seafood (alright not fresh at all), but it was tasty albeit expensive. That is all that was good about this place. The Pad Thai and vegetable stir were both \u00a0too salty and too sweet. The beef noodle soup was basically salted basil water, with a heaping serving of oil. On top of that, our server decided not to bring out thesushi until well after we were finished eating the rest of the food despite asking for the sushi first. When the sushi finally came out, one of the rolls, called the White Bear, came with very little scallop in the roll, and on top of that, my dad who orders the roll regularly, commented on how it was the worst White Bear he has ever had. The Volcano was some kind of crab cake on top of a basic California roll. The Bangkok roll, which I ordered after reading various reviews, was a heap load of good ingredients thrown together into one mess of a roll. That one I picked apart and ate the pieces individually. Not bad.Service (2/5)Our server seemed nice enough, but unfamiliar with the menu. When I asked for opinions about her favorite dishes, she barely had any opinions because she barely had touched the food. At least she was honest. However, When we complained about the White Bear being subpar, she gave us a dirty questioning look, apologized, and offered free desert as compensation, which unfortunately, we did not try because we were full. Value (2/5)The food was not that good. Ok it was pretty bad. And also not cheap. Our billcame to over 100 for four people. Three of us did not enjoy our meal. Overall the whole experience breaks down like so: Atmosphere: 2/5 (Dingy with some decent natural lighting near the windows.)Service: 2/5 (Server gave us dirty looks when we complained about the White Bear.)Value: 1/5 (Small portions + bad food = sad wallet.)Food: 3/10 (Parts of the meal were edible but not much was enjoyable.)Overall: 8/25 - Would have to pull teeth to make me go back. Try at your own risk. Maybe you will have better luck.",

I was expecting them to come in a bowl cooked in sauce as I'm used to, but these are served on a plate with a dish of cold sauce to dip them in. The sauce is a vinaigrette that was supposed to have some heat, but I didn't notice any. The spider roll was exactly what I'm used to. Very small wasabi/ginger portions! The chicken satay was a-ok. I've had amazing, this doesn't compare. The peanut sauce really helped, though. The lava chicken had no heat at all. It looked tasty but was actually very bland.

Don't let that detract you from choosing something else on the menu though. The rad nar, pad thai, and other options are all excellent choices. I'm just particular I guess.It's not quite five stars just because sometimes it does feel a little cramped if you have four or more people (and the proximity of the tables feels a tad off), but I'd have to say it's more than four. Appetizers are alright, it's hard to go wrong with basic fare although the shrimp appetizer is quite good and I heartily recommend it.While I put it at $$ it's more like $ and a half. Prices are very reasonable, with my favorite red curry starting at $8.99 or so for the vegetarian, chicken, or tofu options, and a bit higher for meat entrees (usually no more than $12 in the case of seafood).",

Both restaurants have their particular strengths so part of it depends on what you're in the mood for. The staff is very friendly although sometimes a little slow if it gets busy. I think they have the best pad thai in town. To me it has the perfect blend of sweetness, nutiness and spice complimented by the fresh bite of the cilantro and crunch of sprouts and shredded carrot. It's sweeter than your typical pad thai but it's very well balanced overall.Their appetizers are nicely priced and I have enjoyed all of them that I tried. I would not recommend the Thom Kha soup here. It's a bit too sweet and lacks some of the depth of other versions of this soup I've had. It's not bad by any means, but it wasn't what I was looking for in that soup. Be bold with spice here. It can vary, but I find that they tend to be a bit more gentle with the spice overall.A big plus for Siam Terrace is its selection of sushi. It's decently priced for the most part and everything I've had is tasty. I'd definitely recommend their Bakery sushi. It's moderately priced and is battered and served with some excellent eel sauce. Be careful when you first get it though as it's VERY hot.For a drink, I recommend trying the coconut juice or Thai Iced Tea. Both are refreshing and a great, sweet compliment to the spicier dishes.",

Also, they dont have Siracha here so if you want it extra spicy you should ask. Recommend going there for lunch much cheaper.",

However, they definitely worked super fast and we got seated in less than 30 minutes. Being a big fan of American dining, I had always be using skillets as my control group to test the quality of the restaurant. Hearing only good things about this place, I had relatively high expectations. And long behold, this place does not disappoint.I first ordered a strawberry creme smoothie. It came in a chilled glass mug. Upon first sip, I could taste the strawberries. Not many restaurants can do that. Within a few minutes I decided to order the Blarney Skillet because I am always a sucker for corned beef. The food was served within 10-15 minutes. And Dear God, did the combination of both hit the spot! The skillet itself is not greasy, yet you feel like you are eating something substantial. The taste of the ingredients are further complemented by the hollandaise sauce, which was mixed with the two sunny-side-up eggs to perfect the combination. The waiter/waitresses were very attentive. They constantly swung by to ensure that we have enough water as my buddies and I just chatted after we finish our meals. They were super polite and gives great insight when asked to provide recommendations of items on the menu. The best part about this place is probably the price. The two items: smoothie and skillets, came to a combined total of approximately $12 including tax, which is not bad at all! I would highly recommend this place if you have a mean of transportation to get here!",

Now, I had two different cards with punches that both added up to a full card. You would think that they could add those two cards together to redeem my meal. However, when I was at the stand to redeem the card, the host wouldn't let me because the punches were on two separate cards. She told me that she could combine all of the punches on one card for me so that I could come back the next time and redeem it. That was SO generous of her. When I grudgingly paid, the host also looked at the signature line of my credit card that said \"SEE ID.\" So, she asked me, \"Do you want me to look at your ID?\" I answered no. She asked the same question to the lady behind me that paid. I'm pretty sure that asking that question defeats the purpose of writing that in the signature line. I'm not one to even care if people check my ID, but phrasing a question like that just showed the ignorance of the employees at this restaurant.The servers have always been nice, it's just the hosts (and manager I believe) that were incredibly disappointing.

I just went back here last weekend and had to update my review and give it a fifth star.Their bread is just so yummy and I could honestly make a meal out of it. I also found that their lasagna (all 8 layers of it) is reallllly good. I usually try to order something new every time I go to a restaurant, but this lasagna has me hooked. But, if I can tear myself away from the lasagna, or rather, any of the pasta dishes, I've found the salads are pretty great and they're HUGE. The wedge is one of my favorites, but any of them are really good, actually.The iced tea is also suuuper good, and so is the strawberry lemonade. There are mashed strawberries in it and it's perfectly sweet and tart. I love it.Also, the nuttela skillet cookie with ice cream, holy cow. Make sure you order it, but do it early because it takes about 10 minutes to make. It's worth the wait though. It's phenomenal!I also can't review this place without saying how nice the staff has always been here. Everyone is very polite, very proper, and you feel comfortable here wether you're in jeans and a shirt for a lunchbreak or here for a fancy dinner. It's just good for any occasion.Basically yeah, I feel kind of stupid ranting and raving about a chain restaurant, but it really is one of my favorite places in Champaign and I'm reminded of that every time I go here.",

The manager explained that they had been very busy the night before and simply ran out of most everything. \u00a0However, they still had cheesecake, chocolate cake, and lemon tower cake.Again, strange. \u00a0So they ran out of everything OTHER than the stuff that could be easily sliced and flopped on a plate for the least amount of effort.Bullshit.Indeed, we were informed by one of the kinder and more empathetic waitresses that this was a complete and utter lie. \u00a0Not only did they not run out of desserts, but they were serving them to other patrons at the restaurant. \u00a0Heck, one of our guests was even able to score the bread pudding before we were unceremoniously cut off like a drunk at closing time.I would love for somebody to explain to me why the $1,200 I spent was not good enough to: A) get what I specifically arranged for IN ADVANCE; and B) at least get the common courtesy of an honest explanation.Would I have been upset if they had told me they simply could not do the volume of desserts we were asking for? \u00a0Of course, but I would have understood, and they would not have lost me as a customer.The real problem is that this could have been dealt with when we arranged the party. \u00a0We were promised one thing, and they refused to deliver on that promise. \u00a0As it stood, we told our guests to make sure they saved room SPECIFICALLY FOR the wonderful array of desserts that would be available. \u00a0I cannot explain the disappointment on the guests faces who were given dessert menus and had wanted to order tiramisu or bread pudding, but were then told that they could not have it. \u00a0Of course, we look like the cheapskates who wouldn't spring for the good stuff. \u00a0It wrecked what should have been a special occasion. \u00a0My wife and I spent more time farting around with the dishonest manager and chef than we did with our guests. \u00a0Pathetic.I have had two parties there and countless dinners and lunches. \u00a0I will never go back.",

The strawberry lemonade is delicious, and there are lots of healthy options on the menu- Great salads and they willingly substitute marinara sauce for the fettuccini alfredo that accompanies many dishes. \u00a0I am a fan of a louder, busy atmosphere, which this restaurant has- It's always busy. It is a great way for families to get out to a nice dinner where the white tablecloths are covered with paper for coloring on.The service on this visit was not as good as usual, but it was just a timinig issue and not at all the server's fault. The manager saved the experience by jumping in and getting us taken care of like he did.The curbside take out is fast and easy too. Much appreciated!",

So you're stuck if you go with or without the sauce. I did enjoy their pork chops, though. Garlic mashed potatoes are tasty, too. Appreciate the bread baskets, but whether or not the bread actually tastes fresh is a touch-and-go issue. I dig the Champaign bartenders, though. Props to those charming folks. Strawberry daquiris are magnificent... They know how to get the tips flowing. Best way to go with Biaggi's is only use it for gift certificates or spoiling someone else on a birthday.

And a mound of pasta... mostly pasta very little seafood and for I think it was $17... yikes. (Not that you would expect fresh seafood but the shrimp were salty as if they had been but in a brine to take away their old seafood taste) \u00a0I also have gotten the wedge salad which tasted fine but was nothing special. \u00a0The lobster squid ink pasta is something I regularly got as well. \u00a0The kids menu was $7 for a bland \"pizza\".Honestly, I would just recommend to avoid the place completely.I would say the last 5 times (4 too many) throughout the past 2 years the service has been AWFUL. \u00a0I've encountered a very rude waitress who insulted the person paying for the meal as she was handing him the check. \u00a0Another time, when they were dead and we had been waiting a very long time for our food, I ran to the bathroom with my 3 year old and found her sitting in the back party room with her phone out texting/something who knows! \u00a0When I got back to the table our food still hadn't arrived. \u00a0Which this doesn't make sense to me because usually there are runners, but maybe not during the day when they are slow? \u00a0Anyway.. she finally came out with our food which had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for a VERY long time. \u00a0I had gotten a half and half pasta/salad. \u00a0My pasta had a film over the sauce from sitting and the salad was hot and wilted from sitting on the same plate under the lamp. \u00a0Again recently I ended up here when someone else was taking us out. \u00a0Two servers came up to us and claimed the other was being trained so they would both be helping us. \u00a0I thought great!.. with two we may get semi decent service. \u00a0We ordered our food, and when it came out, the pasta the person to my side had ordered came out not as it is supposed to be. \u00a0She had ordered the black pasta, which I must say has a texture to it and appeal that a normal boxed linguine does not. \u00a0The runner said \"oh.. your server didn't tell you\" and we said no and that the pasta was one of the main components of the dish. \u00a0She said nothing more, didn't offer to change it or see if she wanted something else and just kind of wandered away. \u00a0Maybe she should have been more up front about how disappointed she was when the server came back to ask how everything was, but oh well, just another nail in the coffin.Bread and pasta are cheap! \u00a0I could make any of the dishes they serve, in my own home, for a few dollars and with a lot more taste!

You see, we were in Bloomington for the Track Tournament at Wesleyan University. \u00a0We were tired, the kids were sweaty (I'm being nice) and HUNGRY and did I mention we were loud? \u00a0Well, we were given a private room, I presume in hopes of keeping the noise level down for the other patrons. Hahahaha well, it was worth the try. \u00a0Anyway, I digress, on to the service. We were assigned 5 waiters/waitresses. \u00a0They moved seamlessly throughout the private dining area, taking orders, filling and refilling beverage requests, bringing bread and conversing with us. HOW they managed to do all that AND get us in and out of there in under two hours is beyond me!The FOOD. The food was DELICIOUS! \u00a0Maybe it had something to do with the fact that we were on day two of eating food out of a cooler, but I sincerely doubt that. My husband ordered the Chicken Pimietro (I know I spelled that wrong). It was melt in your mouth good. Yes, I stole some off his plate (don't judge me). Hmmm, I hope he never reads my yelps and discovers my dirty little secret. \u00a0I, on the other hand, opted for the Chicken Pietra (succulent chicken breast stuffed with Smoked Gouda and Ham). This was served with asparagus and I asked for Herb Roasted Potatoes instead of the garlic mashed listed on the menu. Don't worry, I didn't actually eat them, I traded my potatoes for my hubby's zucchini and squash. All I can say is.....Why isn't there one of these in MD? Oh wait, I think another yelper said it was along the lines of Maggianos, but I can't say I agree. The atmosphere was different (better), the menu was less overwhelming in regards to choices and the customer service was spectacular.

I wouldnt recommend this place, if you dont like pasta/noodles all that much.

I was definitely disappointed.I ordered the Pan-Pan noodles with chicken, a Philadelphia roll, and a Spicy Salmon Roll. The noodles did not taste crispy at all even though they looked crispy. They were chewy and the sauce that gather around the bottom made the noodles very soft and chewy. I had a hard time biting the noodles. An upside of this dish was that the chicken was cooked nicely and there were tons of veggies. The Philadelphia Roll was okay. I ultimately just tasted the cream cheese, which is okay for me because I like cream cheese. For the Spicy Salmon Roll, I was very disappointed. It definitely looked like a Spicy Salmon Roll, but when I bit into it, it was completely bland. I did not even taste the spiciness. All I got was a tasteless sauce with warm fish. A few good things:-The food was visually pleasing.-The service was good. The waitress refilled my drink consistently and didn't make me wait around for the check.-It wasn't busy when I walked in, but I don't understand why the food didn't taste better if there wasn't a back-up in the kitchen.All I can say is that I'm hoping this was just a off night for the kitchen and that the food gets better.

The menu was a mixture of Asian cuisines. I expected a more Japanese menu, but I thought the menu was just all over the place (which is not a good sign in a restaurant). I got some chicken katsu-like dish which turned out to be pretty good. Huge portion, great presentation, and a bargain with my half price certificate. My friend got some mango vegetable dish, and it was good, but not great. One gripe though. Our waitress was just rude and plain bad. Probably one of the worst waitresses I've come across. She spoke poor english and looked like she's pissed off all the time. For a restaurant that puts such a heavy emphasis on presentation, they should probably hire a real professional waitress/waiter instead of hiring probably a family friend or something who just immigrated here.

        "review": "I decided to try Oishi for lunch. \u00a0When I saw that this restaurant was located on north Prospect, I expected it to be similar to other family-style restaurants in that part of town. \u00a0Instead, I found Oishi to be quite sophisticated; a restaurant that probably would have fit in comfortably with the nightlife of downtown Champaign. \u00a0The interior is furnished with black leather, glass artwork (of scandalously bare-chested geisha...?), and flat-screen TVs. \u00a0There was club music pumping in the background throughout my meal (kind of annoying/inappropriate for lunch?).As a fair warning for those \"foodie purists\" out there, this is not a traditional Japanese establishment, but an Asian fusion restaurant, much like KoFusion. \u00a0There are options for \"exotic\" fare (e.g., sushi, Thai red snapper) and also more familiar, conservative options (e.g., fried rice, General Tso's chicken). Unfortunately, I've only sampled the sushi here, so I can't comment on the quality of the stir-fry items. \u00a0My impression is that they take popular Asian dishes and \"elevate\" them with a few fancy techniques. \u00a0The presentation of dishes is quite impressive. \u00a0On my sushi plate, there was a small floral arrangement and an artistic drizzle of sauces (including some kind of Asian \"barbecue\" sauce and spicy mayonnaise). \u00a0The rolled sushi was compact, neat, and divided into manageable sizes. \u00a0The sashimi was cut beautifully, showcasing the color and texture of the fish. \u00a0I had no problem with the freshness of the fish, either.As part of the lunch combination, you're offered a salad and a choice of different soups (miso, wonton, and hot & sour soup). \u00a0The salad was standard (iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, etc.), but the ginger dressing deviated in an interesting way from the usual recipe (I think I detected a hint of grapefruit or other citrus...?). \u00a0The soups, while dished out in generous portions, were forgettable and bland.Overall, I found the experience to be lovely and enjoyable. \u00a0The service was professional and the food was quite good, especially in terms of presentation. \u00a0I'm sure I'll be back to dine here again soon.",

I've being to the restaurant hundreds of times and received good food and friendly service. However, the waitress who seats me on Friday, whom I never even met before and claimed to be working all the time insisted that I must follow her instruction and sit at some strange corner which is cold and refused my request for change in seat (which never ever happened in my experience at the restaurant), claiming that those seats are 'reserved' when I see no sign of 'reservation'. When I insisted to make a seat change, she showed great impatience and anger and tell me to ask manager. I left the restaurant immediately since I have no mood in eating anymore. The waitress totally ruined my evening. The worst waitress ever! She simply destroyed the reputation of such a good restaurant. I suggest the restaurant fire her immediately. Otherwise I won't go and will strongly discourage all my friends go and be treated terribly at the restaurant. If you really love the food there, which I agree to be fantastic, avoid Friday and Saturday, which is the time the terrible waitress claimed as 'always working on'.",

I have never seen such a poor excuse for management anywhere, she was RUDE and did not even try to explain things, she had no consistency in explanations and actually tried blaming her waitress for their problem. My family decided to meet here to have dinner one night. Unfortunately we found out how much they do not care for their customers. My mother in law purchased gift certificates for this place on-line and gave them to my wife and all her siblings as a Christmas present. We were all going to use these that night, not on one bill but we were all paying separate bills and were trying to use them individually. This apparently isn't allowed if you sit at the same table, but the manager said it would be OK if we sat at different tables. The manager then tried to tell us the only reason we couldn't use them was because the gift certificates have the same name on them, we explained that when you purchase them you cannot choose what name you put on them, its the name of who purchased them. To try to prove her point she whips out her iphone to show us a laundry service add from where my mother in law purchased the gift certificates. We explained that was completely different than a gift certificate to this place, then the manager actually stated \"your waitress didn't have the guts to explain this when you wanted to pay\", actually the waitress said it should be fine because we were paying separately. At that point the manager tried to make us feel bad because when we use the coupons \u00a0they loose money.... The only response to that was: So stop selling them!!! She even had some guy from the kitchen stalking our table while she attempted to make sense to us. The manager then said it would be OK to use the coupons, ran our bill, then decided against her first decision and re-ran our bill after voiding out the coupon. I will absolutely never darken their door again. I hope they lose all of their customers by running them off. Take my advice, don't buy a coupon to their place, if you do you may have to waste 45 minutes of your life dealing with the sorry excuse of a manager that was working. The worst part of it all was that they could have told us about this before we gave them our credit cards and we would have just paid.",

Sadly, this place was a disappointment, and at least we had one another as company to make a crummy restaurant fun. I will start with the absolute worst thing about this place...... THE SERVICE!! Seriously, who is in charge of hiring here? They really need to rethink their whole staff. I would seriously equate the service of this place to that of a Pizza Hut. The waiter took zero interest in us. I asked him if the risotto was vegetarian or if it was made with chicken stock... to which he literally said \"Well, there is no meat in it and it comes with vegetables, so it is vegetarian.\" Sorry, this does not make it vegetarian. He did not even offer to go and ask the chef like any good waiter or waitress would do. Needless to say, I did not trust him and went with the mushroom ravioli instead. Looking back, I actually wish we were the type of people who could have not tipped at all, that is how bad it was. Moving on, the food. Overall, the quality of the food was very meh. As I said, I got the mushroom ravioli, and my fianc\u00e9 got the Berkshire pork chop wrapped in pepper bacon and garlic mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of onion rings. The onion rings were a joke. Literally, I would prefer the onion rings from Portilo's any day. I mean, I would even take Burger King onion rings over these. The ravioli was fine, definitely nothing special. This place seems to think it is way fancier than it actually is. My ravioli came out with carrots and green beans on top.... just because you make your food look \"fancy\" does not mean it is good quality. In fact, my extra dressings were luke warm, and I had to remove them from the dish because it completely threw off the flavor. I tried the gralic mashed potatoes, and they were also fine, probably the same quality you would get a buffet. I absolutely did not feel as though the quality of the food lived up to either the descriptions on the menu, nor was it worth the prices they were charging. I think we ended up paying $50 for everything here, when in reality, it should have been much less based on the quality. The decor is very eclectic. Definitely nothing special and it just felt like we were sitting down at a chain restaurant. Nothing about this place really seems to match up. They are really trying to be something that they are not. I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone, especially if you are looking for a nice evening.",

I ordered one of the specials that day: duck breast with sauteed vegetables, mashed sweet potatoes and roasted pears (which by the way was almost identical to a dish I had at Escobar's in Champaign, see my review). I thought the duck was a little tough and overcooked, and the sides lacked flavor. Arnab had the Moroccan salmon: again the salmon was okay but the sides were disappointing. For the price (close to $20 per entree), I'm sure I can better dining options in town.Btw, the place is kind of hard to find.

The sandwich was fantastic, but the piece of salmon was very small. The salad was pretty good too, but priced like a dinner salad and sized like a side. The real differences in our experience were from the fact that the waitress kept forgetting things, from my brother's lemonade to an extra plate so we could share our food.

It seems \"airy\" in the dining room, with enough windows and space to feel like you aren't crushed by a dinner rush. I rather enjoyed sitting by the window looking out at the pond in the back, though I found myself having to strain to do so because the windows are higher than the chairs. The one thing I will also note is the noise level. For some reason, although I didn't notice it really loud in the restaurant, we were unable to hear each other across a round table. It was really odd, and I can't say I've ever experienced it dining before. We had to strain to hear one another, maybe the table was too big, or sounds bounced off the walls causing an unecessary reverberation, but whatever it is it was unsettling, and made enjoying each other's company nearly impossible.FOOD: Fair. I had the springtime risotto with chicken, and while the flavors of the risotto were pretty good (me being a risotto snob), I was dissapointed when it came to the table. I ordered a RISOTTO dish (with a side of chicken, which I expected to be sliced over the top) - what I got was about 1/2 cup of risotto, and a whole char-broiled chicken breast squashing my risotto. I also got a random smattering of carrots and green beans that I didn't order and shouldn't have been included, given the veg in my dish. The risotto, while decently flavored, was slightly under. My children each had the kid's pizza, and these were really good, actually.They were hand made, nice crusts, good cheese to sauce ratio, and pleasantly flavored, not like the usual frozen tasteless slop that many other restaurants usually send out for kids. It made me happy to see that the chef was thoughtful about younger patrons, and I'd probably return based on that alone.SERVICE: Meh... our server was an older female with long white hair that she didn't pull back, leaving me to wonder how much of it got into the food on any given night. She was slow to take our order, and I felt like slow to bring the food, but otherwise pleasant enough, and did a good job of keeping up with water and drinks.VALUE: Fair enough. Again, I felt like the risotto was overpriced some given the portion size, but a little portioning could fix this. Expect to pay around $20 per plate for adults, and most everything else I saw looked fresh, nicely made, and probably worth it.",

The complimentary bread was very good and featured a couple of different kinds, all good.For entrees, we had their Thai curry flavored Halibut (on special) and chicken, which came with rice and sauteed vegetables. They were both expertly cooked, pleasingly presented, and amply portioned. The tasty curry sauce was similar to a slightly spicy Panang, but was reduced to a perfect consistency for the dishes. \u00a0We both had leftovers. Their outdoor patio is really nice and looks over a pond and prairie area (that will soon be development, so enjoy the view while it lasts). The decor inside is also nice with original local artwork on the walls.The folks there were really nice and service could not be better. They let us bring our dog and gave us no jazz when she was less than perfectly behaved. They have a very nice wine list which, although not that large, has some very good choices at eminently reasonable prices. The selection of wines by the glass is superior. They also have a good beer selection, including Krusovice, which is fast becoming a new fave of mine.

We called and made a reservation, and I was very excited.First strike: I called early in the day to make a reservation for 8 people at 6:30 PM. I called several minutes ahead of time as a courtesy to let them know we would be arriving shortly (because it was a Friday night and I wanted to know if they were on schedule). I reiterated our number of guests and the time. When we arrived, our table was set up for the wrong number of people, and the table they chose was completely impractical for the special needs of some of our guests (which were divulged over the phone both times). There were 5 other tables dining in the restaurant. FIVE. There was no reason, especially after my phone call, that this should have happened. We waited around for changes to be made, which took longer than it should have. However, since we're all human, I shrugged it off and got ready for my meal.Second strike: We ordered drinks, and I can safely say they were the worst drinks we've ever had. Not one person at our table enjoyed their cocktail; they were overpriced, contained almost no liquor, and were improperly mixed. We stuck to (very overpriced) beer for the rest of the night.Third strike: When it came time to order dinner, we asked the waiter about some of the items on the menu. He seemed to know what 3 of the dishes were, and when we asked him some opinion questions, it became obvious that he only told us to pick these dishes because he was able to pronounce their names. He had NO clue what he was talking about, and we decided to take our chances by ordering a variety of dishes. I also ordered the shrimp cake appetizer.Fourth strike: I waited for said appetizer for 40 minutes. In that time two more tables arrived, but three left. Our waiter did not offer refills or check on our table while we waited, and by the time my appetizer showed up, I was about to start eating the basket the bread arrived in. They came closer with my plate, I could hear angels singing, and as soon as they set it down I deflated. I had two silver dollar sized cakes with an extremely large amount of greens on my plate. My husband and I each got three bites between the two cakes, and they were very small bites. I paid $10 for this?Fifth strike: Our meals came out within 5 minutes of our appetizer (sigh), and again the portion sizes were disappointing. My steak was cooked appropriately, but it was the only one at the table that was cooked correctly. My husband ordered the lamb shank, and it was tough and poorly seasoned. My mother in law had the lasagna, which was cold. The only person who enjoyed their meal was my sister, who ordered roasted chicken.Between the poor service, the inability to honor our reservation properly, the awful drinks, the long waits, and the bad food, I'm amazed that this restaurant is so well reviewed. The amount we paid for this awful meal makes it twice as bad. I will definitely never be back to this restaurant.

The dressing and strudel were excellent. \u00a0For dinner I ordered the crab cakes with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were good, but I was disappointed in the crab cake. I was hoping for jumbo lump, or at least lump crab, but it seemed to be all backfin. The seasoning was ok, but overpowered the sweet and brininess of the crab. My husband ordered the duck breast- which was very good, as was the rack of lamb with port reduction my mother ordered. Service was good, but plates were timed poorly- the potatoes and accompanying sauces (for the duck and lamb) were cold, indicating that the dishes weren't plated properly. All in all, a good meal, but not amazing.Have since returned to Milo's for dinner. I ordered Chicken in Pesto Cream Sauce over Penne, my husband ordered the Crusted Tilapia w/ Garlic Mashed Potatoes and a Side Veg. For starters we had salad and a salmon chowder. The chicken was very well cooked, but it was breaded and fried, which I think should have been mentioned on the menu- unless it's chicken parmesan, I assume chicken with pasta (esp w/ a cream sauce) will be grilled/sauteed. The flavor of the sauce was *excellent*- but the penne was overcooked. My husband's fish was well prepared, but he felt the batter was a bit on the bland side. It also did not look like Tilapia- it was a thick piece of fish, with big flakes, so I would have guessed it was cod, pollock, or hake- tilapia are thin fillets. The mashed potatoes weren't exceptional, but for a side, they were decent. The salmon chowder- more like a corn chowder with a BIT of salmon, was good, but not the best I've had. Again, our meal was very good, and certainly by C-U standards, great.... but I still wouldn't say the meal was exceptional.",

I've definitely paid this much before for a comparable amount of food, but that was at some of my favorite restaurants that make sure every detail is perfect. And everything at Destihl was good, but not perfect.Here's what we had:--Stuffed dates - These had a great sweet/salty/spicy balance, but the barbecue sauce was a bit too much and a little detracting.--Mustard-glazed chicken - The chicken itself was delicious, but there was too much mustard sauce. The fingerling potatoes and green beans were both good, but not well-seasoned. The dish also didn't come out super hot.--Espresso-rubbed steak - The steak was huge and cooked well, and it had great flavor. Not my favorite steak, but still good. --Bruleed banana pudding - They made this gluten-free for me by not having pie crust, and it was phenomenal. It was the star of the show! I am still dreaming of this.The interior of Destihl is very nice--what you'd expect at an upscale gastropub.

There are always some really interesting flavors going on and Destihl really does distinguish itself above its competitors, the other sort of new american or gastropub restaurants.Destihl does brew its own beer and it's generally pretty good, always a very reasonable price. You can also get growlers for like $20. Great deal. They generally have one of each type of brew and they're generally pretty solid brews. I got the Bela - Imperial Pilsner - which was great. Good, strong beer but very drinkable.This time I started with the Corn & Chicken chowder which has a bit of chipotle espresso BBQ sauce on top. Wonderful flavors, really was. Very delicate corn flavor mixed with the hint of bbq and given some weight from the just marginally creamy chowder. The soup was nothing short of phenomenal. Must Have.I then had the Farm & Field burger. Really interesting combination of flavors between the lamb and the bison within the patty and then it's topped with just a wonderful combination of delicious ingredients. Who would've thought that combining pesto, sun dried tomato aioli, havarti cheese, soy onions, etc on a burger would produce such an intriguing concoction of flavors!!

From \"Smile Politely,\" (Champaign-Urbana's online magazine) \"DESTIHL Restaurant & Brew Works of Champaign, Illinois, won a bronze medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado for its Strawberry Blonde Ale in the 'Fruit Beer' category.\"The menu has many options ranging from salads to burgers to pizza. I personally love the beer-battered asparagus and beer-battered fish and chips. My husband has ordered the fish tacos on one occasion and pizza on another. The fish tacos were okay. The pizza is good. They also have a gluten-free menu and a kids' menu. Even though we have never taken our 2.5 year old to a kids' restaurant, and she is used to dining with grown-ups in grown-up restaurants, it's nice that they accommodate young diners with crayons to color on the kids' menu. Even the most patient young foodie could use a quiet distraction while they wait. Glad we have this restaurant in the C-U. I highly recommend it.",

For dinner I had the Swordfish dinner. It has a very nice and spicy glaze and is served on a bed of arugula and other spiced veggies. Very impressive, very tasty, but it was a little small which the server told me ahead of time. Not the best choice if you are looking for a big meal, but a very good dish overall. My friend had the Pork rib and pulled pork dish with cole slaw and potatoes. I was very good, had a nice kick to it. Everything is served with a modern flair and a unique flavor profile. This is not your typical boring brew pub food. Very stylish. The atmosphere is nicer that most brew pubs and is great for a nice dinner out with friends. I am never disappointed at Destihl!!",

I have never tried these and I thought that These were amazing. The perfect blend of spicy, savory and sweet. I got the Weissenheimer Chicken. I have to compliment the chef on how juicy the chicken was. It was a big piece of chicken and not one bit dry.

It's often the gathering point for business events or company dinners, which brings a lot of patrons to this restaurant. There's a good selection of beer that's, judging by the brewing equipment in the restaurant, presumably brewed in-house (and maybe some off-site) as well as a decent menu showcasing modern American fare. \u00a0Usually, a drinking establishment that decides to start cooking ends up making subpar food, while a restaurant that makes good food has a lackluster beer selection. Of course, this isn't always the case, but I usually don't go to bars for their food, and restaurants for their beer. Destihl, however, strikes a good balance between the two camps. \u00a0I had a chicken pot pie when I went there, while my dining companion had stuffed peppers. Both were perfectly fine, but nothing to write home about. The menu is made up of conventional American dishes, but unfortunately nothing too unique. You'll find everything you want here for a great meal, but nothing that truly catches your eye. \u00a0Overall, the service was excellent, our waiter had insightful knowledge on the beer selections, and the atmosphere here was just right.

I wish I knew the waiters name because he went above and beyond to make sure we all had what we need. \u00a0It was fairly fast service as well for being as many of us as there were. \u00a0I liked the menu selection here to. \u00a0Lots of gourmet and different food items to choose from, not the same old stuff you see at most restaurants. \u00a0They have a unique twist to your average or popular dishes. \u00a0Pretty cool.Now on to the food.... They had me at beer battered jalape\u00f1o bacon! Omg it was delicious! We also tried the beer battered asparagus which was equally as good. \u00a0For my meal I got the green chile mac and cheese with pork. \u00a0It was good, I wish I would've ordered something with a bit more substance (not much meat in it) but I guess that was my own fault! The flavor of what I had was great though. \u00a0I also tried my moms stuffed pablano pepper which was great! I wish I would've gotten that. \u00a0Everyone seemed to love their food here. \u00a0Oh, and the carrot cake is TO DIE FOR! I highly recommend it, the pieces are as big, if not bigger, than my head! The prices were also fair. \u00a0I really enjoyed this place! Wish there was more places like this (for this same price range) around Schaumburg.",

They had a big beer, wine, cocktail, and martini menu. I tried a couple of different beers, and they were all really good for the most part. They also had 4 oz portion which was a great way to try different beers, and the 4 oz portion is surprisingly not priced proportionally any higher than its 12 oz counter part.

I went it's opening weekend and let me be clear when I say this rating is based on beers alone, I didn't get a chance to try the food yet!I'll start by saying that the atmosphere is really cool. It reminds me of a Blind Pig Brewery meets Seven Saints or something like that. They call themselves a gastro-brewery instead of a gastro-pub, which I think fits the bill pretty well. The place is divided up nicely with the bar being it's own area and a nicer looking restaurant on the other side. I have to say though, I was a bit surprised to hear that it's only open until 11, that doesn't seem wise for an area of town that's so reliant on the nightlife.As far as the beer goes, they had 18 on tap that were freshly made on the spot and they were pretty amazing. I was surprised to hear that they didn't have anything but their own brews available, and I worried about how my non-fancy beer fans felt, but then when I tasted their Champaign Blonde Ale, it was EXACTLY like a Bud Light. I think my favorite that I sampled was the Downstate Pale Ale, and the Raspberry Wheat Ale was a bit too much for me. But overall, I think they covered their bases pretty well.I definitely can't wait to come back and try the food (which I hear is truuuuly delicious) and give this place it's 5th and final star!UPDATE!So I went back and finally got to try the food. I believe I ordered the Swordfish, my boyfriend got the jambalaya and we both split some of the beer battered asparagus. I'll say right away the asparagus was the best part, which didn't surprise me because everyone raved about their appetizers, but I never heard much about the main dishes. My swordfish wasn't that great, to be honest, and I'm pretty easy to please. My boyfriend's jambalaya wasn't superb either, but then again, that's probably not the best thing to order at a place like this.All in all, everything was good, and a nice change from what's available downtown, but if I had one piece of advice, it would be stick to the beer and small plates!",

I got hungry waiting for my friend so I ordered the Ancho chips and dip. The chips were just okay but the vinegar and the dressings were really quite good. The habanero vinegar wasn't overpoweringly hot but had a nice kick and the ranch was more than just a ranch dressing. I had the bison burger because I haven't had bison meat in a while and it was just as good. The burger though, was all right the bison, slightly sweeter and less greasy than ground beef was good.

I noticed some people complained about the prices, but for the quality of food, this is really much cheaper than something comparable in the Chicago suburbs although the portions aren't exactly huge. But it's pretty in line with prices and portion sizes at other restaurants in downtown. The menu is quite unique for the area and similar to what you'd find in a lot of Milwaukee restaurants.I really enjoyed everything from the American Kobe burger to the Beer-battered cod. The textures and variety of flavors were great and not too salty. The sandwiches and soups were also pretty light and refreshing. I particularly enjoyed the tomato soup and corn & chicken chowder soups. The dessert choices were quite varied but i was so full I didn't have room for more than one. The stout ice cream sandwiches had a really nice stout ice cream between brownie circles. It was a perfect way to end the meal.Given the quality of cooking and good prices, I'll definitely be back here soon.Update: Upon visiting a few more times, I still think this is a good restaurants but there are a couple notes.The price complaints I see from some reviews may be due to the varying sizes of some dishes. For example, the thai mussels appetizer is quite a bit smaller than some other items although the prices are similar. Also, the chocolate cake is a giant portion compared to the bread pudding.I'm not a big fan of anything Asian themed I tried here as I found the flavors to be too strong. I prefer it to be more delicate although some patrons may appreciate the bold flavors. I wasn't a big fan of the pizzas either. They were large in size but the dough was too moist for me and I didn't like the flavor combinations I tried.I did like the teas I tried as they were high quality organic tea bags. The coffee is a mix of two Kenyan coffees with a full bodied flavor from their supplier in Bloomington served with fresh cream. The shrimp frittata comes with a generous amount of shrimp flavored with shrimp stock, probably the best frittata I've ever eaten. The cuban style pork sandwich was done well but not as legendary as other reviewers make it out to be. The Potts roast was also done well but not worth a special note. The potato crusted rainbow trout was done well with good presentation but I wish the portion size could have been a little larger. The dijon chicken was moist and flavored well but, the real star of the dish was the asparagus that was cooked and flavored excellently.The apple fritters dessert had crispy fritters but the toughness of the peel wasn't that appealing. If it were substituted with something like apple chips or churros, I probably would have enjoyed it more. If the goal is to keep an apple-like look, possibly fried colored dough is a better substitute. The chocolate cake is a whole pound with chocolate layering instead of cream. This was done well and not overly sweet, a very good choice for chocolate lovers. \u00a0The sour cherry bread pudding was done well, a little too sour for me but a solid choice. I would've preferred a couple elements to vary the texture inside but that might not fit the overall theme of the dish.",

Relaxed, but sterile and pretty much the exact opposite of the Blind Pig. Which oozes uniqueness from every wood poor.The service is fast, but they are not very interested in much. I want someone working at a brewpub to at least show interest in their products. Here it seems they want to shuffle you in and out with a ticket and some tips. Unimpressed on this front. The food is fairly bland and generic. Some pizzas, some steaks, some chicken, some seafood. A little of everything. They do nothing good, but nothing bad either.There is a wide variety of beers available. Including a cask mild, which I would have jumped at if I had seen it before leaving. The rest is about 14 taps in all styles. A blonde, hefeweizen, a scotch ale, a few stouts and IPAs (some imperial), lots of Belgian styles. \u00a0Though nothing is really that good, and some have obvious flaws.Overall, clearly the second best brewpub on the block. Almost the definition of average to me. The food does not really excite me either. I really can't see myself coming here to often over the many other great beer destinations and restaurants within walking distance. Though cheers for at least another brewpub option in town.",

Like so good hat he went there for lunch and dinner one day and then came back for brunch the next morning. After looking at the menu, how could I resist??So we went today for a late lunch (around 2:30) and found the place pretty much deserted. There were some people working in the bar who made eye contact with us but didn't come up to the host stand to seat us. So we waited. And waited. And finally a hostess came and brought us to a cavernous booth in the bar. Where we waited. And waited. And listened to awful terrible music (read: Dave Matthews Band)A female server came to get our drink orders and informed us that Michael would be our server. Ok, so the do team service, I'm on board with that. But Michael didn't come with our drinks. Someone dressed like a manager did. And Michael didn't take our food order. A woman who we later learned was a manager did. I think Michael maybe refilled our drinks? The first manager looking guy dropped off our apps. Here's the skinny on what we had:Beer battered bacon: this is worth a star. It was greasy but oddly delicious. Brussels sprouts: flavor was good but they were still pretty hard in the middle. Bacon Egg and Cheese Deviled Eggs: nothing to write home about. They were small and pretty smoky tasting.  For entrees, I ordered the fried egg BLT and my sister ordered the bison burger. My BLT was fine. Again, nothing to write home about. There was some sort of mustardy vinaigrette on the greens that was overpowering. And the egg could have been runnier. But another star goes to the fries which were hot and crispy and delicious. My sister ordered her burger medium and it came out completely well done. Like \"we think this bison is dead but let's burn it at the stake just to make sure it's really really dead.\" She decided to send it back and so we waited. And waited. And a brand new server (still not Michael) came by to check on us. She went back to the kitchen to have them make a new burger and left the old one so my sis could nibble on the fries. Her friendly attitude and apologies would have garnered another star, but I was SO put off when she came back to tell us that her manager wanted to let us know that she put the order in correctly and that the cooks are the ones who screwed up. Umm... Why wouldn't the manager come over herself to apologize? Or at least to check on us after the replacement came? And also, it is so not cool to throw your kitchen staff under the bus like that. All in all, Destihl has good bacon, inattentive staff, poor leadership, and too much desire to be \"cool.\" And where is Michael? My receipt says he was my server but I don't even know if I saw him, and I fear my tip went to someone who didn't do any work! I won't be back.",

        "review": "I have never been more disappointed in my gastronomic experience in Urbana-Champaign then this past weekend at Destihl \"Brewery\" (who knows if they even brew beer at this place). Having been to Destihl a handful of times before the abominable brunch I suffered through this past weekend I expected an experience somewhat similar to what most people describe here on Yelp. That being a friendly staff, and decent (perhaps even good) food at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, Destihl has suffered a complete drain of quality over the last few years. When it opened, Destihl offered hot, quality food served my intellectual and friendly servers who were happy to be working in one of Champaign's better restaurants. Each time I dined at Destihl I noticed the quality of the food, the quality of the service, and the quality of the dining experience was eroding away. This erosion culminated with the brunch a group of friends and I endured this past Sunday. I say endured because our meal lasted from 12:30p.m. until 2p.m. The absurd elongation of our meal was not caused by entrancing, deep conversation amongst old friends, or by laggard mastication of our fantastic food. The epoch that was our brunch at Destihl was caused solely by the complete ineptitude and incompetence of our server, the manager, and Destihl as an establishment. To begin, our waiter spoke to our group at a volume slightly above \"whisper\". He seemed to not care at all that our decently sized group would likely give him his biggest tip of the day. One could almost assume our waiter was indentured to Destihl and taking our orders, suggesting menu items, and assuring that we were taken care of was a reminder of the chains that confined him. After taking our orders, three of which were simply \"eggs, bacon, and potatoes\" (not worth the $10), our group set off on the marathon that ninety minutes later would end in us getting our food. In total our group would watch at least seven other parties wait for a table, be placed near us, taken care of by the same subjugated waiter, eat, pay their bill, and depart. After the fourth group who had arrived after us was served before us, a member of our group called the manager over. At this point we had spent 45 minutes ordering and waiting. By this point the waiter had been unable to provide any information about our meal besides, \"they are still working on it, should be out soon.\" This information was decrypted by the members of our group through the reading of his lips and not by any sort of audible understanding between him and ourselves. We hoped the manger could provide us with additional information, this would prove to be a fool hearted assumption.The manager assured us he would check on our order and would return shortly. After three more groups consumed their meals, paid their tabs and departed, and another half an hour passed, the manager had not returned. At this point our group decided that if our food did not arrive by 1:45 PM. we would simply stand up, leave, and eat fast food. Finally, at 1:43p.m., 1 hour 13 minutes after arriving our meal was served. Destihl was relatively empty when we arrived and continued to be throughout our meal. Yet, our food took longer to cook than the run time of the original 1931 version of Frankenstein. If you have been to Destihl for brunch you know none of the menu items are difficult to cook, they are largely egg dishes accompanied by breakfast meats, french toasts, or a hot sandwich. Since this experience ended I have wondered what took so long for our food to be cooked and leave the kitchen. I have surmised that the reasons for our hour and a half endeavor are a product of the poor quality that now defines Destihl. First, our waiter did not care about us nor did he serve as our representative in the kitchen. Second, the cooks clearly lost track of our order because some food came out steaming hot, some came out only partially complete, and the rest came out lukewarm (presumably having spent an hour under a heat lamp). Finally, the manager who never returned to our table and only after being called over again offered excuse after excuse before finally saying, \"Well, I am sorry.\"To anyone who has invested the time to read my review, thank you. To anyone who has spent the time to read my review and still intends to go to Destihl even after I have made clear my utter frustration and disappointment, I wish you the best of luck. To conclude, my friends and I will never eat at Destihl again and I look forward to the restaurant that will soon replace it.",

Some of us would like to actually taste our food without leaving with high blood pressure. The Thai chicken wings were salty. The meatloaf was salty and dry. The Thai fried chicken is a good concept, but again it was salty. My chicken was under cooked. The waitress was apologetic and promptly got it re-fried (nice service). Although I didn't get to try them, the burgers and pizzas looked pretty good (but if you're just looking for burgers and pizzas there are much better places). The chocolate cr\u00e8me brulee was a travesty! No resemblance to cr\u00e8me brulee in terms of taste or texture. Extremely unpleasant! However, there is something on the menu that is truly mind blowing! BEER-BATTERED BACON! WOW! So crispy and thick! Must have! Bottom line, if you're here for drinks, order the beer-battered bacon and maybe burgers and pizza. Everything else on the menu is mediocre at best. Oh, and don't forget your blood pressure medication. You'll need it!",

Honestly, my biggest pet peeve with Destihl is their attempt at trying to create elevated food that just come off as tacky. For instance when I split their quesadilla appetizer they proudly touted it was deconstructed. That meant the appetizer consisted of some tortillas with melted cheese and a side of so-so grilled steak. Give me a break- I've had some cleverly deconstructed items before and that was not the case here. They do a similar thing with smores (e.g. the marshmallows come pre-melted). Tacky might be a strong word but to serve things in ways that are poorly executed and actually make eating your meal less enjoyable and more complicated in an attempt to seem high-end is pretty tacky.",

He skated the *annoying* line very closely, never crossed it though so hurrah.Food got thumbs up from us: Med. pizza (really delicious and big for $9), Bison burger (fries were a hit), jambalaya, and dopple chop (it was good, but pricey at $20 for what is received).

My husband and I have been here a few times, and we both really like the potato croquettes (mmm, chimichurri) and the marinated cucumber salad. Both have a spicy bite -- definitely recommended. The rest of the food is okay. Pizzas are decent, the salads seem to rely a lot on the dressings, similarly so with the sandwiches. Service is good and friendly, although can come down a little on the overwhelmingly chatty side. Still, in a place as big as this one, it's nice to not feel like you've gotten lost or abandoned.Unfortunately, I can't recommend much else. The design and marketing of Destihl gives off a very artisanal vibe, particularly in their choice of \"craft beer,\" but their beers are at best uneven and at worst anemic shadows of what they could be. Most recently, I was disappointed in the pumpkin porter, which sounds like it should be layered and spicy and complex. Mostly, it was bitter and I could only taste the pumpkin if I really thought about it. I've felt similarly about all of their beers that I have tried, although a few are okay (the Hefeweizen, the Tripel). I want to be seduced by the delicious descriptions (and oh, they DO have a good writer), but I just can't.This place reads to me as a large chain that wants to be a small, careful, art-and-ingredient-driven restaurant, but it doesn't get there.

The decor is surprisingly upscale - really cool use of natural stone and wood. HUGE shame they didn't open with their patio ready to go, but when I inquired they said it was in the plans to open the patio soon.The beers (I tried 5, yup 5) were decent - not world-class, but decent. My favorite purely for summer drinkability was the Champaign Blonde, but I am admittedly not into dark beers at all, and there are PLENTY of dark ones and heavier Begian-style ales which I didn't try.The menu looked surprisingly interesting, (I was expecting burgers and pretzels), and between us we tried the pickled cucumber salad, the tuna carpaccio, the strawberry salad and the warm salmon and potato salad. All four dishes were winners, although the small plates ARE really small (which is exactly what we wanted). The entrees are MASSIVE for the price, and look like they are high quality meals, but I'm glad we saw how big they were before we ordered one!Service was excellent from beginning to end.The desserts also looks amazing, but I was too full to try. As a gay couple it was nice to feel comfortable and that there was a real mix of clientele - I was scared it was going to be exclusively Olive Garden-goers, but there were some hipsters, some queens, and some students as well as your typical 'casual-dining' crowd.Can't wait for the patio to open, but believe me, there will be a serious wait time on those tables - be prepared!",

My friend and I arrived a little after 7 on a Friday night and was told the wait would be about 40 minutes since we didn't have reservations. No problem. After only about 20-25 minutes our pager buzzed, so score! So far so good. Our server was really nice and attentive, nothing negative to say about him. However, the food is another story.We started with the cheese curds for an appetizer. And these were awesome, plus they give you a lot. The only part of the meal that really stood out, sadly. I'd had my eye on the strawberry goat cheese salad, so I got that and split the pesto goat cheese pizza. The salad had a lot of potential with all the seemingly good ingredients, but was just off. The spinach tasted wrong and it would have been much better with mixed greens. The \"strawberry\" part of the salad consisted of maybe three tiny pieces and the goat cheese wasn't even very good. It mainly was made up of mandarin oranges and ill-tasting spinach.I'm not a huge fan of wood-fired pizza (I prefer almost any other type of crust). My friend and I split a pizza, but I saw plenty of people putting one away all by themselves. It is very thin. The toppings were ok, but I didn't like how the goat cheese was in big globs instead of spread over the whole pizza.We left without getting dessert, but I saw a few and they are possibly the biggest desserts I've ever seen anywhere. This isn't a good thing. Probably 3-4 people should be splitting on dessert, but I'm guessing that doesn't happen that often. So just be aware if you do order that piece of cake.Besides the service, the other positive is the price. Everything is fairly cheap. But that coincides with the quality, so just beware.",

Ideally, I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did, but it was what it was. I started off with some of the home brews. I did the the little 4 oz guys and out of the four I tried, I liked three enough to drink again (the Belgian ale was a bit too hoppy for my liking). At $1.25 each (or $5 for the 4), I don't mind one I didn't like.Next I went with the beer-cheese soup. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT. It was amazingly good. Also, at my table were some cheese curds and I will dare say that these curds were the finest curds I have ever eaten (and I've had them in Wisconsin too). For my entree, I went with the bison burger which was flavorful - although I will echo the review who noted that their meat was overcooked - and I appreciated that fries were included. The fries were awesome - shoestring style and were not oversalted, but weren't seasoned improperly either (just right!).For dessert it was baked apples with butter pecan ice cream. It was wildly decadent and irresponsibly delicious. The service is not awful but you can tell that the servers are still getting their feet wet. No worries though. The food was totes worth the wait.

If you are a craft beer enthusiast you should definitely stop in. It is definitely worth the short drive even if you are staying by the highway in Motel Hell. I arrived early and was seated promptly at a table in view of a big screen TV near the bar area. My server was knowledgable and attentive. I had a flight of three craft beers, guided by my server. As an appetizer, I had the mac and cheese. Loved it and managed to avoid eating it all so I could take some back to my room. For an entree, I had the salmon over a bed of roasted vegetables. This was also quite good. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse, which is accented by a topping of cinnamon-coated maple bacon (amazing) and mint. This was also good but could be more chocolatey, IMHO. If I lived in the area I would dine here regularly.

At the end of dinner he returned to being our server but also bartender so we were basically ignored. Very weird service.We tried 11 of the 14 beers they make. I personally like really hoppy beers, but alas I can't remember the names of the ones I liked. For appetizers we ordered the chorizo stuffed dates, which were AMAZING! We also ordered lamb meatballs. I love anything with goat cheese so both of these appetizers were right up my alley. In the past, I have also gotten beer battered asparagus which is also super delicious.Originally, I ordered the pesto and goat cheese pizza but unfortunately it was very soggy and my plate was drenched in grease. Even the server commented that it was excessively soggy. I sent it back, which is something I NEVER do. I then ordered the flat iron quesadillas from the appetizers as my dinner.

I was immediately impressed with the vibe of the place - very hip, and something you would expect to find in any major city's downtown. The beer list was posted on a board above the bar and was HUGE for a local microbrewery. Where I expected to find 8-10 local beers supported by a smattering of other regional brews, the list of beers brewed in house was closer to 20-25. As I had never been to Destihl, I asked the bartender to select 4 beers for me to sample (this is typical practice for me -- a good bartender will ask the right questions and figure out what you like). He started by asking if I wanted darker or lighter beer, and then asked me about some different flavor profiles. \u00a0After a few questions, he came back with four delicious beers. \u00a0I tried the Roadblock British Red Ale, Black Angel Stout, Deadhead Double Red, and Antiquity Rye Wine. \u00a0All were really awesome.I was very pleased with the bartenders knowledge of the beer, the fast friendly service, and the atmosphere in general.Next time I'm in town this is DEFINITELY a place I plan to return, and hopefully next time I'll get to order some food as well.",

Portions are fairly generous (not so much with brunch items), and the price fits the quality of ingredients and preparation. The staffing is good, service is timely, and the decor is charming. The craft beers made on site are wonderful. Try a series of 4 ouncers to build your own tasting. The flavor profiles given on the brew menu seem so far to have been accurate.For appetizers, I recommend the shrimp ceviche (technically a \"small plate\") and the stone oven pretzels (you get two, with cheese and spicy honey mustard dips). I've tried one soup, the corn and chicken chowder, which was very good, nice SW pepper flavor without overwhelming the chicken. We've had sandwiches and entrees, from burgers to steak, and it's all been really delicious. The food is in the American Contemporary Casual style -- better than Houlihan's at the i-Hotel in our opinion.The only bad experience we've had with the food has been the cedar plank brie dessert. It was badly prepared (the brie wasn't even room temperature) and either the recipe was off or the honey-chili sauce was made incorrectly, because it was completely unbalanced and unpalatable. The smoke flavor reacted poorly with what was on the plank, too. We took the brie home (a big piece) and cut off the rind to eat the middle later, but it still tasted of rank sauce and smoke. We did not go back to the restaurant for a couple of months because of just how bad this was. \u00a0I wrote the general manager and he was good about it, offering to review the recipe and preparation with the lead chef. Since returning to Destihl, we've had good experiences again -- the place is consistent, a fun place to socialize, and a nice addition to CU's restaurant scene.",

They profess their best appetizer are the cheese curds (which are good) but the best of the lot has to be the Potato croquettes. I have had the beer-battered asparagus as well which changed my taste buds liking towards asparagus! I am a vegetarian and its extremely difficult to find a good vegetarian burger, so i was skeptical to order that (most places have burnt, bitter black bean patty!!) but they had one of the biggest veggie burger I have seen. The patty had rice, carrots, ginger and a few other veggies blended with the beans making it really delicious filling. The only vegetarian entree they have is the Stuffed Poblano Peppers, which was excellent. The staff is extremely courteous (sometimes more so than needed) and are very keen to entertain you. A few negatives are, the beer selection is great but is limited. I expect a brewery to have all their beers available (except the seasonal's, obviously) but they seem to rotate their beer. Even though the beer tastes good, I would cut some points for the spread of it. Another thing would be the place is unable to substitute any of the meat based dish with a vegetarian option which is a turn off if you are a vegetarian. P.S.

When we arrived, Andrew had a reserved table set aside, candles, wine glasses and the first bottle of wine complimentary. \u00a0Meeting us at the front he personally welcomed us to the restaurant and lead us to our table, and then passed us along to out waiter Vincent. This young man kept a keen eye on our table and made sure our wine glasses were replenished. \u00a0The food was excellent but an afterthought to the service we received.Thanks Andrew!",

The appetizers were so-so. \u00a0We tried potato croquettes and beer battered bacon. \u00a0The croquettes were run-of-the-mill, but good nonetheless. \u00a0The bacon was interesting, but certainly not a taste sensation.The main course were pretty variable. \u00a0My wife ordered the shrimp and grits - which was far too overpriced for such a meager portion. \u00a0Though, it was fairly tasty. \u00a0I ordered a Brewmaster's pizza which was very good.The main reason Destihl loses a star is the speed with which we received our drinks order. \u00a0It must have taken about 15 minutes after ordering for us to receive our drinks. \u00a0Eventually, we were informed of the backup at the bar. \u00a0I expect better though.Also, unrelated to my rating, there appeared to be a large number of employees standing around at the greeting station watching other employees working. \u00a0This could be training, then again, it could be the reason some of the food items are so expensive for the product!",

Their heffeweissen is really excellent. The apricot brew actually tastes like apricot; I tend to like fruity beers, and this one stood out to me. Their cocktails are also really, really good. I had the sake lemon drop and was not disappointed. Appetizers: Hands down, no contest, their beer-battered asparagus takes the gold. Its a lighter batter, more like a very gentle tempura than a \"fried chicken\" type fry. The honey-whatever sauce they serve with it is incredible, and they serve a grilled lemon with it that you probably aren't supposed to eat but tastes like candy so do it anyways. The shrimp ceviche is nothing to write home about. The shrimp skewers entree was tasty and well seasoned, but if you came with a big appetite, it might not be the choice for you. Their portions (one of the things I like most about Desthil) are reasonable and not out of this world for most of the main dishes. My boyfriend wasn't totally full when he left, but comfortable. The thai steak salad is incredible! I like a little spice, and this definitely had that! It's not big, but its delicious. Their pizzas are also fabulous, if a little salty. You can't complain that they underseason like some places in downtown Champaign. The seabass dish (I think it was a special) was definitely worth it. They do their cubans right; their mustard is homemade I think and really rounds it out. Overall, loved it. Decently priced for what you get, and you get a great night out!",

But this convenience is off-set by the depressingly overblown chain aesthetic, here manifesting as a too-self-conscious effort to seem \"on trend\" with both gastro pubs and microbreweries (witness, for instance, the giant prop barrels by the front door) while failing to capture the particular qualities of either. The \"artisan food\" was as mediocre as expected from this self-described \"gastrobrewpub TM.\" We ordered pizzas as appetizers for the table; \"stone oven\" seems to be a euphemism for \"toaster oven.\" The crusts were uniformly thin, but creepily so, without bubbling or crispness; the undersides were barely cooked. I suspect pre-formed frozen dough, by the taste and all-too-regular texture. The generous toppings were not supported by the crust, making each slice limp and increasingly wet. We also ordered the deep-fried asparagus, but I refrained -- the asparagus looked both too thick (these stalks were almost hot-dog-sized in circumference!) and too greasy.One of our dinner companions warned us against ordering burgers; on her last visit, her medium rare burger was burned black on one side (and was not at all medium rare). She guessed that the cooks went outside for a smoke and forgot to flip the burgers, but generously wondered if it had just been a long night for them in the kitchen. In an attempt to heed her advice, I tried to order the grilled and stuffed pasta without olives, but the waiter told me that the olives \"are already mixed in.\" I took that to mean that the pasta is made in a giant vat ahead of time (here I imagined a big plastic tub covered in Saran wrap in a walk-in freezer), and grilled to order, which didn't sound all that appetizing. Instead, I ordered the veggie burger (black beans and rice), and my g.f. the Kobe burger, medium rare. Both arrived with one black, charred side; her burger was well-done, ruining the meat. (Why eat Kobe beef if it's just going to be burned to a crisp?) My veggie burger was unremarkable, and my pile of shoestring fries had been overcooked in the fryer, and served to me lukewarm to cold -- totally inedible. I nibbled on two and then had to stop. Cold grease, ugh.I'd much rather order a burger and fries from Steak 'n' Shake, where you know what you're getting for the money. Overall, Destihl was a big \"no way.\" I will strenuously avoid coming here again!",

Two of my friends and I wandered in on a weekday night while looking for a place to eat at in downtown Champaign. The restaurant was relatively full for 7pm on Thursday, so I'd imagine there may be a wait on weekend nights. Beers = good. I think we tried 4? The strawberry blonde ale on tap was a clear favorite for us. Both their beer and dinner menus took awhile for us to look at. I was expecting traditional pub-style food, but their offerings far exceeded that.We started off with the deviled egg appetizer and the beer battered bacon appetizer. Both were very good- the beer battered bacon is a MUST. Jalapeno bacon in a tempura-like beer batter coating topped with a drizzle of maple chipotle glaze?! Yes please! When it came to our table, we slowly stopped talking and watched our plate of bacon descend in front of us. Like it came down straight from heaven. We didn't even realize we stopped talking and didn't remember what we were talking about until the bacon was gone..My friends got the jambalaya and the prosciutto-wrapped meatloaf. I really only tried part of the super tasty andouille sausage corn muffin that came with the jambalaya, as I was working on my full slab of beer-braised ribs (I gave one rib each to my friends to try though). They were perfect. Orders of magnitude better than Black Dog's ribs. I'm not sure whether or not that's a fair comparison since it's different cooking styles, but the texture of Destihl's ribs was absolutely perfect- tender, falling off the bone, but not annoyingly so.. The flavor was great also, as it tasted lovely by itself and did not need to be hidden behind sauce although the chipotle espresso bbq sauce it came with was also very tasty. My friends and I agreed that I \"won\" dinner since I ordered the best dish. My only qualm was that my shoestring fries were a little soggy and not as crispy as I would have preferred. But that's very minor.We were all pretty full, but could not pass up dessert. Like the rest of their menus, the dessert menu had a lot of tasty-sounding options. After some rock/paper/scissors, we ended up ordering the stout ice cream sandwiches which is more like four round brownie patties a la mode. But by all means, if you really wanted to, I guess you could try to eat it ice cream sandwich style. The alcohol in the chocolate stout ice cream wasn't very strong. Both the ice cream and the brownies were stellar. My friends especially loved the brownies. I was wondering what they did with the remaining brownie part after cutting out the rounds (to, you know, save waste if need be), and our waitress told us that the remainder is used for their chocolate martini? Maybe I'll check that out next time. Oh, and also, our waitress was very nice and friendly too. Overall, good service, clean place, nice decor.. everything was great. After tips, came out to ~$30/person, but actually filling up me + two guys \u00a0does require a bit of food and drink. I'm already trying to think of when I will return to try the kobe burger..",

Overall, I would never consider going back. I can find a better steak sandwich for a lot less at a number of different area restaurants. Coincidentally, I spoke to a friend about my experience weeks later when Destihl came up in conversation, only to find out that she had the exact situation happen to her when she visited Destihl.

Strongly infatuated: \"he became besotted with his best friend's sister\".2. Intoxicated; drunk.Now, I am currently the first definition of besotted, with Destihl. I LOVED my visit. I went with Mr. Husband and a Very Close Friend (VCF) before seeing a movie at the Art Theater. Upon leaving, I may have been the second definition of besotted. (Just kidding, I only had one beer. I swear, my Yelp reviews make me sound like an alcoholic sometimes.)We went on a Monday evening around 6. We were seated right away. Mr. Husband and I had never been there, and we were surprised how big the restaurant actually is - it doesn't look that big from the outside. Our waiter came over right away and gave us a nice little menu introduction. I don't know why they've made a restaurant based on the things I personally like, but they did - I wanted EVERYTHING on the menu. Seriously. I haven't had such a hard time deciding on what to order for quite some time. VCF and I decided to split a small plate and an appetizer, so we got the 'House Olives' and the Bacon, Egg & Cheese deviled eggs. For my meal, I got the beer & cheddar soup and the spinach salad. VCF got the bison burger, and Mr. Husband got a special item, a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.Food: Very good, but to be honest, it *could* have been better. If Yelp let me give 4.5 stars, I would've. Everything was solid, but there were a couple things that might just push it over the top. For instance, the house olives small plate? It was agreed that it could be improved by serving the olives pre-chopped, not whole - sort of a mix between an olive salad and a tapenade. The deviled eggs were good, but the yolk was just a bit stiffer than I would've liked. The beer & cheddar soup was yum, but the scallions would have been a little better more finely sliced. The spinach salad was good, but the maple in the maple jalapeno bacon dressing was a little too sweet, and overpowered the other good stuff (grilled portabella mushroom? hell yes.) Another reason I'm torn: I love that they use ingredients from local places when possible, and have put an emphasis on sustainable farming. I'm all for buying locally and supporting small farms and businesses. On the other hand, the way it's flaunted just strikes me as a tad pretentious. Personal bias, but still.Service - Another ALMOST 5 stars. My only issue with our waiter was that he was TOO attentive. Really friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu, gave good recommendations, was able to tell us what HIS favorites are (it drives me crazy when waiters have no idea what's good on the menu.) However, he came by every 5 minutes or so. I always have mixed feelings about that. I like a server who is *there* when I need a water refill or a new fork, etc, but coming by too often just breaks up the conversation. Ambiance - Very cool. Very big-city. I like it. I also like that it's BIG. Ample room between tables. We chose a booth, and it was perfect. The noise level is ideal - quiet enough to talk at a normal level, loud enough that it doesn't feel like everyone in the area can hear what you're saying. Dessert - I can't tell you the last time I ordered dessert after dinner! That NEVER happens! (I actually can tell you, it was at my mom-in-law's birthday dinner in early October.) But VCF knows how to sweet-talk me into sweets (heh), and our waiter was VERY convincing when telling us about the stout ice cream sandwiches, which feature a housemade chocolate ice cream made with their own stout, served on chocolate brownies. Oh. Mah. Gah. SO GOOD. The stout ice cream was phenomenal. The dessert consists of two sandwiches, so you get four brownies and two scoops of ice cream. This would be great to \u00a05 out of 5 stars for the dessert!! Price - Another 5 out of 5 stars. I was expecting that I'd have one entree and a beer. We ended up with a ton of food! For $38.77 before tip (I saved my receipt!), we got: -A soda-A 12 oz. beer - the Malius Apple Blonde Ale - so good!-House Olives app-Spinach salad-Soup-Bacon cheeseburger special-1/2 of the stout ice cream sandwichesSo while I can't yet give Destihl a 'best of the best' rating, I'm definitely a fan, and certainly willing to give it another few tries. I don't want to deter anyone from going here, because my visit was truly enjoyable. I'm already planning to permanently take Jim Gould out of my date-night lineup and replace it with Destihl. I just want to acknowledge that there is some room for improvement. I think with a tiny bit of tweaking, Destihl could easily be one of the top restaurants in C-U.",

I couldn't get the Yelp App to check me in so I could upload my pic of the tastiest stout I've ever had, so you are just going to have to trust me on its delicousity. I tried a taster (4oz for $1.50) of their berry weiss beer and it was a little too much berry for me, but if you like that kind of thing, you will love Destihl's take on it: the flavors of sweet and tart bounce back and forth dynamically as you sip. A companion loved their IPA, lauding the freshness and the spicyness of the hops.The food is as good as anywhere else downtown. My table ordered the portabello sandwich which was really hearty and came with kettle chips with a touch of seasoning and Destihl's Kobe burger, which is served on a fancy bun I did non recognize and stacked with thick jalepeno bacon, bleu and white chedar cheeses, pickles, and comes with the best steak fries I've ever tasted. That burger is about the same price as Farren's and the verdict was it was just as good, if not better, owing to the extra special toppings. Destihl's fries are thick badasses with the skin on and huge flecks of kosher or sea salt and were both perfectly crispy and cooked the whole way thru. Those are served with their balsamic vinegar (and expresso bean?) barbecue sauce that is unlike any I've ever had. As good as the kettle chips are, I highly recommend you sub in for the steak fries (though I saw some gorgeous piles of sexy shoestring fries served with other dishes, giving me one more reason for a quick return).Another reason for a quick return is the very impressive menu. Vegetarian will have no problem here, nor will the health-concious. They have a wide and deep menu spanning from American classic pub fare to trendy fusion dishes usually found only in more expensive restaurants. Prices were not exceedingly low, however value is good. I did not see their spirits or wine menus, but the lineup behind the bar bodes well for those not in the mood for beer.This place takes the best of Boltini's, Seven Saints, the Pigs, Radio, and Bacaro and serves it up in a killer setting with great \u00a0modern ambiance.

I've tried the seared scallops over curried mashed potatoes and the thai half chicken. The scallops were hardly seared and the potatoes were waaaaay over salted. The chicken on the other hand was far under spiced and seasoned. I will say their beer battered jalepeno bacon is delicious but deep fried food is pretty hard to screw up. Overall the prospect of having a modern american restaurant with an eclectic menu in the CU area is a great one, but a bit more attention to detail would greatly help Destihl.",

Luckily for me I had not been highly anticipating the opening of Destihl. The beers were good enough. There were about a dozen to choose from so if you drink beer at all, you should be able to find one you like. The night we went in we were given free 2oz samples of as many of the beers \u00a0as we wanted to try. I tried the Belgian, Strawberry Blonde and Raspberry Wheat, Champaign Blond and Frankengluten - good flavors, but none will be appearing on my all-time favorites list. The Frankengluten was interesting and worth a try if you are adventurous. Our waiter was nice and attentive enough but could not properly give drink recommendations since he was not old enough to drink. I thought this strange since, clearly, patrons are going to want to know about the beer. The food... I had the brie and portabello sandwich with chips. The chips were average and the sandwich was bland. That's honestly about the best I can say. My dinner partner said his steak salad was excellent and it looked fresh and crisp, but I can't vouch for the taste. We split the beer battered asparagus and that was by far my favorite item. I will probably go back at some point for another try. The pizza and a desserts sounded like they may have potential.Second visit 8/27/11: Finally tried the pizza (pesto and goat cheese) and still really no change in my review. Nice wait staff but the food does not overly impress. You do receive a large quantity of food for the price. Although, for me, quantity does not trump quality.",

\u00a0I changed my order to salmon at the waiter's recommendation. \u00a0Finally a manager appears and delivers the Salmon stating \"this is cooked to the chef's perfection.\" \u00a0The manager slither's off like a snake before I even touch the salmon. \u00a0Without cutting into the salmon, It was obvious that this fish was too raw. \u00a0My family had finished eating and after an hour and a half wait with no food, no appetizers, and a chef that I was now convinced can not cook at all, I ordered a Greek Salad. \u00a0This salad looked like someone threw the ingredients on my plate. \u00a0No order, presentation was horrible. \u00a0The dressing was red oil. \u00a0This dressing did not taste like greek dressing at all. \u00a0I ate the salad in disbelief that this place can not even prepare a good salad. \u00a0Our ticket was once again adjusted but this experience left a sour taste in my mouth. \u00a0I e-mailed the general manager and COO for the company and am awaiting a reply. \u00a0I would recommend no one go to this restaurant. \u00a0Seated across the street is Ko Fusion, an amazing restaurant. \u00a0This restaurant is too close for comfort for DESTIHL as this is where I will be seated watching DESTIHL's doors close for good if they do not find a chef that can cook the menu that was created.EDIT: \u00a0Less than 12 hours after my e-mail, I received a phone call from the general manager. \u00a0He was very kind and appologized. \u00a0More than this he listened. \u00a0He was kind and acknowledged that my concerns were valid. \u00a0He stated over and over again that there are no good excuses. \u00a0Humiliy allows for growth and I hope that this general managers humility induces change that produces solid growth.In March 2013, My husband and I used compensation cards to return. \u00a0The following is my email to the manager of destihl.I e-mailed back in October regarding a disappointing dinner and service that my family I experienced at Destihl Champaign. \u00a0We received compensation cards and returned tonight in order to assess if the service and food improved. \u00a0Our server was once again phenomenal, but the food was less than stellar. \u00a0My husband and I both ordered the swordfish, which were once again not cooked properly. \u00a0The swordfish were dry and over cooked, even upon reorder. \u00a0I guessed by the drying of the fish that a meat thermometer was used to assess if they were cooked properly, which in my opinion is an amateur error. \u00a0I then ordered a small portion Greek salad due to my hunger, my husband did not order one and we were charged for both. \u00a0I then ordered a gluten free Mediterranean pizza and my husband, a bone in ribeye. \u00a0My pizza could not possibly have been gluten free because within seconds, I felt sick and bloated and my husband's ribeye was cooked unevenly and dried out! \u00a0Most likely another piece of meat fallen victim to the meat thermometer. \u00a0With a history in restaurant service and cooking, I was appalled that we were charged for the salads and the pizza and were virtually comped nothing for the less than stellar food that we received. \u00a0Please do not send us any more compensation cards as we will not be returning, but I wanted to let you know that we are completely dissatisfied with ALL of our experiences at Destihl Champaign.",

Limited drink availability to what they perceive as \"authentic,\" and the first two I tried to order they didn't have the ingredients for. A disappointing start, for sure. The menu is largely English traditional (bangers, Americanized shepherd's pie, etc)We started with the \"Irish\" nachos because it made me giggle and I like corned beef. Most of the \"meat\" was just wads of fat and they were so greasy that it dripped off the chips as you picked them up. The couple of dry chips we found weren't too bad.I got the fish and chips which, literally, developed a pool of grease in the bottom of the basket. You have to request salt/pepper/ketchup since the tables the so tiny, I guess. I finished one of three small fillets before I just couldn't do it.

The drinks- They have a decent beer selection, but I wouldn't go back for that. \u00a0What I would go back is for their mixed drinks. \u00a0They have a nice drink selection and do a great job making them. \u00a0They take their time and make them right with some semi-advanced techniques. \u00a0Although the bartenders sucked as waiters/waitresses (see spoon story above), they were great bartenders. \u00a0I would easily give this place 4 or 5 stars when it comes to drinks.Will I come back? \u00a0Maybe, but I will not order food here again. \u00a0It is a shame since this is the only Irish Pub in Champaign/Urbana. \u00a0No, Murphy's does not count as an Irish Pub or anything. \u00a0Using a green shamrock and an Irish name doesn't make a bar an Irish Pub.",

We waited almost an hour for our entrees to be served.When our food arrived it was quite tasty (or maybe I was just starving by then) and the portions were plentiful. The Gouda macaroni and cheese was very good.Besides the food preparation being really slow it was way too loud! The place isn't that big. When it's packed with people all trying to talk at the same time it's loud. Even with the sound level uncomfortably high, management still feels its necessary to crank the sound system up to a level making it impossible to hold a conversation.The food is good, but the environment makes it impossible to enjoy your meal!",

Why may you ask...1. My wife got a dragon roll. It was the saddest dragon roll ever. Thinly sliced fish that had a very off color, not vibrant like you would expect and the roll itself was almost falling apart. Check the photos for yourself2. I got the chicken teriyaki with rice. Someone needs to check what the difference is with teriyaki and soy sauce. It felt like chinese stir fried chicken bits. Most japanese restaurants will not dice up the chicken into little cubes and then stir fry it in soy sauce. There was no sweet taste you would expect with real teriyaki sauce and this cost 17.95.... I feel very ripped off!Pro: free small appetizer was given (tempura battered banana and a fish cake of some sort), friendly serviceCons: EXPENSIVE, food is borderline average to belowHidden gem:None",

I've frequently been to Sakanaya on Green Street for sushi though since Sakanaya has been consistently good. When we went in, the decor was nice and clean. Very modern and Asian styled. We were immediately greeted by the waitress. It was a Saturday afternoon and the place wasn't very busy, only 2 other tables were filled. After being seated, we looked over the menus. A lot of the items seemed fairly priced, comparable to Sakanaya's prices, probably cheaper. The service was good. She gave us free bites of appetizers even though we didn't order any and free dessert (watermelon slices). She was very attentive and refilled our water when it was low. She definitely earned a hefty tip.The food was okay, which is why I brought it to the 3 star level. I ordered a sushi entree along with the New York roll and my friend got the bulgogi. The bulgogi was as good as any. The sushi had too much wasabi. The roll was slightly messy too, not neat and tight. If you're looking for a quick bite and for okay Asian food, I would go here. So long as you're not looking to wait at the long lines at Sakanaya, this would be my second choice.",

Ever. \u00a0Between the three of us we found 4+ bones in our sushi. \u00a0 The sushi was painfully average and the ratio of wasabi to rice in the nigiri was either too weak or too strong. \u00a0Speaking of wasabi, theirs had this weird gritty consistency to it - kind of like when you make a paste with flour. \u00a0And it was really, really weak. \u00a0Ick. I'm not even sure the agedashi tofu we ordered contained tofu - it was this weird mess of over fried... something? \u00a0batter? panko? And resembled little crumpled piece of paper. \u00a0Yeah no. \u00a0Not good.We were seated at the bar which also doubled as the area where food was served from. \u00a0It was interesting to see the number of orders that had to be brought back or changed because the chef had forgotten something. \u00a0It was extra interesting to watch the plates get passed over my friend's head while we are trying to have dinner. Our server ensured we had plenty of time to talk by being completely inattentive. \u00a0It took him easily 15-20 minutes just to take our order and then we waited... and waited... and waited for the food to come out. \u00a0Thankfully my friends are good company or the wait would have been excruciatingly painful. \u00a0The one time he did check up on us we mentioned all the bones we had found and his response was to nod, do a little laugh, shrug and walk off. \u00a0Right. \u00a0I must have missed that becoming an appropriate reaction. \u00a0My bad.All in all a bad experience. \u00a0Never again.",

That or somehow they figured out that it was my girlfriend's birthday dinner and delivered her rolls on a bamboo stand with candles stuck in wasabi balls hahaCONS:- Entrees such as the teppanyaki all fail miserably short in flavor, quality, and consistency- If there are more than 3 tables filled, the restaurant gets overwhelmed and you can expect a dramatic fall off in service and increase in wait times for your food- Miso soup is blandI agree with the other reviewer that lamented the fact that the rice was a little sloppy on the rolls and nigiri. I agree that sushi is an art, but when you're in southeastern Illinois in the middle of the cornfields with Korean sushi chefs, sometimes you just have to lower your expectations on good lookin' sushi. If fresh fish and rolls are what you're looking for, look no further than Yellowfin.The restaurant is run by Koreans, and they seem to be understaffed in the front as well as the back. However, service is attentive when it's not too busy, and the servers are college-age and friendly.There is a Korean market right next door and I would highly recommend stopping by to pick up some groceries or just great Asian junk food like Shin Ramen or those delectable Asian funyuns.Come here on a date or with a small group of friends for the good quality and selection of sashimi and rolls; the ambiance at night is intimate when it's not full. They have large bottles of all 3 major Japanese beers (Asahi, Sapporo, Kirin) for your enjoyment as well.",

I mean, how close is the closest ocean exactly?...But after reading good things about Yellowfin, I thought I'd give it a try and see for myself. The restaurant is a little out of the way, but apparently it doesn't keep the \"crowds\" from coming: I went on a Monday night with terrible weather, and the restaurant was still relatively busy. Not too much to say about the place itself: the deco could definitely use more work, and it kind of looks like a cheap Chinese restaurant (with the exception of the sushi bar). But who really cares... The menu is pretty extensive, with mostly Japanese food (and a lot of sushi) but also some Korean items. I ordered the salmon teriyaki combo ($15), which turned out to be a lot more food than I expected: salmon filet and sauteed vegetable in teriyaki sauce, white rice, three pieces of sushi (tuna, salmon, shrimp), salad, a California roll, miso soup, and a scoop of ice-cream!! Needless to say I was full after finishing all that food. And while it wasn't necessarily exceptional, it was pretty good overall and I left satisfied. Not bad for the price.",

I love how the place isn't really located in a very commercial area.. which makes the place a true hidden gem and you gotta look for it. The place is small, gives you that at home feel for some reason. The waitress is extremely sweet and nice, so does the other staff. Rice quality is OK, they really hold the fish/shrimp and veggies together better than other japanese joints where their rice don't hold the content that very well. Sushi may take awhile if there are a lot of people since there's only 1 sushi chef, but very worth the wait. (Last time me and my sister went there, there were actually 2 of them. So maybe that will help the wait lol)Another favorite thing about this restaurant is how they give you free stuff on certain days. We got free seaweed salad, miso soup, tempura banana, and even a 6 pc sushi roll from the chef on different days! They got the best mochi ice cream ever, extremely cold but very good. Their fried rice is addicting for some reason, very different from all the stuff I've tasted.Teppan grill is good, although it seems like they kept changing the portion everytime we go there. Now when they serve the rice, they put it on the plate upside down when I really prefer it on the small bowl so I can \"cup\" it with my chopstick easily. I haven't tried their Korean items but will someday!I will always come back to this place and I can't wait to take my BF from Frisco here! :)",

They're also one of the few sushi or Asian restaurants open on Monday, which is nice to know when your week is off to a bad start and you really want a sushi fix.",

I understand the results of rice in the refrigerator, but \u00a0give a shorter pick-up time so that it is not prepared after 10 minutes and then sitting out for 15.Many of the reviews for these places rave about the rolls, and for good reason. A sushi roll does some really great things for masking the quality of the fish you are using. Toss in some mayo, masago, and cucumber and it all tastes the same. My nigiri left sooo sooo much to be desired. The tuna was dark and stringy, the salmon almost flavorless, and the rest of the assortment was dry and average. Secondly, too...much...wasabi. Each piece had a huge amount underneath the fish...my sinuses may never be the same. After a few pieces I began disassembling everything to wipe off some of it in order to actually taste the fish.The one roll that really made me smile was the spicy tuna. Rarely do sushi joints use the right amount of mayonnaise, and this one surprisingly does. It was creamy, but not overly so. I cannot speak for any of the cooked food but I am sure they are fine.

Entering, though, you find that this is a good and popular spot for sushi, etc.Visiting a couple weeks ago, my wife and I had a couple of fairly unusual and quite tasty maki: Amigo (redolent of cilantro) and Illini (with Italian herbed oil). We really enjoyed the spicy tuna dish appetizer, and tempura appetizer.On the other hand, the green tea was not hot, barely warm. And, the combination of popularity, close tables, and hard surfaces made the place extremely noisy. Once the crowd died down and the restaurant was 1/3 full, conversation could again be carried on without shouting.This was probably our third time, and won't be the last. But, we'll try to go during off-peak hours to avoid the noise.",

Initially, I was just happy to have an option that wasn't incredibly overpriced and over-focused on fancy tempura-laden rolls. Simple sushi is where its at, and its what they do well.Unfortunately, the quality of their food has only gone down, and after tonight I'm not going to be taking my business there anymore. We got into the restaurant around 6:50pm. Not peak dinner-time, but still kind of crowded in the small space. There was ONE waiter working the 6-7 tables there, and he was clearly being run ragged. He provided decent customer service given his situation, and was definitely handling it as well as he could.No amount of customer service can make up for crappy food and unsatisfying portions, though. The \"combo\" platters are little more than some type of protein (shrimp, scallops, chicken, beef, or tofu), and some vegetables thrown into a wok that might have had soy sauce in it at some point during the day. No kidding, I don't think there was even teriyaki sauce on there...just soy sauce. I can, and do, make better stir fry at home. Their sushi is small, but they serve it nice and cold, which is a step up from other restaurants in the area. The fish is of decent quality (re: it won't kill you), but today I noticed that the portions of fish had gotten even tinier over the last few months. I think the chef was slicing the fish in half lengthwise, it was so thin!They do not include soup and salad with your meal, unless it is one of the above-mentioned combo platters. This is garbage. Soup/salad is par for the course for most places now, and no amount of icky tempura-fried banana and slim pieces of fruit served as \"dessert\" can account for that. The salad dressing for the house salad tastes like water, and they use it like soup; my lettuce was SWIMMING. Pros: cold sushi, well-flavored rolls and nigiri, and a lot of optionsCons: # of waiters available, soup/salad for extra charge, super tiny portions, and very overpriced. I won't be back. There isn't much in the way of sushi in Chambana, but there is better than this.",

We came for a birthday party (we had a reservation for 6.. but it wound up being 8 and they accommodated us with no questions asked.. +1!) at around 6 on a Saturday, and there were only 2 other tables seated in the restaurant. Service started out a little shaky (our waiter was quite young), but nothing to complain about, really. Once we were all seated and had our orders placed, the evening just went really smoothly (which is really how parties at restaurants should be, I think). Though the rolls took a while to come out (we all ordered sushi in one form or another), we were sent out first a round of complimentary miso soup, and then trays of beautifully presented banchan (or Japanese food presented in banchan style). Our sushi came out pretty much all at the same time (though the waiter forgot one of my friend's second roll order until the end). I've only had the sushi here, so I can't speak for the hot food, but it is very fresh tasting and has clean flavor profiles. It seems to be that the majority of the rolls are dominated by fish and veggies rather than cream cheese/tempura style rolls, which is a nice break from some of the other restaurants in town. In my opinion, the rolls are on the pricey side ($6 for a simple maki to avg $13 for a 'special'), but I come from the land of cheap fish, so Yellowfin is competitive for the market in town. Finally, the chef sent out some tempura bananas topped with mango sauce and caramel. If you've not had a tempura banana, you're really missing out! I guess what impressed me the most was 1) how seamless the service integrated with the table's needs and 2) the effort put into the presentation and quality of the food. We were able to enjoy our night out without having to worry too much about really anything.. everything just flowed. The sushi was beautifully presented, with beautiful pieces of fish as well as intricately carved garnishes.Bottom line: When a sushi craving hits any day other than a Sunday or Monday, I'll be headed to Yellowfin",

The waiters were knowledgeable and friendly, but not overbearing. The vibe is, as people say, dark but cool, and it is very difficult to spot if you don't already know where it is.One weird moment -- the first time we ever went to Farren's, my gf asked the waiter for a beer recommendation and received a \"Wheach\" -- a Peach Wheat. This was a very good selection, as it combines two of her favorite things: fruit-flavored beer and puns. The next time we went back, she asked for the Wheach -- and the waiter had no idea what we were talking about. Not \"we're out\" or \"it's no longer in season\" or \"we no longer carry that\" -- he had never heard of it. All of the beer we've gotten there since has been solid, but we never saw the Wheach again....",

I ordered the grilled scallop salad (because when the guy next to me ordered it and I decided immediately that is what I wanted as well). I am so glad I copied him. This salad was sooo good. Mixed greens. Sweet fruity dressing, Tasty scallops. Walnuts. Strawberries. Grapes. I also think that most salads like this use either feta or goat cheese, but this salad had Parmesan cheese which I think was perfect because the other cheeses I find to be too overwhelming sometimes. Also make sure you get the crackers that come with the salad! Apparently, their burgers are good too.... Maybe next time!",

I think it is probably an attempt to keep the campus kids out and create an environment that is more for the locals, which can be nice.The place is small but our group of five was easily able to get a table on a Thursday night. The service was pretty decent, and it didn't take long to get our food. In my opinion, the tricolor chips were better than the house fries but I am probably in the minority on that one.

Am I in the right place?Poor beer, wine and food selection (as in no selection). We tried the fried ravioli which were served on a bed of wilting lettuce. The mediocrity pushed us to ask if they were made in house-- our server told us no with an apologetic smile. Then why exactly am I paying upwards of $9 for this frozen bullshit? We had a real good laugh about all the upcharges for our choice of side. Tortilla chips come standard and it's extra for fries?! Cmon. I really should have known something was amiss when our server neglected to ask how we would like our burgers cooked. The bacon on my burger was undercooked and chewy, while the patty was wayyy overcooked. No pink in sight.

The fresh house made potato chips are like crack with the black truffle sea salt they use. My heart was almost broken when they were sold out of chips, but the server (also the owner) said they could add the crack...erm... salt.. to the house cut fries. Wasn't quite the same, but it was still very tasty. Service isn't always super friendly, but I don't care when I get the best burger and chips in town. The burgers aren't the only good part. They have daily specials that have always been satisfying and unique. They also have some stellar dark beers. Wait time can be a little long depending on when you come, but it's worth the wait.",

Waiters and waitresses were welcoming and accommodating, but the service, after we ordered, was slow as molasses. Granted, it's a busy weekend night, but how long does it take to get an order of burger and fries cooked? It was probably an hour between us entering the door and getting our food. However, after my green chile cheeseburger came, the wait didn't seem so bad after all. It's hands-down the best burger place in town, and I'm surprised it took me this long to find it. The meat had plenty of juiciness and flavor, and the thick, but not overpowering bun soaked up a lot of the sauce. The secret to an enjoyable burger-eating experience? A good meat-to-bun-ratio and a manageable stack. If the stack keeps falling apart, you're not going to have a good time. Farren's makes a remarkably well-balanced burger, and that in itself gets this restaurant 4 stars. But tortilla chips come standard with the burger, instead of fries? What were they thinking?Have a burger here with a smaller group of people on a less-crowded night (or for lunch). It's slightly on the pricey side but you won't be disappointed.",

They're always cooked to perfection, with an appropriately proportionate bun and delicious, thick, crunchy pickles. And, if you're pretty starved, I suggest getting fries on the side. They're toasty brown and delicious, especially when doused with malt vinegar.They also have a full bar and great apps, specials, and desserts. I sometimes just get the hummus plate app for dinner. And the fish n chips special is pretty darn good for being land locked. As for desserts, if they happen to have the chocolate chile cheesecake, DO IT.The environment is very laid back and the restaurant is fairly dim. There are a couple of TVs, but if you don't like to be distracted, you can sit away from them.Beware days of Illini games; they are packed to the gills at dinner time.",

I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner, but don't expect a table at peak hours right away ...it's quite popular! The service was excellent, no fuss or finesse, and fast.

I'm giving the place 2 stars for a few reasons: the \"Fire\" burger was probably around a 2 or 3 out of 10 on (my) spicy scale. \u00a0 The burger, although properly cooked and juicy (a nice medium-well), lacked seasoning and resultingly flavor. Between a lack of spiciness and lack of spices, the burger was pretty bland. \u00a0Add to that some undercooked and unseasoned fries to have a whole plate of bland. For burgers that cost around $9, I would expect a lot more. \u00a0I can't say its worth the wait and I definitely have no desire to go back.",

I got a bacon burger with bleu cheese crumbles. The meat was cooked almost perfectly and I got a generous heap of cheese on top. I almost couldn't taste the bacon though...I would suggest they kick it up a notch.I found it odd that the default side is tortilla chips. They are pretty average, but do have a nice seasoning and taste good with their in-house made salsa (had to ask for it, though). It was fresh-tasting and not too spicy.Beer selection is good. They had about 5 beers on tap and a healthy list of bottles. The bottle selection was not what you typically see at a burger place, which I liked. Prices weren't too bad either.I'd come here again, for sure. If anything, I want to try that bison burger that people have been talking about. I LOVE bison burgers, but wanted to try their more traditional burger to see what all the fuss was about. It's a nice atmosphere. Everything is right there. There's no \"back\"; you can see the kitchen and where all of your food is coming from.

And the pink dressing on top of it didn't help.I strongly considered eating around the chicken, but brought myself to taste it and it was actually really good. \u00a0I just don't know how they cooked it to make it look so horrible. \u00a0So my suggestions for this restaurant when serving a salad that includes chicken: Throw it on the grill for a few seconds to give it some grill marks or do SOMETHING to give it some color. \u00a0And then toss the salad to mix in that pink dressing.So good food, good service, but presentation of my dish kept this place from getting 4*",

Way too much. \u00a0Burgers, fries, salmon burgers, steaks, chicken sandwiches, salad, etc. \u00a0it's all pouring oil out the wazoo. \u00a0I got to say the service is exceptional though. \u00a0Every time I've went the service was very friendly, quick, and our food always came out fast. \u00a0Prices are reasonable too. \u00a0As for the atmosphere, I can see some people digging it but it's quite \"unique\" to say the least. \u00a0You really would never even be able to guess this was a restaurant looking at it from the outside. \u00a0There's a sign on the main road for it, but then you got to walk into the block a little bit and its in a plain colored building, hid away in a little nook. \u00a0It only gets more \"interesting\" as you go in and descend into the restaurant. \u00a0Yes, it's in a sort of a basement almost. \u00a0I'm not against the place by any means, and the food is OK and the service is great. \u00a0It's just far too greasy for me. \u00a0It's just a place for those that don't mind really really greasy food.",

Oooh, beer list. Oooh, beer I've never had! Order beer.\"*beer consumed*\"Ooh, menu! WHAT? HOUSEMADE CHIPS? WITH TRUFFLE SALT? Hey! Fried portabello - Battered, deep-fried and served with ranch??! YAY APPETIZERS! I should have another beer...\"*beer consumed*\"BURGERS! With BACON! And BLEU CHEESE! And MUSHROOMS! YAAAY!\"Basically, I'm internally like a candy-fueled ten-year old on Christmas morning, only instead of toys I'm really 25, slightly drunk, and ordering menu items with no abandon. Farren's is awesome. The prices are high-ish, and for a reason - the food is damn good. It's a burger place, but they make an effort to dress the food up a bit. The service has always been friendly and prompt. The problem I have with Farren's is not with their establishment, but for the shame and self-loathing I encounter after ordering two appetizers, a huge burger, and two or three beers, and consuming all of it, like a black hole for food and drinks. And the immense discomfort of feeling like I could possibly literally explode. And then the resonant shame I feel when I get my Discover bill and I think, \"Hey, did I take a whole group of people to dinner? How did I spend $40 at Farren's? I thought we split checks that night... oh... we did.\"tl;dr version: Farren's is amazing, there are wonderful things with truffle salt, also maybe fried, but it is a little pricey and not diet food.

Farrens, to say the least, has become a home-away-from-home. Oh, and their beer options!-so good :) Anytime someone is looking for a great burger, I direct them here. Anytime someone is looking for a good beer, I direct them here. Anytime someone is looking for good food in general, you guessed right....I direct them here. This is the perfect place if you're with a group that have an eclectic taste. HOWEVER, expect to wait if you come with a big group on a friday or saturday night but you shouldn't wait too long.

It has a nice selection of beer, but not the best in town. \u00a0What draws me back are the sliders, the 7 Saints Salad and the waffle fries. My first time here I had the 7 Sinners Crowd Pleaser and it was just as sinfully good as described. Especially the beer battered cheese curds that you've read many reviews praising. However, I cannot incorporate it in every meal as it is rather lot of food.So my usual go to is the 7 saints salad which has a lemony-peanut dressing that I just cannot forget. It is especially good during lunch when they serve it half size. \u00a0I feel really good about myself after eating it, because I get my veggies and protein (yummy sirloin). \u00a0I would generally split this with someone and add a few sliders. You can always substitute the beef patty with chicken or turkey (or boca). The California is one that I enjoy. Personally don't like the Chicago Dog, which should remain a dog. Lastly I finish with the waffle fries! Oh just delicious. Well seasoned!",

        "review": "Cheese Curd Heaven at \"Gourmet White Castle!\"Slide on over to Seven Saints, a trendy, burger bar specializing in sliders in Champaign, IL. It offers house-made, hand-pattied beef sliders with a variety of gemlicious topping combos and complimentary lettuce, tomatoes, pickles & onions upon request. If beef isn't your baby, don't fret, there are plenty of other protein options or try em all: hand-made, seasoned turkey patty, salmon, bratwurst, hotdog, blt, grilled chicken, fried chicken patty, and boca burgers are also available as slider options.\u00a0Also, Seven Saints has a gemload of yummy salads, sides and apps. You can order things a la carte, or they offer mix & match combo platters (e.g.\u00a0choose a slider, 1/2 salad & a side, the \"Triple S Combo\" for $9.79 or choose a slider & a 1/2 salad for $7.99, etc.). I got the original turkey slider with lettuce, tomato & pickle & a 1/2 order of the Greek salad. As an app, I ordered the cheese curds, and on a subsequent visit I got a side order of sweet potato fries.\u00a0For starters, the cheese curds here are the best ones I've ever had! They are made in-house, lightly beer-battered & are like giant marshmallows stuffed with gooey, white cheddar cheese. They will cost you $8.49 out of pocket & set you back about 2 weeks worth of calories & cholesterol, but they alone are worth the road trip to Champaign!My turkey burger slider was a little larger than a silver dollar. It was nothing extraordinary but was fresh, not greasy & pretty tasty, a solid 4 stars. The mini bun was nice & soft too.\u00a0I also got the half order of the Greek salad which is field greens tossed in a traditional Greek vinaigrette with cucumbers, kalmata olives, red onions, pepperoncinis, fire-roasted artichokes & is topped with feta cheese. It was really flavorful, fresh & tasty, and I would re-order it!\u00a0I don't order sweet potato fries that often but ordered them here because they were crinkle-cut which I rarely see. I'm glad I did because they were some of the best SPF I've ever had. At some places, the customary straight ones are either limp/soggy with no crispiness or overly sweet with some unwelcome/unwanted surprise, sugary-coating basted all over them. These guys were soft on the inside with a perfect, crispiness on the outside (kind of like White Castle's regular fries), and they weren't doused in any surprise, sugary-coating. They had a nice, natural sweet potato taste, 5 gems for taste & texture!\u00a0Last thing, this bar is well-stocked for the most part. It has a gemload of liquor & craft beers. I tried Rain Organic Vodka on the rocks with regular olives for the first time. I didn't really care for it because it's a lil harsh with a sweet after taste. If I ever come back, I will just stick to Chopin Vodka, since they didn't\u00a0have Ciroc Vodka, my fave (boo).\u00a0All in all, my experience at Seven Saints was pretty heavenly. The service here is decent but needs a slight tune up. The bartenders were friendly but service was a lil slow & scattered for my taste (however not Denny's-Champaign, IL slow, thank heavens!), almost a 4 though. The cheese curds & sweet potato fries were the saints of the show, and I do like all of the various slider & salad options on the menu. (Think gourmet White Castle with salads & booze too!)It's dark & nice inside, and they are striving for a Wicker Park-like, Chicago bar feel. So if you ever find yourself in Champaign, IL, I recommend dining & drinking at this gemlicious, slider-burger bar as it was one of my fave places I visited in Champaign, a solid, high 4 gems!",

In my opinion, the portions were definitely very reasonable. \u00a0The sliders were about the size of the diameter of a standard water or beer glass or at least that is what our waiter told us! Seven Saints ended up being the perfect spot to catch up with old friends over some delicious food; I'd definitely recommend this joint to anyone with a rumbling tummy in downtown Chambana!",

I believe this is a new menu item which comes with 2 giant soft pretzels, mustard for dipping, and an amazing jalepeno cheese sauce. The pretzel was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt. I could have eaten a bowl of that jalepeno cheese sauce.Main course: I love it when restaurants allow you to combine menu items, like any variety of a soup/ salad/ sandwich combo. At SS, you can definitely create a combo to your liking. I ordered the soup with half sandwich. The price and quality just blew my mind. You think a tomato bisque soup is boring? Seven Saints will change that opinion of yours! I got that tomato bisque soup with half a tuna melt sandwich and i was in food heaven.Dessert: It's very rare that I have room in my stomach for an appetizer, main course, and dessert. Well, I didn't have room, but that didn't stop me from ordering a sweet sensation. The blueberry cheesecake with ginger crust was absolutely incredible, and I don't regret that decision one bit.Service: Impeccable. I ordered an arnold palmer to drink, and I never saw the bottom of my glass. The food was prompt and our server was helpful. Even with the packers vikings game on TV, we had an extremely pleasant time.I know Illinois is known for good food, but man, I was not expecting this amazingness :) A++++++",

If you don't know what that is, then you have to make sure you check out ALL of the discount alcohol nights at Seven Saints because they are all deals you should take advantage of!The whiskey I got was Snake River Stampede. Mainly because I thought it was funny that it was considered a \"rodeo whiskey\" and also that the description for it said \"this whisky can still kick like a bucking bronco when served neat.\" haha.Another nice thing is that they alcohol menu has two featured House drinks and a description for both. This makes it a bit easier while choosing a drink and you don't have to ask the waitress/waiter about every single drink. Even though my server was nice enough to do it if asked.I got the Triple \"S\" Platter (Slider, 1/2 Salad, and a Side). I got the cheese slider, 1/2 Caesar salad and waffle fries. I liked all the food. Their waffle fries were really good.Up until I tried Seven Saints, I only thought of sliders as the little burgers you get from White Castle, but Seven Saints is now my favorite place to get them. I'll definitely be back soon.",

I still go back every year for Christmas to visit family and friends, and when I do, Seven Saints is a must-hit place for food. And I get the same thing every single time.The Triple S Combo Platter. One salmon slider. BLT salad (although I have also tried the Country Fried Chicken Salad... sounds weird but was really tasty). And the tomato basil soup. This is a trifecta of yumminess in my tumminess. There has only been once when the food all tasted kind of off, possibly a bad day. But every year, it always pleases me. And the bill isn't so bad. I don't really drink here, but have had a mojito that was alright, nothing special. I will continue frequenting this establishment for my yearly Christmas visiting. Please stay in business Seven Saints, otherwise I will be forced to make this food on my own and it won't be pretty.",

I'd say it's more for an older crowd or at least a more relaxed one. The variety of beer and wine is awesome. I thought the sliders there were delicious, same with the soups and salads. Of all of the bars downtown, this one definitely has the best food.The actual atmosphere on the other hand is really nice. There are old pews, vintage chandeliers, and a beautiful wooden piece in the back of the main room all from old Churches, and it was the 7th bar opened by the owner, hence the name Seven Saints. It's all pretty cute and makes a nice place to have an outside dinner. I'd recommend it for sure!",

I've never heard any complaints or noticed any discrimination or racism. People are overwhelmingly happy with their experiences here, as evidenced by how busy it is. Wednesdays do tend to get hectic, so if you are high-maintenance / demanding / have a chip on your shoulder, you may want to pick a different night to go. If you're a normal person like 99% of the other people around, you'll have a good time.With that out of the way, Seven Saints is THE PLACE to drink whiskey, especially on Wednesday, with a 1/2-price special on one of four rotating themes. Every whiskey they have is in one of the themes and will be 1/2-price on its respective day. They have an incredible selection with a whole menu page or two for each theme. The bartenders that work that night are passionate about whiskey and it shows. They know their stuff and can always make a good recommendation based on what you like, tell you why they recommend it for you, tell you what to look for, and answer any questions.",

I particularly recommend the buffalo chicken slider- easily my favorite. Do yourself a favor and ask the waiter/waitress his/her opinion on the amount of food you order- it's very easy to order too much for your party to handle.Beer: Some great seasonal beers on tap for not too much $. You can expect to see draft, seasonal beers for $4, and other beers for cheaper. There are tons of draft and bottled choices. This place has a great bar to sit, watch games, and enjoy an ice cold brew.Service: I was only with one other person so we asked to sit (and eat) at the bar. We had 2,3 staff members (bar tenders) help each other out when it came to waiting on us. They have a team approach- which leads to faster service. The bartenders knew their Illini sports, cared about the downtown Champaign environment by knowing about that weekend's events, and were very down to earth.Overall: I had a fantastic meal, including appetizers, and a beer for $21. A similar place in Chicago would be double that- and the food wouldn't be better either. Downtown Champaign has fantastic bars and eats, and this place is one of them. Seven Saints covers all of the bases- i've eaten here with my family for special occasions, and i've come here in the wee hours of the morning to get my drink on.",

Also, I really love the rib eye steak sandwich, its pricey ($10), but its amazing and it comes with a side (onion rings are killers in here).There is also the possibility of ordering combos with salad, soup, etc... I never had that, but I heard its pretty good.Bottom line: this place is a MUST in Champaign. During weekend it might get crowded and with a waiting line, usually I go by myself, so I never had that problem.",

There is a wood bar and lots of tables and booths abound. Again, very nice and clean. Not a lot of character, but enjoyable.The quality is fine. Nothing wrong with the taps or bottles. The service is decent as far as taking orders and knowing what they have. Though I had to argue with several bartenders to get a half pint of a Barleywine. I don't know why that should be an argument?The food is decent. Though I am not really a fan of everything being a \"slider.\" That makes a lot of the menu a la cart. My first visit, I ended up with a steak salad, but there was not much steak to be seen. What was there was tough and chewy. \u00a0The salad was a bit slimy as well. \u00a0The sliders are nothing bad, they just never seem to live up to what I would expect from the description.Besides a few decent offerings, the tap list is pretty generic. Eight taps that consist of Blue Moon, Fat Tire Guinness, Magic Hat, some BMC, Southern Tier Seasonal, and a managers choice (Arcadia Barleywine when I first visited). \u00a0That rotates a bit, so the selection does change. \u00a0The bottle list somewhat makes up for the sub par tap list. Mostly the usual suspects like Rogue, Bells, Goose Island, Founders, etc. Overall decent, but not ground breaking (considering the handful of really good beer bars in walking distance).Overall, just an average place to grab a beer and a meal. A slightly above average beer selection, and slightly above average food. There is really nothing that distinguishes this place above the many other restaurant in the area, and there are much better beer bars in the area without a doubt.",

I knew this place was usually busy but when we put our name in, they said it would take 30 minutes. So we figured we would wait since we had not been there in a long time. After an hour of waiting, they were able to seat 6 people. The other 6 had to wait for an adjacent table to open up. It did not open up for another 30 minutes. So I was just really confused on how they would tell us it would take 30 minutes when really it took 1 hour and 30 minutes. The first half of our group had already ordered for us in an attempt to save some time since everyone was starving. After we were seated, it took about 10 minutes for our server to come ask us what we wanted to drink, and then another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks. The food was alright. I usually get different sliders, but decided to try the steak sandwich. It was pretty good, a little messy though since there was a ton of oil that came with it. After we finished, the guy took all of our plates, and then it took 10 minutes for him to ask us if we were ready for the check. then it took him another 10 minutes to get us the check. And then another 10 minutes to charge all the cards. That was one of the worst dining experiences I've had. Over 2 hours of just waiting for things. You would think that with a larger group, he would have paid more attention to us but guess it doesn't work that way.Like I said earlier, I've been here before and they were ok experiences, which accounts for the 2nd star. But we'll see if I ever go back in the near future. Just pissed that we waited so long when the server kept saying it would be 5-10 more minutes every time we asked.",

This is possibly my favorite feature of any bar in the area.They always have a nice selection of beer on tap too (at a nice range of prices) and have recently started \"Brewsdays\" with some nice beer specials.Seven Saints has some quality food too. Sliders, salads, sides, desserts... It's all delicious. Definitely try the sweet potato fries or beet chips. My only complaint about the menu is that, since I tend to order vegetarian, the options can get a little stale (though you can sub in a veggie burger on any of their sliders).My favorite meal? California Turkey Slider (sub a veggie burger, hold the bacon), waffle fries, and the Southwest Chipotle Salad.And last, but not least, the atmosphere: Seven Saints feels classy, but not so classy that you'll feel underdressed if you show up in a t0shirt and jeans. It's a darker feel and the furniture and decorations are detailed and thought-out. Even when it's busy, they bar doesn't get too terribly loud so it's great for a date or a night out with friends if you'd like to be able to have a conversation at the table.",

I'm also spoiled. I'm from California where there are actually more than six places to choose from for cocktails and late-night dining. It's not that I don't love quaint little Champaign-Urbana, but if a place doesn't \u00a0live up to your expectations, there are not many other options to choose from. \u00a0Ask any of my friends: they heard me complain about this for months when I first moved here over three years ago.... Then I found Seven Saints. This place excels in everything I look for: customer service, quality product, and environment. As you can see from the pictures, the ambiance is warm, intimate and inviting. The seating and decor create an environment that is perfect for enjoying time with a date, group of friends, coworkers, and even people you don't really like but are forced to hang out with once in a while. Their menu has what I like to think of as fancy versions of classic Midwestern treats. They are famous for their sliders--try the Black Jack Slider, come back here, and thank me. Or go for the hat trick and add on the Salmon Slider and California Turkey Slider and thank me three times. The lovely waitresses & waiters are always friendly and attentive. It's amazing how they stay on top of tables & orders when it gets busy. As for drinks, I'm just starting to learn about beer and they have a wide selection to choose from. Tuesdays they have beer specials, which is a great time to sample things I wouldn't normally order. And now for my favorite part: Whiskey Wednesday. I've waited over two years to write this review because I treated Whiskey Wednesday like Fight Club... it's so awesome, you aren't supposed to talk about it. The guilt has pushed me and I feel it is now time to let those of you who don't know in on this marvelous secret: every Wednesday they feature 50% off their whiskey menu. That's right. This isn't a fake-out Miko's 50% off either. This is an unbelievable selection of quality whiskeys from around the world... for half the price. They rotate weeks from North American, Irish, Bourbon and Scotch in addition to weekly featured bottles. I'm not cool enough to call myself a whiskey connoisseur, but I am very stuck up about my whiskey. The two Whiskey Wednesday bartenders are amazing and are always able to find new and exciting things for me behind the bar. They REALLY know their stuff. Try it. Go in and pick any whiskey off the menu. They can tell you about the grain, barrels, aging process, blend--everything. I can't even remember what I had for lunch yesterday. They are extremely helpful and know the full range of whiskey flavors. I've been in many times with friends who don't drink whiskey often, or are just starting out and want to go easy. It doesn't matter how experienced you are, the Whiskey Wednesday boys will take care of you. Andy is the general manager and I can never say too many good things about him. At most other restaurants, you'll see the manager walking around to check things out, but that's about it. Andy introduces himself and actually talks to the customers. He is always around to make sure people have a good experience. It's a pleasure to listen to him tell you about the history behind a specific bottle or cocktail. If you've seen him on the CBS morning show, you can tell how passionate he is about what he does. So yes, I just gushed about Seven Saints--but I mean every word of it. The quality products & excellent customer service are enough to satisfy this high-maintenance Californian. I'm also narcissistic enough to believe you'll actually come back on here to thank me. Seriously. Go check them out. I'll see you again soon.",

        "review": "I am torn over what to do with Seven Saints. \u00a0When I first went there I thought the food was great and the drinks were wonderful. \u00a0Over time, it has lost its luster. \u00a0What follows is my progression.My first visit was mostly about the drinks. \u00a0I found the beer menu to be decent (which is what I felt like drinking that night). \u00a0I know I ordered food and I was not displeased with it. \u00a0Overall, my first experience was good and I came back for more. \u00a0My next visit included food and drinks. \u00a0I went with some sort of mixed drink that tasted fine but was not memorable. \u00a0I had the salmon slider to eat. \u00a0I did not notice if the menu listed what came with the slider or not, and the waitress did not bother to mention that the slider come with just the sandwich. \u00a0When I got my slider I realized that one mini sized salmon sandwich was not going to be enough for dinner. \u00a0Sadly, I started eating the slider before I ordered more food. \u00a0I can only describe it as a salty salmon puck. \u00a0After that, I was no longer hungry, and we went elsewhere.I returned for lunch, and had the BLT salad with the tomato soup. \u00a0I recommend both options. \u00a0The soup was so good that I came back for lunch again and paired it with the tomato pesto grilled cheese. \u00a0This was also wonderful. \u00a0In fact it was so good that I found myself craving the soup and grilled cheese one day so I went for lunch. \u00a0Now, I am not a fan of swiss cheese which is one of the cheeses in the sandwich. \u00a0I requested that the swiss cheese be replaced with provolone instead. \u00a0When I got my sandwich there was no swiss cheese, but there was no other cheese on the sandwich. \u00a0There should have been American cheese as well. \u00a0I guess the server misunderstood my request, and I figured it was an honest mistake so I didn't think it was a big deal.The last straw was yesterday. \u00a0I went for lunch again and ordered the tomato pesto grilled cheese with the tomato soup. \u00a0Again I requested that the swiss be replaced with provolone. \u00a0When I got my sandwich it was more like toast than a grilled cheese. \u00a0There was one slice of American cheese and one slice of provolone cheese on each piece of bread, but the cheese was not melty and gooey. \u00a0It was toasted and crispy. \u00a0Then the pesto was glopped on in one cold dollop. \u00a0I found the sandwich to be dry. From now on I will probably only go to this place for the drinks. \u00a0Too bad I can find drinks at just about any bar in town. \u00a0I feel let down because I really wanted to like this place. \u00a0I love the look and feel of the bar, and it has all the potential to be great. \u00a0However, if they can't even accomplish a grilled cheese sandwich why would you want to eat their food?",

So, we ordered the cheese curds, a Rogue Dead Guy Ale and an Anchor Steam (solid beer choices, if you're in the market). The cheese curds were not cheese curds.....they were palm-sized balls of mozzarella with a light, gooey breading on them. \u00a0And they came with a delicious marinara sauce. \u00a0Let me tell you something: These 'curds' are not f'n around. \u00a0They are formidable. \u00a0We couldn't finish them, they were so heavy. \u00a0How is it that Illinois managed to out-fat bastard Wisconsin? \u00a0Go figure. \u00a0Seven Saints is a very pretty bar, at least at night. \u00a0All espresso-dark wood and nice lighting. \u00a0And the jukebox was interesting. \u00a0When we first got in there, the crowd all seemed slightly older....so it was very odd that some new hip hop/hump dancey song was bumping over the stereo. \u00a0Swiftly and even more randomly, the jukebox changed over to super hits of my early adolescence: Blind Melon, Spin Doctors, and even some Van Halen. \u00a0I was okay with this, if not a little more than amused.When it comes right down to it, we all know I'm coming back.",

        "review": "Summer in Champaign is ALL about outdoor seating. This great new restaurant has got it right. With plenty of space out and inside, and self-seating, the atmosphere is always semi-casual and always welcoming. After looking at the menu, we expected an average dining experience, based on the fact that the menu accentuates burgers (they call their mini-burgers SLIDERS) and salads...not our usual dining-out fare.However...the wings are the BEST WINGS we have ever had in our lives. They are not your usual buffalo-drowned bits of suspiciously massive chook, these are fine specimens of realistically-sized, expertly-cooked bird, served crispy with your choice of two sauces, (there are lots to choose...from BBQ to Thai Peanut and beyond).In ordering, we found that each ordering the Slider/Salad combo worked really well, although sharing sliders and tasting different flavors also works well. There is an extensive beer/wine selection, including some fashionable Spanish options, however we seriously question a wine list without a single New Zealand option, especially in the Sauvignon Blanc section. Our favorite sliders so far have included the Buffalo Chicken, the BlackJack, the California Turkey and the Salmon, although we highly recommend asking for NO BUTTER on the buns if you are interested in 'eating lightly'. Our two salads (Goat Cheese and Spinach/Fried Chicken Salad) were both surprisingly delicious, after so many below-average iceberg salads in the mid-west.All in all, we think they have found a niche targeting people who appreciate casual dining prepared exceptionally well. This is the PERFECT OPTION for those diners who want a home-town up-scale alternative to Ruby Tuesday, Steak n Shake, Fridays, or perhaps even Guido's at the same price and not at the mall!Expect to spend $30 on food for 2 courses for 2 people.",

My fiance and I waited at the bar for a drink for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us what we wanted. That may not sound too long, but the place wasn't even busy. And what's funny is the bartender was like purposely ignoring us. There's no way she didn't see us politely flagging her down. She had a soft drink that she was drinking, and she stopped right in front of us, took a nice looooong drink... kind of relaxing, then she looked past us out the window, and proceeded to ignore us a bit longer. And its not like we were just standing there, you can try and flag them down, but they just ignore you like alien possessed humans staring into space or something. The bartender finally asked what we wanted, but by then we were being seated so we said nevermind. Then we proceeded to have terrible service at our table, to the point that it was just kind of amusing. Oh and my cobb salad had these huge mushroom tentacle things that made me gag and we just sorta wiggled them at our friends like \"look at this huge sick thing that's in my salad!\" And the sliders are way over priced. The cheese curds were good, but a little heavy. I say the place has potential because it's a really nice location and the inside has a nice ambiance.

The train got in over an hour late (which seems to be a common occurrence on this route), but I was still a few hours early for the game, so I grabbed some lunch at this place, which is right across the street from the Amtrak station. I was happy to see that it was not jam packed on game day morning. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was impressed with the large selection of beers available, both on tap and by the bottle. I'm used to Chicago prices, so being able to get a good draft beer for under 5 bucks was great. They also have Miller High Life on tap for $2 if you're looking to go \"cheap.\"Food wise, I went with a couple turkey sliders, since the menu claims that is what they are \"famous\" for. I also had some of the sweet potato fries. The sliders were just okay, I wasn't blown away by them or anything. Same thing with the fries. The portion was large, but I wasn't crazy about them (I went ahead and doused them in ketchup after I realized they weren't that good). It was a meal that was adequate, and not expensive (each slider was $2.50 and the fries were $1.99 if I am remembering correctly), so I'm not complaining. My total for 2 draft beers, the food, and tip was just over $20.The bartender introduced himself as \"Billy Mays\" and had on an Oxyclean shirt, which was his Halloween costume. He was nice enough and occasionally engaged in small talk, even as the place started to get more crowded. I didn't have any problems with him keeping my water and beer full, and my food was correct, so no issues there.When all is said and done, I can't give this place 5 stars simply because I wasn't blown away by anything.

Perhaps the owners need to start dropping back in or have people mystery shop the place.The menu - while not wildly innovative - was well thought out. The appetizers are well done and set up to share, though the fried portabella mushroom strips on the Seven Sinners plate had that 'I've sat in cold storage' flavor to them. That said, the cheese curds and also the beet chips were excellent. I liked the sliders - favoring the blackjack and the buffalo chicken slider. The triple-S plate used to be more of a deal when they would allow you to get two sliders and either a soup or salad. I was sorry to see that go. I've not tried the specials, and each time I've been everyone has done sliders, sandwiches, soup, or salads - so I cant speak to them. The desserts are nothing special, but were decently presented.Out first few trips, the staff was excellent. \u00a0We were seated relatively quickly despite being packed. Someone came to take our drink orders in the first few minutes. The waitress was willing to explain things to my party and make substitutions to satisfy vegetarian friends. The beer selection was decent and the mixed drinks were decently strong. While prices were a bit on the steep side, we were fairly happy. On a later trip, the service was slow, the raspberry iced tea was short on the raspberry syrup, and to be frank - I felt rushed out the door once we were done with our entree. That was too bad as the people I was with are the sort prone to ordering dessert and a couple rounds of drinks. If the place was crowded, I could have understood, but it seemed sort of empty.Other reviews have mentioned a chain-like feel. It's true the same group owns a few other local bars - so I'm assuming they use the same architects, designers, and back-office staff.

I've always been a ribeye steak fan, and in my teens when I first learned they make sandwiches out of them, I think I cried tears of joy. Ever since my first bite, I've been on the hunt for the next best ribeye sandwich.. and my friends, I search no more.I order mine blackened, medium-rare, with their delicious waffle fries. The first time I decided on this sandwich, I didn't have high expectations. I had ordered sliders here in the past and found them just okay. However, when they brought out my huge, melty, tender, delicious sandwich, I could hear the angels singing. It was GLORIOUS. I ate every single bite, and within 2 days I found myself back at Seven Saints, ordering another. This is my all time favorite steak sandwich, and I order it often.Aside from this amazing sandwich, the service is always good and the atmosphere is friendly and inviting.

Their food menu has a nice balance of innovation and old standards and was well-executed for everything our group of 6 ordered. Service is quick (turn and burn, baby!) even when they're full. If you are careful, the food and drink is actually quite reasonably priced: soup/sandwich combo, 2x beers, huge club with excellent sweet potato fries all for $30 (whiskey tab was a different story- but worth it). You certainly could spend more on you food here, but if you get the cheap stuff you will still be happy.

        "review": "This is one of my favorite local restaurants in CU. First of all, the atmosphere is really amazing. A lot of care was taken to make the inside of this place something special. It has a slightly dark, gothic feel yet it still feels very cozy and inviting. I do wish the space was a bit bigger, however, as it can get busy very quickly and you'll run out of places to sit.Service-wise I've almost always had great service. The wait-staff is friendly and the bartenders are fast and responsive. They have a nice selection of spirits. The best part has to be the food, though. They have a nice selection of salads. My absolute favorite is the Seven Saints Salad. I've never tasted anything quite like it. It has a crisp bed of greens topped with tiny hot green peppers and a VERY generous portion of pieces of steak. The steak is flavorful and moist and the whole salad has a clear dressing that compliments the other components perfectly. The best part is that you can have the salad as part of a special served with a couple of their sliders for around $8. It's a great deal.Speaking of their sliders, they have a really wonderful selection of mini-hamburgers. They aren't as heavily greasy as you might expect from a traditional slider. My favorites are probably the Asian slider with it's wasabi spread, the Buffalo Chicken slider (with an amazing sauce on a crispy piece of chicken and served with ranch dip) and the Blacjack burger. There are a ton more and pretty much anything to suit your taste.Another standout aspect of Seven Saints are their appetizers. If I have one complaint it's that they seem incapable of keeping their Beet Chips ready to order. Out of the five times I've tried to order them, I've only ever been able to get them twice. I don't know if I've just had bad timing or what but I do wish they were a bit more diligent with those. If you do manage to order them they are delicious and are served with a yummy goat cheese dip. If they are out of them, there are still a lot of great options. You can't go wrong with either of their mushroom appetizers.",

I really liked the atmosphere of the bar. It was a great place to watch the game I think next time but will just go for drinks since I didn't think the food was so great. I ordered the salmon slider and the salmon was so salty it was inedible. The other slider I ordered was okay nothing to rave about but the worst was the California turkey burger my friend ordered. The menu said it had avocado on it which it did but it was such a minuscule amount we literally cracked up about it.Its a clean bar and quiet enough to watch a game AND still hear the commentary but you might want to eat before you get there though.",

Loved the salad, but might not get the salmon again as the flavors just didn't work for me. However, they do substitute boca patties on any of the other sliders for $0.50 extra so I might try that next time.What I really like about this place is the strong drinks! Two drinks and I had a nice buzz, and I'm normally not a two-drink lady. The signature cocktails listed on their menu are pricey, but I ordered a Tom Collins (not on the menu) and it was $3.50, which is pretty good in my book.",

Fries oozing grease, bread and buns slathered with butter, etc. \u00a0I also tried some of the cheese curds (sounds disgusting, but quickly found out it's just like a round mozerella stick), waffle fries, sweet potato fries, and a classic slider (which apparently is what they are known for... sliders that is) \u00a0All of it was just very average, and even the acclaimed slider was nothing special. \u00a0I would probably not go here again if I had the choice, but other than I long wait to get waited on and an even longer one to get some drinks, there is really nothing too major I can dock the restaurant for other than it just did not appeal to me much personally. \u00a0I should note our server was very friendly, but I just can't really get into the food. \u00a0Just a very average joint.",

I'm boring and stick to the bacon ones, but on occasion I branch out; the tropical ones are also really good. What really sets this place apart are the chicken tenders, which are the best I've ever tried. They're reasonably priced and listed on the appetizer menu, but totally worth getting as a main course. The tomato bisque is apparently very good as well (but screw tomatoes, I'm sticking with the food).As good as the food is, the bar is even better. While the drinks are a bit expensive, if you come on Wednesday, various whiskeys are half off. They also have specials on Monday and Tuesday for wine and beer, respectively. I love the bar selection, though. Wednesdays are my favorite day, because I come to Seven Saints and try various whiskeys to sort out my likes and dislikes. If you (or someone you know) is trying to get into whiskey, this is a great place to do it. My personal favorites are the Elmer T. Lee and the various shades of Pappy they have (especially the Old Rip Van Winkle which is fantastic). My only quibble is that the whiskey passports are a bit of a ripoff. It's $5 for the little book, but normally that'd also come with some sort of swag (like a t-shirt or glass) when finished. It'd make a nice little memento for finishing the entire (64 entry) passport. Still, a great place and such a minor nitpick it barely merits mentioning. Seven Saints is fantastic.",

The problem is that sliders are moist / greasy. Now, I'm not saying that having a non-greasy slider is a bad thing from a healthful eating perspective.

        "review": "While traveling on business to the area, my boss and I went to Seven Saints on the recommendation of some of the local employees. \u00a0It was billed as a good place to get decent food and a good beer. \u00a0Being a fan of any and all microbrews I can get my hands on back home on the east coast I was hopeful that they would have at least some local flavor from which I could sample and some food that was palatable after a long day on a plane and in airports.We got there around 9pm and the place was very quiet (not a bad thing in my mind). \u00a0We grabbed a seat at the bar and I was immediately pleased to see Southern Tier on tap. \u00a0As a large fan of this line of beer back east but only seeing it in bottle my hope grew. \u00a0Along with that some other wonderful names graced the bar taps; Dead guy (again only bottle option for me most times), Fat Tire (a beer that was raved about by my friends after a trip west but I am unable to acquire in my local establishments), and the usual Guiness etc. \u00a0 Add to my excitement was the very well stocked liquor rail with such rarities as Hanger One Vodka (one of the best flavored vodka line) and Lafroaig 30yr (one of my all time favorite scotch brands). \u00a0The bartender was friendly and polite and took our initial beer order. \u00a0After scanning the menu i decided on what was recommended to me, the sliders. \u00a0Since I could not decide and was famished anyways i ordered 6 of the approximately 12 different varieties they offered. \u00a0While waiting for our food I struck up a conversation with our bartender asking for suggestions for good local beers. \u00a0He recommended a wonderful beer made by a small time brewery run by two brothers (the name eludes me at this point) and his recommendation was spot on. \u00a0By this time our food arrived and i dug into the various sliders. \u00a0They were a bit larger then I anticipated but not overly so. \u00a0Most came as described \u00a0and tasted good. No disappointment on the food front. \u00a0After downing my meal and finishing my second beer I asked for one more suggestion. \u00a0At this point the GM of the establishment joined us in the discussion over local breweries and suggested we try Foundry. \u00a0I choose a bourbon barrel aged brew called Backwoods Bastard. \u00a0Alliteration aside it was a wonderful way to end the meal. \u00a0We continued to talk and I was very impressed at the effort both the bartender and the GM himself put in for two random customers on a Monday night when they could have very easily just gone about closing up shop and leaving us to our devices.I have no bad things to say about this place and being a former server/bartender/cook I am not shy about voicing my expectations concerning a locale. \u00a0I would definitely recommend to anyone either passing through the area or local to the area to stop by sometime and try for yourself. \u00a0If the beer list and quality food is not enough of a draw they do offer specials on liquors and beer knocking the price down significantly for that day. \u00a0To fully appreciate this locale I highly recommend going on an off day as I am unsure how a busy saturday night would translate into appreciation for a simple yet enjoyable experience.",

        "review": "I went here for my birthday dinner upon recommendation from a friend. I agree with a previous reviewer, the ambiance of this place has a restaurant chain feel. The crowd was what looked like a mix of graduate students and older couples.Seven Saints is known for their sliders, these mini burgers, kinda like what White Castle serves. The sliders are about $3 to $4 bucks each so it's perfect for ordering a slew of them. I ordered fried cheese curds \u00a0for appetizers which were delicious though a little soggy (then again, anything fried pretty much tastes good). There are plenty of vegetarian options. Any slider can be replaced with a boca burger (50 cents extra), but in my opinion a boca burger patty overwhelms any other taste. So what you end up with is pretty same tasting burgers - my boca blackjack cheese slider tasted like my Asian one. The waffle fries were especially good though (better than The Office's ones in Urbana IMO). The beer selection is limited so this place is decent to take group for dinner - there are better bar options for drinks elsewhere. The service was adequate and attentive, but not overly so. What's with the Third Eye Blind love? There were like 3 TEB songs that played that night :S There's also some outdoor seating. I could definitely image coming back here for lunch.I also like the fact that Seven Saints is directly across from the bus/train station (who needs to spend 10 bucks on a cab when there's convenient public transportation nearby? My friends rode their bikes here and took a bus back home (they have racks on the front of the bus to load bikes).All in all, Seven Saints is a decent option for lunch and dinner, but you can find better spirits elsewhere (i.e. Blind Pig, others)",

Hey everybody has an off night! My husband and I enjoy not the run of the mill beers and we were surprised to find extensive selection at seven saints. Goose island 312 for me and fat tire for my spouse.We started our dinner off with fried cheese curds. The cheese curds were golden brown and not greasy,they come highly recommended!We each ordered 2 sliders and a side of waffle fries. I had Asian and smoked BBQ slider and Doug ordered BBQ and California turkey slider. All were cooked to perfection and delicious . They have several options when it comes to the menu so I feel there is something for everyone.

I typically came here on a date with the wife when she visited me during graduate school. We had to live separately for two years but enjoyed our evenings here before her flight home out of CMI. Although it's a whisky bar, they had an interesting selection of wine and beer. I always got the Mojo IPA and she got her Riesling. Aside from the relationship, this is also where I came to prefunk with the roommate before our Thursday night pubcrawls with the School of LER. Initially, my first roommate introduced me to this place when I first arrived to Champaign. We were paired by Burnham's roommate matching system. He was this smart computer science whiz. We drank here on weekends. He moved on to work for Skype. My second roommate was a Korean born Mexican. He was fluent in Spanish which culturally, he loved whisky. I think I was appointed as his wingman because he was this strange kimchee taco hybrid that was soaked in whisky that came off as a creeper. The Chinese Beijing girls loved him though and our strategies to get him laid all started here at Seven Saints. The irony is that, there was nothing Saint like going on at this establishment when we were there.",

It's also the place I recommend when people from out of town ask where they should go for dinner. The service there is very friendly and prompt, and the food is good. I've never had the salmon burgers, but I wouldn't expect the fish dishes to be the best in the heart of Central Illinois anyway. The Buffalo Chicken Slider and Classic Slider with Cheese are my favorites, along with a side of waffle fries (although if you're a fan of sweet potato fries, they have the best in town). The chipotle ranch sauce that comes with the onion rings is amazing, the tomato bisque is absolutely out of this world and they have a great selection of whiskey and beer at the bar. I really think of this place as more of a restaurant than a bar though. They tend to get busy on Friday and Saturday nights, and if the wait is long, make sure you're back earlier than you think if you decide to walk around the area. Definitely one of the gems in Champaign-Urbana and a place that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good meal at a decent price.",

I went to the other one back in my college days, but this one I didn't even know existed. Walked in and it's seat yourself tables to the left, a bunch of pool tables to the front, and a long bar in the middle. Very limited seating, but it wasn't packed at all so that wasn't a problem. There was a weird draft hitting our table though, so we moved to one deeper in the corner since we thought it was the door, but the draft was there too. We just had to wear our coats throughout dinner.For 6 people, we ordered 2 large pizzas, one buffalo chicken, and one prosciutto. I didn't care much for the prosciutto, but the buffalo was pretty bomb. Ordered some small ranches (50 cents per though, what a rip) and it was delicious. It's deceptive that they cut their pizzas into smaller squares because you feel like you can eat so much more. We had 6 slices left over and it was about 42-ish dollars with tax and tip. So a large probably feeds 4 people comfortably, 3 uncomfortably.Weird thing though is when we asked for a box, the waitress asked if we wanted anything else. We said no and assumed she would bring us the check. But didn't and we sat there for like 10 more minutes. Had to grab her attention and then ask for the check. We weren't drinking or anything so I'm not sure why she thought we would want to just hang out. Minor inconvenience though so it's whatever.",

A place where you can swap your favorite pizza toppings with friends, enjoy your go-to beer on the side, chat with friends, and watch the basketball game on their large TVs. They also have pool tables and arcade games. My favorite night to go is Tuesday because they have half off large pizzas and it's a popular night to go. Warning to Chicago-native-deep-dish lovers: these pizzas are thin-crust pizzas and I'm from St. Louis, so we love thin crust pizzas, but this place does not rip you off on toppings. Jupiter's specialty pizzas are great! \u00a0There's no need to stress about perfecting your pizzas toppings since they already have specialty pizzas with your already-favorite toppings. If you want to make your own crazy masterpiece, you can customize your pizza with four toppings maximum (meat toppings count as two). More importantly, the price is very reasonable. Also this place has a clean, friendly, fun atmosphere. It's definitely one of my favorite places to go in downtown champaign. I recommend every U of I student to check this place out with friends there before graduation .",

Every single time, they were very accomodating, fast, and nice.

It was nice having tons of games to play while we were waiting for the food also! Although it is pretty awesome, I give this place 4 stars because besides Tuesday nights (which are half price pizza nights!) the place is pretty pricey for thin crust pizza which is not that filling.

When I go to take my food, he says, \"you're supposed to pay with cash.\" I explained that I already paid via yelp's link for online delivery with my credit card. He said, \"it says you are paying with cash.\" I proceed to stand there for fifteen minutes, while he calls various people to finally get to the number to call to confirm my method of payment. He says, \"do you have your credit card?\" I respond, \"no.\" He says, \"you'll need it because they're going to want to confirm the payment.\" Mind you, I am in the law building. My stuff is on the other side of the law building. I am not wandering around looking for my credit card, while he calls people to confirm my payment. I just stood there. At one point, I said, just void this I don't want it. Then my hunger snapped me back to my senses. After some time on the phone, he is told I paid with my credit card already. I told him I would not be using their services again, he said \"okay.\" He walked out unaffected. Around 10 PM, I called the number on delivery.com, and heard no apologies. Thanks Bombay Grill, for providing me with the distinct pleasure of paying $23 to have cold mutter paneer and wilted garlic naan delivered to me more than 2.5 hours after I ordered it.

I had only been here once with my wife for dinner and the food was pretty spicy. The lunch special seemed enticing for 7+ dollars depending on what you order. I wish I took a picture of the menu, maybe next time. The chicken curry I ordered took a bit of time to prepare but it came out piping hot. The curry was not spicy at all which was perfect. It was rich and creamy with ample amount of chicken. The naan was simply the largest naan I have ever seen. It was perfect with the curry. You also get a potato pakora. No salad though as mentioned previously. All and all great, but if you could pay a dollar or two more for buffet at someplace else I probably would go with that for variety. The only downside of this place is that they use plastic ware and plates, but I guess this is a college town after all and I have to lower my standards. Pro: large menu with lunch specials, large naan, not too spicy curryCons: plasticware, slow serviceHidden gem: 7+ dollar lunch specials with large naan or rice and potato pakora",

I was there with 5 other friends and found that it is particularly hard to find a table that was big enough to accommodate all of us, especially during lunch time.I was surprised when I tasted their food because I thought it was gonna be really bad. It turned out to be okay although it wasn't excellent. I love their paneer makhani because the sauce was wonderfully creamy but oddly, the paneer tasted like tofu to me. I also had their lentil curry and briyani rice but that weren't as good. You have a choice of a huge naan or rice for lunch specials I think. I'd go for the NAAN if I were you.Expect to spend at least $7 or $8 for vegetarian dishes and more for meats. For the amount of food that they give, the prices are a little steep in my opinion. It's usually the naan that fills me up, not the curry.Updated 5/10/08:I was there for dinner and I realized that it was a completely different experience in the evening. For lunch, you order your food and pay at the cash register. When the food is ready, they will serve it to you in styrofoam plates and plastic cutleries. For dinner, it becomes a sit-down restaurant with table service, cute waitresses, and food served on china and silverware. A stark difference, eh?",

The food is great, and it's really cheap at lunch - for $6.99 you can get an enormous amount of your entree, plus either the biggest piece of naan in history OR a giant pile of rice OR some of both, plus a couple pakoras and a salad. What? Fabulous. And it is more than enough food to last for two meals, which is another huge plus.In case that weren't enough, they frequently give me free stuff. I don't totally understand why. I'm not really a regular, and I'm not a supermodel. If this place were on the east coast, I'd guess it was because I'm polite, but this is Champaign, where everyone says \"please\" and \"thank you\" and smiles. So...I don't really understand it, but every time I go there, I get some of another entree, or an extra piece of naan, or a dessert, or a soda. Maybe everybody gets free stuff. Whatever. I'm not one to look a gift daal in the mouth.",

I only wish it came with more chicken and less of the lentil side and gigantic naan. Don't get me wrong, the naan here is great, but more of that chicken would be better.

I was pretty excited because it was drowned in delicious brown, basil sauce and had large bamboo shoots. I totally would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't obvious that the chicken was the normal breaded chicken breast bits used in every other chicken dish Chinese fast food restaurants have. Three-cup chicken should be made with chicken on the bone, with the meat nearly falling off because it has been simmered lovingly. Apparently, my expectations were too high--my bad. The crab ragoon came out nearly at the end of the meal, which caused me much confusion because I had forgotten about it. Nearly burnt to a crisp, but still fried wanton skins filled mayo..can't go wrong with it. I'll come back, and with lowered expectations I am sure I will enjoy myself more.",

I would note their menu has an unspoken distinction between the Westernized and more authentic items, which is easy to find- simply note there are two chicken sections and the Westernized contains the familiar items like Kung Pao and Sesame. Try the other section. What keeps me coming back is the Taiwanese Salt and Pepper chicken I randomly ordered off the \"authentic\" section of the menu. It's crispy pieces of peppery chicken fried in ginger. It's wonderful and unlike anything I've ever had.

My favorite dishes here are the \"3 Cup Chicken\" aka \"San Bei Ji\", the tofu dishes such as \"Ma Po Do Fu\", and the snowfish that comes out over a flame.The owner is always very accommodating, but keep in mind that I place my table reservations at least two weeks ahead of the dinner.On the days we have the dinner, the owner even let us bring some of our own celebratory big bottles of sake. Although at the expense of her restaurant (no liquor license :X), we really appreciated the gesture of accommodating guests!Even my super-white Illinois-raised friends and classmates all agree that Lai Lai has the most authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food in the area.

Decently priced too. I love the Gan Chao Niu He (dry-fried beef chow fun) because it's never too oily but it's still super tasty.

Nice sauce, and the meat was falling off the bone. Good stuff!The orange chicken was crispy and spicy and included the elusive but much wanted \"candied orange peel\" - caramelized the way I like it :-)It was nice that we could hop up and get refills on water and hot tea - I've seen few places that will do this. I've been ignored plenty while eating at \u00a0Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants - I don't think it's rudeness - it's usually that the kitchen is busy and the restaurant is understaffed.We ate late, and were one of three tables. Our service was prompt and good. I think that sometimes you might have to get someone's attention to place an order - not the end of the world by any means for me based on my experiences eating in many restaurants in Chicago.We had leftovers for 2 meals to take home. It's nice that the take-out boxes are easy to find and are self-service.

I typically don't like thick noodles, but my mom does so I went with it and I have no regrets about it. I think there was maybe a little too much sauce in the sliced chicken entree and it was a really strong flavor, but I was starving so it didn't phase me. They don't provide chopsticks unless you ask for them... or if you're Asian. lame! Their hot tea was really good too. I wasn't a huge fan of the seating because it kind of seemed like a fast food restaurant in the front and with the tables and there was a weird sign saying: \"Please clean your table for the next customer.\" Super confusing...

        "review": "This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area. I've been coming here ever since I landed in this town about 5 years ago; and the keyword that sticks out in my mind when describing this place is: consistency. No matter how many times I come here the food is always delicious and never lets me down. With so many different, competing Chinese restaurants just in Campustown alone, this place must be something special for me to say it's my favorite in the area, thus proving that not all Chinese places are the same.The food I feel is the most authentic Chinese food I've had ever since moving down, and also provides the best quality food, comparing right on top with my other favorite Chinese restaurant back up north in the suburbs (China House, Schaumburg, IL). \u00a0The food is very fresh and stands out as being the only place I've been to on campus that doesn't come out greasy and flavor masked in an oily feeling in the mouth. The flavor pops with every dish and portion size is pretty generous. \u00a0My favorite dish is anything from the pan fried noodle section. The noodles come out perfect, and as the sauce sinks in, you get a nice balance of crispy and soft-flavor soaked noodles. \u00a0It also comes with a hefty amount of vegetables (bak choy is a plus) and lot of protein (depending on which you got). \u00a0I always surprise whoever I come with because they are always thrown off by the portion size (which is huge). \u00a0Some other dishes that stand out are the Orange chicken (as my friend, who I brought, said it was the best he had in the area). \u00a0Another note, the wait staff is pretty on or off. \u00a0Usually when I go, the only time I see the 'waiter' or owner is when they bring out the food. You have to get your own water/tea and ask for additional items (ie. more rice) at the counter. \u00a0It's not too bad, since it only takes an extra second to do all that. \u00a0Plus it's unlimited tea, and that makes up for it. \u00a0Overall, really good Chinese food and definitely recommend this place to everybody in the area. \u00a0Hopefully, you'll have the same experience I had.",

That being said, I have had some hit or miss experiences with both the food and the service while I have been there. Most recently, I had dinner with my family there to celebrate my graduation for the University of Illinois. We had put in a reservation for our party well in advance and paid a substantial deposit. We showed up slightly early for the reservation and still had to wait almost an hour after the designated time. We were repeatedly told that it wouldn't be much longer, but by the time our party got to the table we were starving and pretty tired of being there. While I recognized that graduation is a very hectic time for people, I just did not understand what the point of making a reservation was when we had to wait as long as people who walked in the door. Once we were seated, the service was a little slow but was much more reasonable. Everyone enjoyed the food, which was flavorful and filling. Our favorite item was some sort of crab hushpuppies that were simply phenomenal. However, on other occasions, I have ordered fish dishes and found them to be somewhat bland. Overall, this place is a nice place to eat if you're looking for somewhere with a fancy vibe in Urbana. However, I would steer clear of it for important events (parents weekends, graduation, homecoming and other peak times) and check the menu before you go to ensure that the food suits your tastes.",

Definitely a stressful and extremely unpleasant dream.Graduation day at U of I. Reservations were made far in advance. We had a 9pm reservation with a $50 required deposit. When we walked in a few minutes before 9, we found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with angry and annoyed patrons. We spoke to several people who had been waiting to be seated 1, 2, and even 2 and a half hours AFTER their reservation time. They know how to take a reservation, just not how to keep the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation.So, due to the $50 required credit card deposit, all those people were stuck waiting and waiting and waiting. After waiting an hour, we asked what would happen if we left, and they said they would charge us $50. I'm pretty sure this wouldn't hold up in a court of law, but the small claims filing fee is more than $50 so they have people hooked. When we were finally seated an hour and a half after our \"reservation\" time, the 5 of us were squished into a small booth with a chair at the end. There was no space for that chair. It was very uncomfortable. Were our drinks comped? Were we offered anything for our long wait? No. The server was very nice, but we were starved and exhausted and really annoyed. The food was great, but way overpriced. I had \"little parcels\" pasta filled with cheese. Really great. The taste was worth 5 stars. I find management's policy on the U of I graduation date coupled with their failure to keep reservations absolutely unacceptable. It is completely unnecessary, their restaurant would be packed skipped reservations or not. The management decided to take this opportunity to swindle people.",

The wait was not 10 minutes, but more like an hour. Every time we asked for an update we were assured that we would be seated in a few minutes... After we sat down we waited more than an hour to get our food. Mostly what we ordered were salads, so there's no way it should have taken that long. \u00a0After about an hour they offered us some chips...The food was decent but expensive, as they upped the prices for their special graduation weekend menu. I probably would not have cared so much about the money, had we not had to wait for so long...for salads.Yes, I understand that it was graduation weekend, but the host should not have promised seating in 10 minutes, just to keep us from leaving. It was clear that they had more business than they could handle, but just wanted the opportunity to make as much money as possible. By the way, people who had reservations didn't seem to fare much better...and they had to put down a $50 deposit just to reserve a table.By the way, I went to several other restaurants that weekend with my boyfriend and his parents, including Bread Company, Biaggi's, and Big Grove, which were just as swamped as Silvercreek and received much better service in all of them.

Proceeds go to the Daily Bread Soup Kitchen. 3 STARS: The soup and bread was so phenomenal that my husband I decided to try Easter brunch at Silvercreek. Not the cheapest buffet, but we thought the food would be excellent based on our experience with soup and bread.The appetizers and the main course were all good, especially the prime rib. BUT \u00a0the desserts offered were way sub-par compared to the quality of the main course and appetizers. With the exception of the vanilla bread pudding, which was very good, and the berry cobbler, which I did not have because it was gone, the assorted desserts seemed like they were NOT made fresh from scratch. Honestly, these were desserts that would be seen at a church potluck with friends rather than at the type of restaurant Silvercreek projects.It was very disappointing because I look forward to desserts. I eat less \"real\" food because I want to eat more desserts.1 STAR: After our brunch experience, I emailed the restaurant telling them our experience and mainly asking if the desserts offered at Easter brunch were representative of the dessert menu at Silvercreek.I received NO response, so I don't know. Even at Courier Cafe (same owner), I can't bring myself to order dessert (other than milkshakes).",

It's never my choice-- Champaign has a handful of restaurants where everyone goes when they're looking for a somewhat upscale experience and Silvercreek falls into this category. And so I find myself here for graduation celebrations, birthdays, meals for when relatives are visiting, and so on. Most of my experiences here have been for their Sunday buffet brunch. They offer your standard biscuits, gravy, bacon, potatoes, as well as some lunch-ier fare like pasta and prime rib. It is all less than mediocre. Last time I was there for brunch, my dad said, \"We should have gone to Ryan's.\" Ouch. They have a pretty big selection of desserts. It really grinds my gears that even though they have an omelet and waffle station, they can't make eggs to order because they only have a big bowl of premade egg mix on hand. So yeah, no fresh eggs on hand. They have scrambled eggs in the buffet line but... gross. Side note, try not to get seated by the omelet station. It gets boiling hot. Last time I was here, I actually dunked my cloth napkin in my water and dabbed my face and neck with it. I mentioned the heat to the hostess on the way out-- she asked how the meal was-- and her response was \"Oh, in the greenhouse? Yeah, hot day.\" No, not in the greenhouse. But that reminds me...My best friend had her bridal shower at Silvercreek about a year ago, in the greenhouse. In the middle of the meal, one of the chandeliers DROPPED FROM THE CEILING and shattered on the middle of a table. Unreal.

The service is good, although knowledge of the wine list could be better (from both servers so far). The menu is really interesting, with a lot of options, and some cool creative twists on some meals which would otherwise be your typical American bistro fare. Prices are worth it, HUGE portions (generally speaking-but the pork chop especially is Massive and the Hangar steak notsomuch).I fully intend on going back, frequently.",

Based on the good reviews and seemingly more upscale menu, I thought this would be a nicer restaurant with good decor and great food. Well, not so much. My friend and I showed up around 7:30 on a Friday night and the place was only about half full. That should have been our first hint. The restaurant has a rather strange look what with the exposed brick and ceiling beams combined with the country-style tables, carpet, and booths. Overall, it just looked a little dated and old, especially the booths that were in a bit of disrepair. The dinner menu isn't huge and has a handful of selections for seafood, steaks, and pasta. I opted for the potato-crusted whitefish. It came with a cream sauce, asparagus, mushrooms, and carrots. It came out nicely presented, but when I lifted up the outer potato crust and got a glimpse of the actual fish I was so annoyed. I'm not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that piece of fish was 2x2 inches. Maybe you're not supposed to notice that with all the potato lumped on top of it, but at $18 that was absolutely ridiculous. My friend said her lobster mac and cheese was good, but so rich she could only eat half. And, BTW, it was corkscrew pasta, not macaroni.Sadly, I didn't order a salad because those actually looked pretty good. And there was also a good looking maple banana cake, but I refused to spend any more money there so I can't attest to the desserts.

We were craving pho, and normally we go to Cravings for that but he had come here with his boss and swore it was better here. Noting the couple in front of us eating the beef version of pho I got excited. We ordered the seafood pho.When it came I noticed there was something immediately wrong: the noodles looked suspiciously like Top Ramen egg noodles instead of rice noodles but I dug in cos I was so hungry. My boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different. It also had no garnish (bean sprouts, basil), no lime, and there was no oil that normally comes in the soup. When we inquired the lack of garnish or lime, we were informed by a very nervous waitress that our pho was \"special\". We then asked for srirarcha (sp?) and got a tiny dollop of it. All in all we paid $16 for beef Top Ramen with seafood floating in it. It was very salty and unpleasant. I felt disgusted that I actually ate half since I was so hungry.Multiple theories as to why we were treated this way. The couple in front of us had the beef pho and it had the garnish and the lime/oil and rice noodles.1) We didn't look Asian enough: I'm Filipino Italian (look at my profile picture) and my boy is Filipino but could pass for Latino sometimes. They were too cheap to serve us the real thing or thought they could get away with serving us the ramen since we \"didn't know any better anyway\".2) They were out of ingredients and were too lazy to bother telling us \u00a0and offer alternatives or a refund.3) A combination of number 1 and 2.I guess it serves us right for going into a Chinese restaurant for pho but Cravings serves multiple Asian dishes as well and they got it right. What made us the most angry is the fact that the Asian couple in front of us got exactly what they wanted and we left unsatisfied. My boy swears he got good soup there but his boss is more Asian looking and could be the reason why they got it right. NEVER AGAIN STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!",

I am usually not a huge fan of these, but theirs are pretty decent and sweeter than I remember. 3) shrimp crepes - pretty good...I would have liked more shrimp though 4) chicken feet - cooked really well; these were pretty big and more filling then I think is typical 5) Spare Ribs - they came in a sauce that I can't really remember the name of, but it was good and not too salty 6) Turnip Cake - probably my favorite, but I always love it :) 7) Congee - this came with a pork sausage which was tasty. I was getting pretty full at this point, but the congee was good enough to keep me going... The place also has really good jasmine and chrysanthemum tea, which is refreshing on a chilly day :)The only thing I wish they did here was use the carts, but it is a small place and they serve other items then Dim Sum so I understand...",

We were actually heading over to Ihop, but saw that Mandarin Wok had dim sum, so we stopped in.I've never experienced this type of service before - or lack there of. They bring the food out to you and plates, but everything else is up to you. Get your own drinks (chrysanthemum tea, jasmine tea, or water), your own utensils, your own sauce (they had packaged soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce, usually not what I use for dim sum), and you have to get up and order at the cashier.They should really put a sign up or make sure people know to order, a family walked in while we were half way done with our dim sum, and they just sat there. The girl who was working wasn't doing anything important but she didn't even walk over to them, give them a menu, or anything until the man called for her.Anywho, the dim sum just reaches the bare minimum for passing off as an okay meal. Perhaps in a small town it's good, but it doesn't compare to Chinatown in the Chi.There wasn't a lot of options, only about 25 items. My favorite thing for dim sum is shrimp crepes and turnip cake. Both of which were disappointing! The shrimp crepe only had two small pieces of shrimp. The turnip cake was just off, seemed like it wasn't cooked right. \u00a0The shui mai and shrimp dumpling were small, but it tasted fine.Not entirely saddened by this experience because at least it wasn't expensive.

The waitresses were yelling and the tables were still dirty from the customers who had left. We went up to the counter to order, but she told us to sit down with our menu. We saw a bunch of people walk in and order at the counter so we filled in our sheet and brought it up. At this point it was about 12:30 before she even took our sheet because the waitress were taking care of the customers who had just walked in. So we sat there and waited, and waited and waited. 30 minutes had gone by and nothing. 40 minutes. Nothing. We were very upset because we only had a short lunch break. About 43 minutes later, our first dish came out. Slowly, our little dim sum dishes came out. One by One. Our dishes were being thrown on the table without care and the waitress just left without telling us what it was. We went up to get some hot tea as well and both containers were completely empty. We to complain and the manager said that this was a new girl and she didn't really have a handle on things yet. Our last dish came about 45 minutes later from our first dish. A few of the dim sum dishes were really tasty, but it did not make up for lack of management and service skill. I do not think that I'll ever be returning.",

We got there at 7 and had to wait around 20ish minutes to get a table but they had a seating system where they text you when they're ready for you so it wasn't a big deal. The Atmosphere:The restaurant itself is beautiful, modern and minimalist. It is a bit small but I personally enjoy that vibe at a sushi restaurant; it usually means that the kitchen can take the time needed to make the food for you. The Food/Drink:I was not very thrilled with the drink menu. I really wanted some nigori sake but it was $45 for a bottle, a bit much. We ended up getting a bottle of makgeolli and some beers. As for the food we got steamed gyozas (had to ask for them to be steamed because they are on the menu as fried) and 4 different sushi rolls: shrimp tempura, Philadelphia, Sakanaya, and the Windy City. We were satisfied with the gyozas and all of the rolls but especially enjoyed the sakanaya and windy city rolls, definitely a repeat order item. The fish was fresh and the rolls looked extremely appetizing the way that they were presented. The service: This is the only part of the restaurant I wasn't thrilled about. Our waitress was a bit cold and seemed like she was going out of her way every time we asked something.

But man are we glad we did.The place has a really relaxed lounge-like atmosphere, and a very modern feel. There aren't a lot of tables, so there's usually a wait during dinner hours, but they take your cell phone number and text you when your table is ready. So you're free to wander around a bit if you want while you wait.The menu is admittedly a bit pricey, but the portions are generous and filling. The first time I was here, I got the bul-goki, which came with a mountain of delicious marinated beef, a salad, and a few pieces of sushi. I can eat a lot, and I still couldn't quite finish!If you have some spare cash to burn and are looking for a delicious and flavorful dinner, this is a place that should be high on your list.",

The sake was cheap and plentiful enough to make the wait less of a big deal. We finished off our meal with the deep-fried chicken wings from their late-night menu. Quite good! To sneak in one final nitpick, though: the place tries very hard to make itself seem like a big-city sushi joint with its ambiance, and by that I mean music was blaring pretty loud through the speakers during our meal, making it hard to carry on quiet conversation.",

I was a little hesitant though since there were no elite reviews and some of the reviews seem like fakes, but here's mine. Hopefully you can trust me.I walked in and it looks really nice, nice decorations and everything, just really small. Put our name in and waited probably 20 minutes or so to be seated. People love their sushi on a Saturday night I guess. I recommend calling for a reservation, and don't plan on coming if you have more that 4 people since there's barely enough tables as is. From what I read, the ramen was pretty good. My friend told me that too and the waiter said that's what they were known for so that sounded good to me. The gf and I both got ramen, forgot what their names were though. We did have different broths though and I liked mine better. Hers was the first one listed and mine was the second. I'm definitely a fan of this. I usually don't like ramen since you can pay 10 cents and make it in the microwave as opposed to paying 13 bucks for this one, but this was good. Meat was even tender and the dish as a whole was pretty solid.We also ordered a sakanaya roll which was recommended by our waiter. Guess the sushi was backed up since it took a while for it to get out to us. To be honest I wasn't really a fan. Tasted fine but wasn't anything special. It was room temperature, so it just makes me think that it was sitting out for a while, but hey that may be your cup of tea, who knows. But anyway, 4 stars for the ramen dishes pretty much.",

Seared scallop with bonito flakes tops the roll and it has salmon, crab meat, and avocado (okay, so a really glorified Cali roll), but it's very tasty and presented gorgeously. It's around $14, so be ready to part with your cash! The treat is definitely worth it though.The ramen is delicious, albeit pricey. Huge portions of everything are in your ramen. My only complaint is that some of my ramen noodles had a strange. mild soapy taste. The pork broth had a strong, savory flavor, and I recommend getting the tonkotsu ramen. The slices of pork and veggies are also generous, which I really liked. It's not the best ramen I've ever had, so I don't think the price is warranted. The interior is very small and a bit cramped when it's full of people coming in and out, so be ready to be bumped a bit or squeeze by people at dinner. However, the staff are polite and do their best to stay organized; they use an iPad system to keep track of orders and tables, and they wait in the back or to the side while on standby to avoid collisions. I think it's considerate because the wait might take a while (even with a reservation), so you can walk around on Green Street and they'll call you when a table opens up.So far it's the only place on campus that has good ramen, so I suppose I could say I'm a fan.",

It's about what you'll pay at any restaurant, except maybe street vendors or whatnot. Anyways, the ramen is decent, not amazing. It's probably the best you'll find on campus. What makes the ramen? The broth. Being the snob I am, I asked for a little bit of each ramen's broth but was told that they make the broth with each bowl of ramen. Hmm. Some flags when up there. Regardless, I tried both the soy based and chicken based broths and found there was really nothing special about either of them. Again, if you're looking for ramen this place is the best bet, but don't expect anything spectacular.The sushi was what I was more impressed with, as every single place on campus was disappointing me (apart from Cheese and Crackers who imports their fish overnight) but the fish was surprisingly fresh and they gave me considerable chunks of fish for my nigiri. Delicious white tuna by the way.I'd definitely go back for the sushi. If they ever change the ramen or I'm super desperate for some at 2:00 AM or something I'll give this place another try.*Also there were little things I really liked about the place like the atmosphere, the little pipettes they use for soy sauce, and especially the fact that they give you an entire jug of water for your table.",

Both rolls were nicely presented. Fatty salmon is my weakness, and Sakanaya's is very expensive per piece ($9!) but it was pretty worth it tonight. While it wasn't the best piece I've ever had, it was still melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you ever get the chance, you need to try fatty salmon! For the rest of our meal, we had tonkatsu ramen. I have to say, I wasn't blown away by the ramen. I'd give it three stars. The broth was the right color and consistency, but it really lacked the richness and pork flavor that tonkatsu ramen should have. It just tasted a little thin and bland. Definitely need to work on that. The noodles themselves were nice and chewy, so no complaints about that. Meat was tasty, but cut pretty thin. Thumbs down for the egg, which was hard boiled and cold... Skimpy on the bamboo shoots. I was happy about the noodles, but the rest of the ramen was just okay. Overall, I'd give Sakanaya 3.5 stars.

I had a tempura shrimp roll, and it was 7 pieces deep, all big and overflowing with everything you'd want in a roll. But let's talk about the fact that the ownership actually put some care and attention to the details about the way this place looks. Fact is, humans are very much moved by their environment, and Sakanaya designed this place to be an experience. I will gladly pay the prices on the menu to eat this type of fare in a really beautiful space. All others can hit up Panda Express. Enjoy. Nice work, Sakanaya. Really impressive.

With an extensive menu of appetizers, fresh sashimi, sushi rolls, shoyu + miso ramen, and other korean dishes, you will definitely have to take some time to look over the menu. I would have to say that the sushi was the freshest I've ever tasted in Urbana-Champaign. Being from Florida, my standards for sushi are a bit high and have been disappointed over the past 2.5 years I have been living in the CU, but Sakanaya does not disappoint. Location is ideal as it is right on Green Street, the heart of the UofI campus. Parking can be hectic though. ($0.75/hr) Parking is free after 9pm and free on Sundays. There was a line the entire time we were there, but service was fast and friendly, so the line was constantly moving. Also, we went after opening day. The interior and exterior is very appealing, but the inside is a bit smaller than I would have imagined. The tables are pretty close to each other. The man next to our table was sitting alone, listening on our conversation and occasionally talked to us. Prices are a bit more expensive than I thought. Since it is catering to mostly college students, thinking of one's budget, the ramen bowl would've been nice at $8, instead of the $12. Portion size is good - shared a shoyu ramen bowl and kamakazi (sushi roll) with a friend and we were satisfied. (But there was still room left for dessert.) Ramen broths are pork-based. The pork melts in your mouth and the broth isn't too salty or bland - just right. It was a bit lukewarm though, but that's just preference. I like my soups really hot. The salmon on the kamakazi was really soft and melted in your mouth too. Definitely fresh. Tl;dr? - Sushi and ramen are good. Get it. - Atmosphere is romantic. Definitely a date night kind-of place. - Worth the experience/trip, not worth the price. Would've been better if it was $4 cheaper. Where else can you buy authentic Japanese ramen here, anyway?",

It doesn't get a huge amount of foot traffic through it and is located on the border of one of the sketchier areas in Champaign, but the food is good for what you pay for. A typical entree might be $8-9 (which is expensive for Champaign IMO). But you also do get lots of food. My favorite dish here is Beef Pad See Ewe which is the long noodles with broccoli, bok choy, and beef. Put a little siracha sauce on it and you have a really tasty dish.The restaurant is family owned and they seem to be there all the time. They are really good about phone orders and being fairly quick about bringing dishes out, though sometimes they might forget something. You just have to have thick skin when going into the place, because you might not get the best service.The downside of this place is that it just seems a little bit dirty. The tables are a bit grimey even after they wipe them down. And you have to clean up everything yourself.

This place is really easy to miss because it is a tiny building that does not look anything like a Thai restaurant.The restaurant was completely empty when we got there but while we were eating there was a steady stream of people coming in to order take out. We ordered the Tom Yun Koong, Yum Nuau, and Jungle Curry.Tom Yun Koong is a soup that is exactly the same as the traditional Tom Yum soup found at all Thai restaurants and it came with shrimp. \u00a0The soup was delicious, but definitely not the best I have ever had. It had the prefect amount of heat, the shrimp were not overcooked, and the vegetables were nice and crispy.Yum Nuau is a spicy beef salad. I always order this dish when i go to a Thai restaurant and I have to admit that this salad had some sort of different spice which was very tasty. Again, it was not the best I have ever had but it was deliciously unique. All the vegetables in the salad were super fresh and the quality of the beef was excellent. Jungle Curry was very confusing though. It came in a big bowl with a ton of fresh vegetables and wonderfully seasoned chicken but the sauce was some sort of chicken broth with seasonings. I thought that they brought me the wrong dish but sure enough it was the Jungle \"curry\" that I had ordered. This was the first time I was served a curry dish which did not consist of coconut milk.

It was a scene worthy of a movie - dramatic music, slow-mo closeups of pad thai flying everywhere, and fat tears of epiphany rolling down my cheeks to salt up my food. Not that the food needed any more salt or additional seasoning anyway. In direct contrast to the squat (one could even go so far as to call it ugly) exterior, the dishes are pure decadence in your mouth. Yes, the pad thai is awesome but people, let's stroll down some paths less taken, shall we? Pad see ew is also good, though in my opinion, perhaps a bit too much sauce. My favorites would have to be the Golden Fried Rice (offered only on their Shining White Board of Specials) and the Beef Noodle Soup. The Golden Fried Rice is curried, pineappled, raisined, egged goodness. Sounds weird but the lesson here is \"never judge a book by its cover\", remember? The Beef Noodle Soup is perhaps a direct cousin of Vietnamese pho. I've never been quite sure whether to go ahead and give it the pho label because it just never seems quite..... pho-y enough. But irregardless of labels, its exactly what I find myself ordering when it's blizzarding and I just want some hot broth and flavorful noodles to fill me up. The curries are also excellent. Hell, just go ahead and order everything. I'm pretty sure you can't lose.Could it get any better? Why yes, it can, rhetorical question asker. With giant portion sizes!

I don't know what they used to season it but somehow it tasted like dish water. There was no clear broth flavor with star of anise or hint of cinnamon. It just tasted very off and I could not stomach more than a spoon of the soup.

See my previous review.Wednesday: Basil Chicken - the sauce makes it. Mix it with the rice!Thursday: Yellow Curry. Very oily, probably because I had it very spicy and they added lots of chili oil. Comes with a huge chunk of rice - very filling. The curry itself was okay, frankly, I'm not much of a curry person.Friday: Pad Ke Mao. I got this with beef, and it was great. The noodles were well done, a decent amount of meat and veg, and the sauce is AMAZING. Couldn't get enough.I'd rank these, from most favorite to least favorite: Pad Ke Mao, Basil Chicken, Fried Rice, Pad Thai, Yellow Curry.If you regularly eat spicy food and have a reasonable tolerance, go for spice level 6 - it's just the right amount of kick.I mentioned in my previous review that the to-go containers are lined with foil. Apparently not always, because mine didn't have it today. Even worse, the woman that put my box in the bag did not think that I would actually carry the bag by the handles, because the box would be 90 degrees to the ground when carrying (with the opening facing directly down) - I didn't notice until it was too late, and now my bag is full of the sauce, which is the best part of the dish. :( It was a pain to clean it up and I'm unhappy I didn't get to eat any sauce, and it is why I'm docking one star.With that issue aside, I'm so happy with this place, but at the same time, unhappy, because it took until my senior year to try this place out!

One no longer had to travel to downtown Urbana to Xin Xin Cafe for pho. The staff are all extremely friendly and am not afraid to chat with you despite their slight language barrier. They are always cheerful and if there's something wrong with the order, they immediately replace it without further questions asked. Definitely a place worthy of regular visits!",

The price is fairly cheap for the portions at this place which is great for college students. I would come back here for food but not for the pho. I'm only giving three stars because of two reasons. One of them is that I ordered the Thai iced tea for almost $3 and I expecting to have some refreshing authentic Thai iced tea, but instead it was a really small bottled one from the fridge which was pretty disappointing and not worth $3. The woman behind the cashier said \"I'm too lazy to make a real one,\" as her excuse. My second reason is that the restaurant was way too humid and hot with the doors open on a humid rainy day. I was sweating uncomfortably while eating my hot pho and it was unpleasant. There were workers fixing the ceiling tiles or something nearby too, which I thought was unacceptable for when people are eating around them only a few feet away. The food was good, the atmosphere not so much. I will still be coming back for a quick Thai fix because it's so accessible and conveniently located on Green st.",

The drinks were outstanding.We were initially seated inside, but chose to switch to outside once the rain had completely passed and the tables and chairs were wiped dry. Five people had some sort of taco meal and I had steak Mesquite Fajitas. Everyone seemed to enjoy the tacos. The fajitas were not sizzling as one would normally expect. They were just okay.Service at Wedge was exceptional! Although the interior was already crowded, our waitress was attentive inside and remained so once we moved outside.I had not been particularly tempted to go to Wedge since tequila has traditionally upset my stomach. However, I did try some habanero tequila, which was very good -- with no bad effects!We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday girl got a free tequila shot after dinner. Not bad.All in all, we had a delightful evening and will surely return -- perhaps to try one of the many different dinner specials that Wedge has throughout the week.",

The bar tenders are cute and friendly with their own edgy styles. The wait staff, young and professional with good knowledge of menu items. I decided to give this place a try after reading reviews on it. It was a grey cloudy day and it had just finished raining, as cute as it looked, outside seating was out of the question. But just to let you know, it is available. It is a seat yourself place, So I plopped at the bar, quickly greeted and met with a drink menu. By the by, all cocktails are only $6 on hump day.. \u00a0I love me some margaritas. The spicy pineapple margarita was my choice tonight and I had that to enjoy while looking over the menu. Finally decided to have the steak torta, carnitas taco, chips and ranchero guacamole. There was no stagnant wait time to place my order as the bartender was very attentive despite the semi crowded bar. It was about give minutes later, boom, my chips come out. The chips are a crunchy kind of good. There are three kinds of guacamole in which I ordered the chunky spicy kind. It was a perfect accompaniment with my drink and anticipation for my meal. Before I can get halfway down my drink and just as I got over the chips, tada... Here comes my food. The timing couldn't be any more spot on. The steak torta was very tasty. It was seasoned and moist with the toasted bread just crisp. The sandwich was pretty darn good. On the plate were also potato wedges that came with aioli dip. Without the dip, the wedges were.. meh. It's all about that dip. Done with my first drink, I gave the bar tender a nod and boom another one came. Completed my steak, on to my taco. The carnitas or pork, was a bit dry and it was just ok. Following the steak, it wasn't great. Finished it anyway, dipped it in the guac and poured salsa on it. That did the trick. Munched on the chips some more as I wrote this review. The environment is clean, friendly and inviting. The wait staff is awesome. The food is great. And the prices are reasonable. The music is trendy and relatively current.

Their fajitas, though, seemed old (not even sizzling when brought out, although still hot-ish). The meat was about 3/4 fat, instead of meat, so eating the fajita tacos was more of a task than enjoying a meal since I had to pull out the fat. I think if I go back, I'll definitely stick to the tacos. Tried the pineapple and mango jalapeno margaritas...the mango is definitely more spicy than the pineapple. Both were decent, though.---the Monday margarita flight is amazing!! Also, the Monday taco special is great. I'd definitely recommend getting tacos when you come here, but steer clear of the steak!

If you're a guacamole fan, you will love this place! Place an order for the guac and you will be delighted with the freshness of the guacamole and the freshly fried chips. The chips are crispy, light, and seem homemade (I'm betting they are and if they are not, we need to figure out the brand and get our grubs on them ASAP). I'm not sure about others, but I could just have guacamole for dinner....The menu, on the whole, is on the smaller end, but what you do get is elevated food. What I mean by elevated is: slightly couture food (yea, let's call it that). My tacos came with really delicious pickled veggies, and nicely cooked rice. One criticism of the menu: there are only two vegetarian dishes, but that being said, the two that they have (both tacos) are pretty fabulous. The service here is great, I might add. However, the best part is the ambiance and the vibe. Wedge has a wonderful outdoor area for sitting and dining, bar dining inside, and also typical sit down type dining. Whatever experience you're looking for, they have it here. If you're stopping through, or if your a newbie (like myself), I would highly recommend Wedge!",

I have been wanting to try it after hearing about all the different drinks and tequilas they had, but all that waiting was in vain. First off, I made a reservation, but was placed under a tent in \u00a0a parking lot on a 45 degree evening. It was warm when we first walked in, but were placed in the back where there were no heater lamps and the temperature was unbearable. We asked to be moved to a table closer to the one functioning heater lamp and were accommodated by the staff (although, in hindsight I wish we wouldn't have been so we would have gotten out then). After being comfortable for about ten minutes the lamp was moved to the back so we were freezing again, but by that point we were ready to leave. We ordered apps to start and got salsa and the ranchero guac. The salsa was good, but the guac was TERRIBLE. it was as cold as the wind blowing under the tent and despite the menu listing it as guacamole with pico de gallo and queso, there was no cheese visible or to taste and as many chunks of tomato and onion as corn (which coincidentally is not supposed to be in this version of guacamole). This led us to believe that they just made one large batch that they could serve as any of the three sub par renditions and stored it in a freezer all day. My drink (the diablo) was satisfactory. My boyfriend ordered the traditional margarita that included patron, patron citronage, orange liqueur and agave nectar. It tasted awful and they upcharged 50 cents for his request of Don Julio Blanco, which is acceptable, but then he was randomly charge $3 for Grand Marnier out of the blue. At that point it wasn't even worth dealing with so we paid and left. Their menu looks pretty good until you start tasting the food, but an individual taco is $3 and a platter of 5 tacos is $15...not a mathematician but that's not really a deal...actually it's not a deal at all. BOTTOM LINE: just don't do it. The food is wanna be upscale but is a flat out miss. The drinks are interesting, but seem to be a crapshoot depending on the specific cocktail.",

We ordered a number of dishes and everything was bland or awful. The chips were stale, the ceviche flavorless, the salsa watery, and the wedge salad was the worse we ever had. (How do you mess up a wedge salad? ). On top of the bad food....service was slow. And, we sat on the patio next to a chain smoker. On our way home we stopped by another restaurant to 'erase' the bad memories from our palates. We normally enjoy dining out downtown was bar far the worst experience we've ever had.",

Was this worth a \"date night\" with my husband ? Not really. When you have to pay for a baby-sitter a date night better be worth it! Wedge was more miss than hit for us, and while it wasn't terrible, it just isn't worth a repeat for us, especially since we can't really come here with our son - too bar-like b/c most of the tables have high bar stools. There are better (casual and pricy) places for a date in C-U. Pros:The server was great! Mixed up a fancy N/A juice for me since I'm pregnant. The fish tacos- very good- loved the sauce especially. But go easy on the cabbage!The steak tacos w/ poblano - good.Beer prices were reasonable.Meh: Tacos al Pastor - decent, but not worth a repeat visit, IMO. Guacamole - decent flavor- a bit too acidic, not enough salt.Cons: Chips and salsa are NOT free - it's $3 for an order!Beans - fresh out of a.... Can. So easy to make good beans, no excuses here.Guacamole price was high compared to other places around town (and yes, I know the cost of an avocado $0.90-1.79/each- esp owning the El Toros in town, I'm sure the owners get them cheaper than we can at Meijer. Price was $6 for a small portion that was *maybe*a single avocado. Seated right by the door - kept getting interrupted so servers could get liquor out, new patrons walking in - it was freezing! Forget a \u00a0nice date - we were cold and felt *very* rushed. If you want to get drinks and linger, or dessert, sit in the back. If you want a Jimmy Johns \"Freaky Fast\" experience, sit in the front. Carnitas taco - absolutely disgusting. It tasted like the meat was rotten. The nuts were whole and just didn't work \u00a0- would be better chopped up, but they dont' really add to the taco. This actually made me feel sick. My husband agreed.",

I am so sorry I will have the GM call you back.\" I did not think anything of it at the time because I understand it could be anything.)I called, with no mean intentions, to inform them that I, as well as the doctor I went to see at Carle Clinic, were 95% positive that Wedge was the source of this foodborne illness, and the doctor assured me it was NOT the flu. \u00a0Wedge did not return my 3 calls until 3 days later, and the GM's response was that \"I'm pretty confident we are not the source.

The drinks are reasonably priced for the location and atmosphere, and the bartenders/waitstaff are educated about the drink menu. The guacamole comes in a very small portion but it was quite good (I found the chips to be greasy though). The tacos were tasty.. perhaps not as authentic as el charro or maize but decently priced at $3 for what you get (quite a filling portion and the taco was piled with lots of extras, including roasted pineapple and chile de arbol salsa--yum!).

My friend had been talking this place up saying it's totally disgusting but totally awesome (and right she was). She insisted we had to go AFTER the bars because I would probably want to murder her if we went sober. So we hit them up at about 2 or 3 in the morning; it was totally packed!I really don't know what I ate, because I just asked them for something without any meat so they hooked me up. Nothing on their menu is meat-free, so you just have to ask when you go in! It had french fries, mac n cheese bites, jalapeno poppers, and mozzarella sticks on a nice french bun. A culinary delight worthy of a michelin star, clearly. It was fun to eat once, I was clearly intoxicated when I ate it which made it even more fun, the staff were really happy to oblige our drunk selves with conversation while they made everyone's sandwiches. Everyone's drunk and passed out all over the place so the place is jam packed with college kids sleeping while their friend waits for their food. I don't think I would dine in at this place. Drunk people aren't clean people, and as such it's kind of icky on the inside because I'm sure the staff just can't keep up with everything. Oh, and no bathroom after 10 pm for anyone. Why? Because idiots ruined bathroom privileges for everyone by gettin' it awwwwwn in the bathroom. Kind of a huge downside when it takes 20 minutes or so to order and get your food.Will I be back? Probably not. Will I crave this sandwich again? Definitely not. Will I tell everyone I know about how disgustingly awesome this place is? Absolutely.",

Then name the sandwich after something that reminds you of a party school with serious collegiate sports teams, i.e. one sandwich is called the \"Fat Tailgate.\"I had said \"Fat Tailgate\" and yes, finished it all - every morsel of cheeseburger, mini corn dogs, ketchup and mustard - yes, while completely conscious at 2 pm. I had a gut trophy afterwards. It was beautiful. I also didn't want to eat for another two days.If you're particularly bold and want to impress me, I dare you to try their food challenge, the Big Fat Ugly.

Apparently if you eat this under 15 minutes, it's free.As for ambiance, it's typical for a grease spoon except that you can buy t-shirts.

The prices may seem a bit high at first, HOWEVER, they don't accept tip and it is sort of self-served (they will bring out the food to you though). I love how they have real authentic Chinese food with varying regional styles. This particular visit, we ordered their specialty tofu dish with soy sauce and scallions, a pork soup, drunken shrimp, and fried rice. LOVED the flavors although they were a bit salty for my taste, but some rice takes care of that. The tofu was crisped perfectly and the soy sauce is thick and filled with aromatic flavors from the garlic and scallions. The pork soup was nice, it is Taiwanese style and authentic. Haven't been able to find that soup elsewhere in the states yet. The drunken shrimp was spot on with the cooking wine and herbs. The shrimp meat was fresh as well! However, I recommend to skip the fried rice here, nothing really special whatsoever.Probably will drop by this place every time I visit the area. Give it a try!",

You write your order on the pad yourself, so you can take as long as you want (which could be a while, given the enormous selection). You also seat yourself and pour your own water, but you don't have to clean up afterwards. One note about tipping: unlike some restaurants that claim to not accept tips but then add an automatic 18% gratuity to all orders (not just parties with 6+ people), this place actually practices the real meaning of no tipping. As in, if you order something from the menu that's $20, you only pay $22 (after tax). This is how it should be - \"forced tipping\" is not \"no tipping\".I have only been here once, so I've only tried two of the dishes out of the 1300 or so on their giant wall mural of a menu (only for those who can read Chinese).

I have never been disappointed with any of their dishes. Here are some of my favorites:// Crispy tofu - must try. I think its amazing and light. My one Chinese friend informed me that this was NOT the best he has ever had but I don't believe him. // Szechwan beef - This might be my favorite dish. The meat is so tender, you would never believe it came from a Chinese restaurant. Ha!// Sesame ball - these are stuffed with red bean paste. I can't tell if they are a dessert or an appetizer. Either way it is delicious// Hot and Sour soup & Egg drop Soup - the MSG is to die for... haha I think i like the Egg drop soup a little more. The consistency is soo perfect.

Since I will probably never visit here again, I also ordered a small portion of the Taiwanese Salt and Pepper Chicken. It wasn't as good as the tofu, but certainly flavorful. I was already full from the large portion of tofu, so that may have affected my judgement. \u00a0The staff was very pleasant and helped me order even though I didn't follow the simple directions posted at the door. \u00a0If this is authentic Chinese food, I am a big fan!The Jasmine tea was free and lovely. The amount of food for $20 could have fed two hungry adults.UPDATE: After dinner I got very sick to my stomach... \u00a0I'm not sure if it was MSG or something else in the food. \u00a0Although the crispy tofu tasted very good, I'm downgrading to four stars based on the lasting after effects and the mediocre Salt and Pepper Chicken.",

They have a large menu in red paper on the wall and then printed menus in English to order from. I was impressed by the number of vegetarian items on the menu--more than I usually see at most Chinese restaurants. I got a small order of the Crispy Tofu since that menu item was highlighted on Yelp. Unfortunately, even though the small was $7, it was seriously barely any food. We are talking appetizer size portion. I definitely should of asked about portion size before ordering, but I am used to Chinese menu items that are not dim sum to have large portions. So while my crispy tofu was tasty, I'm still friggin hungry! Aside from the small portion size of my crispy tofu, the building was not heated sufficiently so I was not comfortably warm eating at my table (it's freezing outside today).Summary: not super impressed with the small portion sizes and the underheated dining room during the winter months.",

It's not all over cooked and doused in soy sauce like many asian food places have. The rice is still moist and soft, and the eggs are cooked fresh. Also, the meat still has some juicyness to it. AWESOME.Rangoons: These only have cheese in them. I wish they had crab.

While Chicago is certainly not known for having the best gathering of Chinese food in the country, we certainly made do with some wonderful meals. The short of it: going to Golden Harbor makes me feel like I'm back in the city. I absolutely loved the food. I loved it so much that I'm currently laying on the couch because I can't move. It's good stuff, Maynard. I scoured the reviews and we ordered most of what others liked: crispy tofu (good, but I probably wouldn't order it again); crispy chicken basil (amazing with just the right amount of kick!); salt and pepper prawns (OMG salt and pepper anything, really, but these were great and had some kick, too); 1/2 Peking duck (okay, they give you tortillas instead of pancakes which kind of sucked but the hoisin and scallions were great and the duck - OMG - the duck! so moist and perfectly fried); Chinese pork fried rice (decent, I suppose, but didn't have a ton of flavor without soy sauce -- but, to be fair, I'm not a huge fried rice lover); steamed BBQ buns (always good, of course); and my brother got the general tso's chicken (not normally a fan of this dish because I think it's too sweet, but this version was less sweet and I really liked it). \u00a0Sophie at the front was maybe the most adorable girl ever and so helpful. :] She even threw in a thing of sesame balls that were incredible. So unique tasting and their sweetness was surprising. The menu is overwhelming and the seating is chaotic. I'm glad we took our food home with us to enjoy. I get panicky in places such as this sometimes, and I certainly couldn't have picked what to eat without the help of the yelp reviews; the menu is like 20 pages long and an anxiety sufferer's worst nightmare. This is what keeps me from giving it a full five stars. Next time I'm in chambana visiting my brother, I will certainly go back. Bravo, GH. Thank you for restoring my faith in Chinese cuisine.",

You get a table # and look for your table # on arrival and use it to place your order. With each order, you get a big bowl of rice (based on the number of diners), plates, fortune cookies, and chopsticks. I think the prices may have gone up over the years, but I guess certain items are harder to come by in Champaign. The overwhelming Chinese menu on the wall is supposedly fully translated into English (look for the menus on the lefthand side). I'm not sure how complete the translated menu is.

They cater to all different styles of Chinese food.PROs- They have a thoroughly comprehensive menu. Whatever you can think of in terms of Chinese food, they can make it.- The lady behind the counter is AWESOME at catering to what you want. If you describe it in half mandarin / half English or even pure English, she can tell you what you're looking for. If you're looking for a suggestion of what to eat, she can list off a bunch of dishes and ask you if you like it spicy / non-spicy or a certain style.CONs- You have to clean up your own dishes. It's a place where they are so busy they just don't have time to do it. If you don't enjoy doing this aspect of it, there are lots of other places around town that will do it for you.- The wait can be a long time. If you go during peak hours which is basically the major meal times on weekends, you can expect to wait from 30 minutes to an hour just to order your food and then an additional half hour to get your food. They only have a couple of chefs so it takes awhile to get your food, but it's usually delicious.- Again, you're going to pay $$ for it and you're not going to fill up completely until you spend about $10-15 per person.- The atmosphere is noisy so it's not exactly a great place to go for a quiet date.I typically order:- Crispy Tofu - a soft tofu on the inside but crunchy on the outside that comes with a garlic sauce and green onions on top.- The fish fillets with garlic sauce - just as it's described, most people that like seafood like this.- Three cups Chicken - if you ask for it extra spicy and like spicy stuff, people generally like it.The food quality goes beyond any measure of any local Chinese restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area making this place WELL worth it if you're looking for chinese food in the area.",

        "review": "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!This is one of the most authentic Chinese restaurants I have ever been to in the United States. They have 3 versions of menus here: an American menu, a translated authentic Chinese menu, and a menu in full Chinese written on the wall. Though I could be wrong, I could not find all the items listed in Chinese on the wall in the translated Chinese menu. Your best bet is to bring someone with you who reads characters if you are looking to get the full experience. I got the following:sesame balls: These were not as large as I hoped though they arrived at my table hot and crunchy and the red bean paste oozed out in exactly the way I hoped.Crispy tofu: these are large chunks of soft tofu which have been breaded and friend with a slightly sweet sauce on top. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Very nice.Spicy basil chicken: this seems to me a variant of orange chicken in that it is similarly fried and smothered in sticky sauce. A little too American for my taste though it seemed to have great reviews here on Yelp.The best thing I ate: a whole spicy fish. This was one of the items that I couldn't find in the translated menu but was on the wall. I think it was number 2099 though a double check with the cashier wouldn't hurt. This fish was deep fried and covered in a spicy soy sauce based sauce that included hot chilis. The frying left the small bones of the fish completely edible and slightly crunchy and paired with the tenderness of the fish meat in the middle....*drrroooollllllsssssssss*Finally, most things are DIY such as ordering at the cashier and grabbing your own chopsticks and napkins as well as filling up your own tea kettle. The busboys are ever-present and eager to help should you have any misshap you can't handle (my brother spilled a cup of water and they cleaned that up like lightening). \u00a0And just like in China, tip is not expected here. They just charge $0.50/person to clean the tables.I am ecstatic that I ate here and cannot wait to come back again!",

There is a .50 cent charge per person for cleanup fee but no tip is necessary. They give you a number and eventually bring the food out to your table. There is self serve tea in the corner. There are a lot of options for food. We had 7 people - ordered 7 dishes: Sigua, On-Choy, lamb dish, beef+on choy, crispy tofu, fish filet, spicy beef+bamboo Everything came out hot and flavorful.

I was determined to try a non-Americanized chinese dish, so I went through all of the pictures and descriptions on Yelp. I asked the person taking orders to explain the difference between a couple of dishes and make a recommendation. She was very patient and thorough, and her explanations were easy to understand and decipher. \u00a0Due to raving reviews I read about crispy tofu, that was what I went with. I got the dish to go- It was a Tuesday night and I waited about 15 minutes for the food to come out. I don't mind waiting- must really be cooked to order! My only regret is that I didn't get it to go. The tofu had been sitting in a puddle of sauce in a container (as opposed to a shallow pool of sauce on a plate) that it lost is crispyness. The sauce, which is rather sweet, was a little too sweet for me to enjoy it as a main dish. I would have loved to have gotten a smaller portion of it as an appetizer.All in all, I'm excited to go back to Champaign and try another dish next time.By the way, portions are HUGE.

The only way I could barely eat half of what I ordered was by drowning it in Eel Sauce I had in my refrigerator.Maybe this is my fault from ordering from the translated menu?

The beef chao fan and soup noodles were just okay. Chao fan was over sauced and on the salty side. The soup noodles were too soft and the broth was bland. Soy sauce eggs were alright as well- surrounding meat and sauce was very salty, and eggs themselves needed more flavor. The crispy tofu was delicious as always- love this dish, and order it every time. I highly recommend it! The white boiled fish sounds better in chinese, but the dish itself was excellent.

        "review": "While Golden Harbor lacks the atmosphere and service of many \"fine dining\" restaurants in town, it compensates with over 100 different dishes brimming in flavorful sauces and expertly prepared meats, vegetables, and other Chinese specialties. \u00a0The restaurant serves everything from popularized American dishes (e.g., General Tso's chicken, fried rice) to more \"exotic,\" authentic cuisine (e.g., frog legs, \"stinky\" tofu).Of the items I've tried so far, I've really enjoyed the (legendary) crispy tofu and crispy beef in pepper sauce. \u00a0The dumplings were a little disappointing as they seemed like a standard pre-made frozen product rather than something made in-store (though honestly, I think most Asian places in town serve pre-made dumplings). \u00a0Unfortunately, they also seem to run out of leafy vegetables fairly often, so consider yourself lucky if you have the opportunity to sample the traditional Chinese vegetables. The woman who usually works the register speaks English very well and can be helpful if you are overwhelmed by the menu options. \u00a0Even though the menu is translated into English, the names of dishes are not always very descriptive (\"What's the difference between spicy chicken and chicken in hot sauce?\"), so you can just ask her for advice.For vegetarians, there is a clearly marked section of veg-friendly dishes on the back of the English menu. \u00a0This guarantees that your Chinese dinner will be free of chicken broth or other cleverly-masked animal products. \u00a0However, given the limited number of items listed in this section, I would also encourage vegetarians to browse the rest of the menu. \u00a0For whatever reason, there are veg-friendly dishes (marked with a cute cabbage icon) in the regular menu that are not included in the vegetarian section.The only disadvantage of Golden Harbor is that it does not yet offer a take-out or online version of their menu. \u00a0While they still allow customers to pick up food to go, you will probably have to place your order in-person at the restaurant, or already know what you want if you plan to call in advance.",

But I had no idea that I would be standing in front of the wall for so long - the menu is super extensive. The funny thing is when I mentioned that they have an \"egg\" section and a claypot section - my friends didn't even know! They have an interesting operation where customers order by the number on a slip of paper and then you pay for it at the counter. They charge 50 cents for clearing the table. And you grab all the utensils, bowls, tea, cups by yourself. We ordered the fried tofu, because that's one of the few dishes that my friends always get. However, I thought it was just okay. I prefer crispy fried tofu, not mushy fried tofu. We tried the salted fish with chicken claypot rice and that was pretty legit. The pork bun from the Taiwanese section was good too. They serve the buns and the meat separately so you make your own sandwich. The pork chop udon was a little disappointing, the pork chop looked super dry. They also have a dim sum section and we got the liquid-y yellow bun aka \"lau sa bao\" in Cantonese. That's a popular dim sum in Hong Kong and it's special because the steamed bun has liquidy yellow egg custard oozing out when you bite into it. However, the egg custard at this place wasn't too liquid-y so it was more like \"lai wong bao\". We got some simple green veggies to balance everything else out. My friends warned me to drink lots of water due to the amount of MSG in the food and boy, were they not kidding. It's still good though. It sure beats ordering from the English menu :)",

They used to be on campus, them moved out to Mahomet, now back on campus (note that the restaurant has changed names with each move). My friends and I always joke that they would make bank if they moved up to the Chicago suburb area. But they do very well already right now where they are. My family has known their family for about 6 years now, and they are the sweetest people on earth. If you're not sure what to order, you can always ask them (Tina is very helpful) what they recommend. Our staple dishes here are:Steamed fish (i don't know the name, but it's some type of white fish steamed with green onions, ginger, sitting on top of bean sprouts. So fresh and delicious!)Crab Rangoon - never had betterOrange ChickenBasil Eggplantsoup of some kind, they're all pretty goodsmoked chicken Crispy Tofu!!! People try to copy their recipe, but the original is still, after all these years, unbeatable!Service in my opinion is always great. If you're going to gripe about cleaning your own table or writing down your order on a piece of paper (it just makes the ordering and cooking process faster - win for everyone), then don't eat here. More good food for the rest of us who don't need to be sucked up to and waited on for a good meal. This is your cozy mom and pop and daughter Chinese food shop.

Pro Tip: \u00a0Go with a large party and share your platters. \u00a0Even the small size meals are enough to feed two people heartily. \u00a0It's a ton of fun though to just have everyone order different stuff, and pick a little bit of everything!",

A friend recommended Golden Harbor as the place to go and thus we went. Honestly, it's not your traditional Chinese restaurant. In fact, I would call it a cafeteria where they bring your food to you. You don't really see a server except when the food comes. You clear your own table or you pay them to do it. It's kind of absurd how it's all organized.At the same time, it's Chinese food I would eat more than once a year. I actually liked it and since Golden Harbor didn't really score any points for ambiance or any of that cute stuff, it's four stars on the basis of food alone. In addition, when the rice cooker crapped out, the manager apologized for the inconvenience and hooked us up with lo mein instead. It's a little more expensive and a little more complicated to order but I would say the food is more than worth it.",

The crispy tofu is also excellent, and is served with a sweet sauce and cilantro leaves. \u00a0I'd say it is the best in town. \u00a0The yellow bean fish is pretty consistently good, as well. \u00a0The food has always been good. \u00a0The prices are higher than what you see at a lot of Chinese places, but you get a lot of food and it is very good quality. \u00a0You get a big bowl of rice to eat with your food, too. \u00a0Generally, my girlfriend and I get a couple meals out of a visit here, where we get two entrees and usually pay about $30. \u00a0The dining room definitely does fill up, especially during the school year. \u00a0I'd give yourself some extra time to eat here, especially at dinner.I guess the ordering system confused some people to start with, but I don't mind it. \u00a0They recently streamlined it, too, along with improving the previously kind of Spartan decor. \u00a0You just write down the number of people in your party and what meals you want, pay, \u00a0and then they bring it to you. \u00a0Simple and easy. \u00a0You do have to clean up your own dishes (unless you want to pay a little extra) but they don't take tips, so it kind of balances out.This place has pretty much become my first stop for a Chinese-type food craving. \u00a0They're friendly, the options are immense, and the food is very good. \u00a0I was able to take my sister's vegetarian boyfriend here no problem, and the large sizes mean you can feed more people more affordably than if you're just going by yourself or with a date.Highly recommended!",

(Previous post was to confirm the restaurant is indeed Tina's which was in question before she actually opened.)Tina's new place is at the site of the old Pickles restaurant on Green St. \u00a0She thankfully gutted most of the restaurant (needed it ages ago) and it is now very open. \u00a0There are numerous tables for Chinese Family-Style eating (lazy-susan in the middle of the table for food) along with standard tables (4-seaters). \u00a0So, this is a larger restaurant by Tina's standards (larger than Mandarin Wok's total seating). \u00a0She has Tea-Pots for tables now and a large tea making machine. \u00a0A great addition to the restaurant. \u00a0There's now enough space for the chinese menu out front and also the buffet table (only used during moon festival I think).Unfortunately I removed one star from the 5 for two things which together I felt were slightly important to new visitors...(- half-star) The new system of computer ordering from front to back of house is a bit frustrating for old customers of the Woks. \u00a0You are presented with a pad of paper and a pen and instructed to place your table number and number of party on the pad. \u00a0You then write down the numbers of items you wish to order. \u00a0When you get to the front all of this goes into the computer and zipped back to the cooks by electrical magic. \u00a0This is significantly faster than the older method of ordering, but much less personable. \u00a0One of the golden linings of Tina's restaurants is actually Tina herself- she knows her menu and she wields it well. \u00a0So, if you aren't sure what to order, you're in a bit of a bind with the new system. \u00a0Now, this was the first week, so it all might calm down in a week or two. \u00a0Incidentally some of the items on the menu are actually mistranslated.The items we had (and love) are:#204 - Spicy Basil Chicken \u00a0(mislabeled on the menu)#851 - Garlic Stir Fried Green BeansThe final half-star off is for a slight difference in flavor in the #204- I don't know what it is, hard to put my finger on it- I think it's due to new equipment, but it's ever so slightly different (at least when I had it).I'm definitely tempted to to give Tina 5 stars, as I can't express how happy I am I can eat her food again, but I feel for those who are going to go to her new place for the first time, those two aspects may make a difference.I hope to be back with more numbers to add to the list of dishes we really love. \u00a0I'll reconsider the last star as we go more often. \u00a0I suspect the first week will always be a bit rough around the edges.Definitely a place to recommend to everyone interested in Taiwanese food.[Addendum- we came for dinner the night before, but had to leave as there were no tables to be had and a 1 hour wait for food. \u00a0We came back the next day for lunch, and it was much better.]",

Ice water and hot tea is free and self serve. Bowls of rice are free as well.The crispy basil chicken was okay, nothing particularly special. The crispy tofu did not arrive as hot and crispy as I had anticipated, but it was still tasty. The spicy whole fish is where it's at (no. 2099). Very flavorful and crispy to the point that some of the smaller bones are easy to chew up and eat (REALLY TASTY). The whole family kept going for the fish, and it was the first thing to go. Sesame balls were good too.The staff are very kind and helpful, it was a pleasure to interact with them. There is no typical tip, but instead, you pay a 50 cent per person clean up fee.

Golden Harbor even has signs saying tips aren't required and instead charge a $.50 per person clean up fee. \u00a0I also like how they give a five percent discount if you pay cash and the cashier was completely fluent in English and was far friendlier than any other Cashier/waitress I've experienced at a Chinese restaurant in town.The food was on par with what I've had at Lao Sze Schuan in Chicago's Chinatown, and far superior to any Chinese place I've found in town where every dish was basically - meat, veg, rice, generic greasy sauce,/no flavor.\" This is definitely a place for someone who appreciates good Chinese food, but isn't necessarily concerned with the ambiance or service.",

We ordered 6 entrees for 8 people, but I think we could have finished a 7th entree if we had it.My favorite things that we ordered were the fried basil chicken, the crispy tofu, and the pork buns. The basil chicken was nicely spicy and the texture of the breaded meat was wonderful. The crispy tofu was in a sweet sort of sauce that I really enjoyed. We assembled the pork buns ourselves because they were served as a plate of meat, a container of buns, and a plate of garnishes (crushed peanuts, some sort of veggies, and cilantro). The menu is very extensive, so be prepared to spend some time looking through it (though you really can't go wrong with the basil chicken or crispy tofu!) When you arrive at the restaurant, you take a table number, menu, and ordering slip to a table of your choice. Then after you decide what you want, you bring your order slip up to the counter and pay. It works best for a group if everyone brings cash to split the cost because I'm not sure that they allow separate checks from one table. Then someone will bring your food to your table. Tea is free, and you can simply serve yourself. At the end of your meal you clear your own dishes, or else pay a few dollars to have them bus your table for you.",

To be clear, you go in the door, there are menus, the American and the translated. You take an order pad and a pen, write down the number of what you want, take it to the counter and pay. They give you a number then bring the food to your table. After you pay, there is a table with flatware for you to grab. They bring your plates, napkins, and chopsticks to the table for you. Simple and easy!The translated menu has SO many choices! I didn't know what to order so I went with the standard General's chicken and my hubby got the Schezwan chicken. We split the pork filled pot stickers. Everything was amazing, just amazing. Best Chinese food I have ever had.I think next time we go, I'd like to have my Chinese friend order for us. I think that'd be a lot more fun and I'd get to try more authentic foods since everyone has been raving about them. I think he'd choose a lot of different and tasty stuff besides the Americanized dishes. We got there a bit after 5.

I had heard about the complicated ordering system and the offering of strange meat items (goat? some kind of squid?).Well, I finally went last Tuesday... and WOW. Here's a breakdown of the trip:My friend made reservations for our group of six. Our table was ready right on time, and while it wasn't super crowded, it seems that making a reservation for a group of more than four is a good idea. We picked up our menus and a pad of receipt paper, and a friend grabbed tea and cups for all. The tea was fantastic. The menu, bewildering - in the best way something can be bewildering.There are SO MANY OPTIONS, and so many of them sound AWESOME. We ended up with six dishes, to be shared family style. I chose a crispy eggplant and basil dish, and Mr. Husband got some crispy pork. We also had another eggplant dish (I want to cry just thinking about it! SO much scrumptious eggplant!), a black vinegar pork, some kind of weird crab thing (I don't like eating things that look like spiders, so I didn't eat that), and, uh, something else fried. Our food was served surprisingly quickly, considering we ordered six things. It only took 10-15 minutes as I recall. (The conversation was amusing, though, so it may have taken slightly longer.)The eggplant dishes were like riding a dragon while eating cotton candy made from angel tears (awesome). I loved loved loved the crispy fried eggplant! I surprised myself, too, in that my second-favorite dish was black vinegar pork. Mmm. I tried everything except the spiders, and I was in heaven. Prices were decent. Expect to pay around $10-15 per person. Considering that they charge a table-clearing fee and there's no expectation to leave a tip, that's pretty decent. Consider going elsewhere - you might only spend $6-8 per person on an entree, but then you add a drink, and have to tip 20% at the end. The total trip cost me $25 for 2 dishes, which I was pleased with.Bottom line, for the \"tl;dr\" crowd: Awesome food, not too expensive, go with a group, make a reservation, drink tea, don't eat spider-crabs.",

Order it if you like fried rice - this fried rice is of better quality.There is a huge Chinese menu on the wall, but have no fear, they now have a large translated Chinese menu and a Americanized Chinese menu, both in English. This is not a place to go to expect the fake Americanized Oriental Chinese atmosphere with Chinese music playing in the background, but is a restaurant that actually serves authentic Chinese food.

The crispy orange chicken and the orange beef were very tasty. I really enjoyed the Taiwanese Salt n Pepper Crispy Chicken. We had one of the Hot Pots but I don't remember which but I wish I did because it was really good. I also tried the Crispy Cuttlefish with salt yolk which I was very surprised by how good it was, I though it would be too salty but it was quite tasty. The service is always pleasant and now that they have their system down the wait time is very reasonable. Each dish is large so it is best to go with a lot of people and that way you can share many dishes. Looking forward to the next time I get to go.",

My family decided to find a table d leave it up to me \u00a0to order. I ordered: crispy basil eggplant (amazing!!) perfect tempura texture coated with basil sauce! It was perfectly balanced and the cripyess of the eggplant made the dish! beef brisket and tendon mala pot (TO DIE FOR) - oh my gosh!!! Holy tendon!! The brisket and tendon absolutely \u00a0melts in your mouth! My aunt kept talking about how wonderful this dish was! Clams w/ black bean sauce - meh. Nothing special.. Get something different. pork belly with bokchoy( great but reminds me too much of Paksiw which is a Filipino dish) the pok belly was very soft ad tasty! Whole fish #500 - SO EFFING goooooooddd!!! The fish was well seasoned and tasty! The fillet melts in your mouth! Yum! I am vey happy with this experience! The only reason I'm giving it a four is because of the organization of the place.

I recommend ordering 2 dinner dishes for 3 people. That will be more than enough food. When eating here for dinner be sure to allow for 45 minutes for your food to come. Though, I went with a group for lunch and went at the beginning of the lunch hour and our food arrived within 20 minutes. Anyways I highly recommend this place.",

(Well.. not a billion but I still take 20 minutes to decide what I want to this day...and I've been to GH my fair share of times, and then some) \u00a0For some reason there are a lot of people that don't care for this way of running things and I have watched people literally walk in.. look around, you see it click in their head how things work as they read the signs, and walk out. WTH?! \u00a0It's not rocket science and its really a relief to have a place to go that isn't a cookie cutter restaurant like a lot of the chain garbage around here. \u00a0The lady behind the counter is super friendly and will help you through the process if you're confused. \u00a0She also will recommend something for you to try if you tell her what you're in the mood for. \u00a0If you want something done a little differently, no problem. \u00a0VERY accommodating!Anyway, you figure out what you want and write it on the pad and pay. \u00a0They give you a number and you find a table. \u00a0Hot tea and water are available to go grab while you wait (or soda for purchase) \u00a0AND this place is also a BYOB! awesome. \u00a0Depending on how busy they are they can take 10 minutes and some nights where its busy I've waited ~30 to get all our food.. which in comparison to other businesses on a busy night, is nothing. \u00a0Also sometimes the food comes out in strange orders (main dish before soup or apps) \u00a0but that also is no big deal, I would rather my food be fresh and hot (which it always is here) then have it come out cold due to course etiquette.Now for the food. \u00a0Everyone says the crispy tofu is amazing, which it is. \u00a0But since that is a given I won't go into that. \u00a0My husband and I have tried to switch things up every time we go, but over time we've found some go-to dishes. \u00a0I really enjoy all the \"crispy\" dishes, the basil chicken is almost a candied texture and soooo yum! And they are super generous on the basil! Enough for every bite! There's also one in sweet chili sauce that I remember enjoying. \u00a0Also a sweet chili crispy pork (I'm drooling now). \u00a0The crispy beef with black bean is nothing like one of those cheap chain beef and black beans. \u00a0Its huge chunks of meat that are cooked until just perfectly done and have the best meaty taste unlike allot of places where you question what the meat is you are actually eating and what they've done to it to make it the disgusting flavorless texture it is. \u00a0This stuff is a great combination of flavor and they don't use the sauce to mask the meat. \u00a0We also enjoy the \"salt and pepper\" items, The salt and pepper squid is great, simple and done perfectly(there is no sauce) though I would ask them to go light on the salt as it is sometimes a little overpowering (but I love salt) The one thing my husband always goes back to is the crispy shredded pork in hot oil sauce, and I've got to say, it's pretty darn amazing as well. (am I getting repetitive yet with the \"amazing/awesome\" comments, at least you're getting my point this place is friggen great!) \u00a0So this pork is little crispy golden tidbits with lots of cilantro and hot peppers and its coated in this indescribable sauce, I'm sure it's simple.. but simple is good! \u00a0And this is one thing you have to try! \u00a0Never disappoints! \u00a0My 3 year old daughter likes the egg drop soup and the vegetarian egg rolls, which I've tried nibbles of and also find enjoyable. \u00a0The soup is thick and filling and not neon orangey yellow, you know its homemade. \u00a0The veggie rolls are crisp and light. \u00a0Even the rice is delightful! \u00a0You can have fried or white (we tend to ask for both) \u00a0And if you need more, just bring up your bowl and they will give you more!I could go on forever about this place, you can't go wrong, be adventurous! \u00a0Close your eyes and run your finger down the menu, where ever you stop, you'll love it!",

Frankly, the prices are so good I don't mind paying an extra buck. \u00a0So this restaurant is ideal for me: \u00a0great food, no frills on the setting or service, and lower prices. \u00a0If they had full waiter service, there would be longer waits for tables, and the prices would have to be much higher. \u00a0I'd rather save the money and eat there more often!",

Ever.I'm a big fan of chinese food and when I have my cravings, I usually have to settle for places that have limited vegetarian options and greasy stir fry that tastes suspiciously like it has duck sauce or oyster sauce. Not Golden Harbor though. The vegetarian menu option runs in pages. Literally. Well, first off, there are two menus to choose from- one is the American menu and the other is the Chinese menu. Both have lots of options in tofu, eggplant and vegetables. There is a super friendly and a sweet lady (who is also the owner) up in the front who processess your orders and you can ask her any question about the dish, she will take her time to explain it to you and what it has. She also makes sure that the kitchen caters to your vegan/vegetarian needs. Once the kitchen messed up our order and we got all meat stuff. When we went back to tell her that it was not what we ordered, she was so apologetic, threw in an order of steamed vegetable dumplings for free and personally made sure that we got our right order this time. Making good food is one thing but being so customer friendly and personal for a popular restaurant is another. Having been to many popular restaurants, with bad service and arrogant owners, I will easily give this place 5 starts and more. My personal recommendation- steamed vegetable dumplings. There are 8 pieces in total and make excellent starter. The outer coat is thin and less chewy (unlike other places where the outer shell is so chewy and thick)If you are a vegetarian and in the C-U area, I would highly recommend this place.",

I think it's very misleading to have a restaurant bill itself as \"authentic Chinese cuisine\" then specialize in their Taiwanese dishes only. I had hoped their Chinese dishes would be good or passable at least, but their versions of Mongolian beef, Szechuan chicken, and chicken with black bean sauce were barely edible. I would give the Chinese food 2 stars and the Taiwanese food 4 stars (because the Crispy fried tofu was good) and average it all at 3 stars.Taiwanese dishes are heavy on soy sauce and sesame oil. \u00a0They can have a Malaysian influence. There are a lot of deep fried dishes. So if you prefer deep-fried food and brown sauces, as well as home-style or stewed meat, you might like this restaurant quite a bit. It's BYOB and bus your own table or pay a $1 fee, so good for feeding a large group family-style, by sharing dishes.Take a close look at the pictures that customers have attached of the food they ate here because that's what it really looks like. what wiki has to say about Taiwanese food:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta\u2026",

They do have a warm food counter, however, from what I noticed, they use a microwave to warm up the food which some don't like. Their warm food is ok but not something I would go out of my way to get. They've improved cleanliness throughout their shelves/isles which was a problem in the past especially when you take a product off of the shelves with a good amount of dust covering it. But again, that's all understandable assuming some products don't sell as frequently. I've questioned the warm food hygiene since it is located near the cash register and employees are often switching back and forth between handling cash and serving food. They've always used gloves or spatulas but those that have the knowledge are aware of reaching over uncovered food containers to rich a product placed closer to the front of the display and the fact that bacterial and etc, can easily come from an employee's skin/clothes/etc, while reaching over. The above are all justifiable based on their location/resources and other factors that limit their operations. What I don't understand is $10 minimum requirement to use Credit/Debit cards. I'm a frequent customer at this business and I look past all the faults that I stated above. However when I rush over during a few free minutes only to be turned down because of a purchase of less than $10 when I only have my debit card to pay with? That doesn't speak highly of the management/owners or the employees because what I spend at this business is well over the transaction charge. This is a small convenient store slightly larger than an average sized 7-Eleven and they sell many items that are less than the $10 requirement. Greedy? Maybe but regardless of the title any one of us chooses for their practices, the lack of competition in this area shouldn't give the owners a reason or excuse to have ignorant policies. $10 minimum? I would even let a $5 minimum slide but $10 is pushing it.Bottom line, take cash with you or don't walk in unless you're willing to spend more than $10 which I almost always do, except this one day. They may lack local competition but the internet is very close and I can most definitely purchase the same products for cheaper or the same, including the shipping charge. Not good business practices for a local business that depends on local clients.If you don't care about that, then more power to you and enjoy your shopping experience.",

My favorite night was Tuesday nights - Ride the Rail, and yes I completed my rail card senior year. I've got my name up on the wall which is very cool but I've got so many great memories of sitting around having beers with friends. And, I have to say, the beer selection's pretty good actually. They always have a few good drafts on top of the normal college bar cheap, watered down stuff. Nothing elaborate, but good quality mass produced stuff - Sam Adams Seasonals, Woodchuck, etc.The food's surprisingly good as well. I would say Firehaus has better food, but as far as green street bars go, that's probably it. I generally stuck with burgers or chicken sandwiches and they have a good selection of toppings to put on whatever food you get.But you really go to Legends for the atmosphere. It's an upperclassman bar where you can go to actually hang out and talk with friends. They have good music playing in the background but it's never all that loud and it's stuff you want to listen to anyway.

How else can we play \"In the Air Tonight\" to kill the mood at 1am?

It doesn't really matter for the management because the demand they have is abusrd, but it us upsetting.

It's not uncommon to see the line backed up, wrapping around some of the tables, because of one or two orders that seemed to have thrown off the staff. If you are the type to plan ahead, order online, so you can just walk up to the pick up register and get your food almost immediately. It is also quite common to have to repeat yourself when ordering; this is largely due to the noise level inside during lunch and dinner hours.Chipotle has burritos, bowls, salads, and tacos (and more on a secret menu). Just about everyone gets a burrito or a bowl and you're likely to get more for your money with those two. It's easy for a burrito to get over packed if you're the type to get everything on it, so you might want to opt for a bowl instead. The chicken is arguably the best meat option here. The steak is chewy, the barbacoa is boring, and the carnitas are dry and under spiced. A pork travesty. Veggies (green peppers and onions) are free, but they won't ask if you want it, you'll have to be explicit.Note that the food here is not true mexican, but very Americanized.Chips, salsa, and guac here are all good. Note that if you want guac on your burrito or bowl, it costs extra.They don't have Dr. Pepper in the soda fountain. :(What I've said so far might not seem deserving of a 4 star rating, but the reason this place is 4 stars is because of the price. A little less than $7 bucks gets you a HUGE amount of food.",

Niman Ranch pork is ten times more juicy and delectable than the factory farmed version. It's also much more humanely raised and ecologically friendly. Chipotle braises the pork with pepper and other mild spices and the tender and flavorful result is what keeps me coming back all the time. There are lots of other options ranging from chicken to vegetarian, but in my opinion the pork is really the best. This location sometimes will give you a discount if you order just meat/cheese/rice and sometimes not...it's rather bizarre, but I think it depends on if the manager is around or not. I keep my receipts as a rather amusing record of how many times I have gotten the \"Ilini secret special.\"It's quite expensive as \"fast food\" goes and it gets crowded.

They only serve burritos, salads and chips. They have chosen a narrow scope and do it well.Like most chain restaurants, it usually tastes better the when they are busier. I have gone at off-times and had less-than fresh ingredients served to me. Frankly though if they start scraping the bottom of the container of meat I imagine you could politely ask to wait for a fresh batch.I'm not a fan of grease and I enjoy the fact that the meat seems lean but juicy. That way grease isn't squirting all over your plate as you attempt to eat the burrito. Their chips are generally very fresh tasting and warm. They have just the right amount of salt. I'd recommend the guacamole as it's certainly better than I ever imagined it could be.There are better sit-down restaurants to eat Mexican in town.

So instead of delighting me with a smile and a quick resolution to this issue, the manager made a choice to verbally argue with me (after I had waited a good 5-10 minutes in line), and leave me displeased with both the food and especially the customer service.Chipotle, you're supposed to leave the customer relaxed, happy, and satisfied -- not upset.",

Coffee (also local) is memorable. I ordered the Guatemalan Torta: eggs, ham, black bean spread, and Monterey Jack cheese on Cuban Bread $9 and my brother had the Guatemalan breakfast: Two fried eggs with black bean sauce, sour cream, fried plantains and tortillas $9. Portions were large, fresh, and appetizing - the torta bread was soft and chewy = awesome; the other ingredients worked well together (ex. saltiness of the cheese + sweetness of the ham). Bonus: I was able to have half of it as leftover lunch today which tasted just as good and wished I had a cup of their coffee to accompany it. The Guatemalan breakfast is a version of the torta deconstructed and my brother's favorite part was the plantains.Operations/management aspect was a mess & unwelcoming. There was a sign that stated \"wait to be seated\" but that only works if you actually have someone seating people. After waiting for what seemed like an eternity a server appeared moving at snail pace. Coffee came in a cup the size of an airplane coffee cup because they ran out of regular mugs. No one stopped by after food came to the table to check how our food was or refill coffee. I was finally able to locate a server by the time I was close to being finished for a coffee refill, box, & check.

They screwed up our reservation, and we had to wait till 9:10 pm to be seated. The group ahead of us, who DIDN'T make a reservation, got a table before us. I asked if there's a point at all to make a reservation, and the owner stuttered. The owner then attempted to seat 5 of us at a small table meant for 4 at most which I thought was a little ridiculous. Being a server myself, I could've found a better spot ESPECIALLY when there's an empty 2-person table that could easily be joined to my table. FYI, the place was busy, but it was NOT packed since it's 8:30 pm on a Sunday night. The also had a special graduation menu which is almost identical to the regular menu but pricier. Food was good, but not great. We got 2 appetizers and 5 dishes, and we all sampled each other's. I liked the duck and the tilapia entree the most.

I thought immediately: is this Champaign or Chicago ?! The food was ok, I agree 100% with a previous review saying the seafood paella was not a paella- this is correct. It's more of a risotto with seafood on top, which was not seasoned that much to be honest. It was decent, but it was not paella. I had the calamari for an appetizer and it was good, although the way it was prepared was reminiscent of fish sticks. I had the Escobar's Punch as a cocktail and it was good.I would definitely come back, I liked the atmosphere/ambiance.

The place was recommended to me by a friend as being one of the better restaurants in Champaign, and the menu online looked interesting, so I decided to give it a try for dinner. The restaurant is really big and was pretty empty when I went (around 8pm on a Tuesday night). After pigging out on the complimentary bread and drinking a mango margarita (tasty if a bit too sweet maybe), I started with an appetizer of fried calamari. I should better than to order seafood in the middle of Illinois: it was certainly not terrible, but it wasn't great either... a letdown for the calamari lover that I am. I then ordered the duck breast: the duck itself was not very good (not very tender and slightly overcooked), and it came with steamed vegetables (boring), mashed sweet potatoes (not bad but a little plain), fried plantain chips (good), and roasted pears (definitely the highlight of the dish: these were actually quite delicious). Overall... not a terrible entree but still quite disappointing and a little overpriced. To their defense, the portions were very large and I was completely stuffed by the time I left the restaurant.

        "review": "Escobar's might be the best restaurant in Champaign. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. The wait staff has always been pleasant and attentive. And the food is almost always impressive. I'll acknowledge other reviewers who gripe about the time it can take to receive your food. Going to a fine restaurant should be an event, not something you rush through. It's an experience. I've never found a meal here to take longer than similar fine restaurants. A typical meal at Escobar's might last roughly 70 - 90 minutes if you get an appetizer, entree and dessert. Not unreasonable at all, but maybe a little longer than a meal at Chili's, for instance. ;-)As for the food, you'll be served a small basket of assorted breads once seated. These are always fresh, delicious and unique. Some sweet, some savory. I never know what kinds we'll get, and I always get a little bit excited to see what will be in there. Please excuse my nerdiness. Below is a rundown of some of the dishes I've had at Escobar's. Appetizers: Coconut crusted shrimp - fantastic. The shrimp are enormous and perfectly fried. Served with a delicious orange-jalapeno dipping sauce.Duck confit taquitos - a taste sensation, but at $10 for just 2 taquitos, it's a bit of a splurge. Almost an amuse-bouche than a true appetizer. If there were 4 in an order, getting this would be a no-brainer every time. House made guacamole - a huge portion of freshly-made guacamole, served with a heaping pile of warm, roasted tortilla chips. This is a favorite when I come here. Entrees:Filet mignon and andouille sausage kebobs - my new favorite dish. I have never had such tender, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon in my life. The andouille sausage was a nice, spicy accompaniment. Huge portion. Absolutely delicious. Phyllo wrapped lamb loin - a bit overrated. The phyllo was a little burnt when I ordered this, and there wasn't much of a sauce. Crab cakes with guajillo cream sauce - O.M.G. The crab cakes are light, flaky, fresh, and this guajillo cream sauce - a bright orange sauce, takes this dish to a whole new level. Spicy, smokey - it's a heaping forkful of warm love going in your mouth every few seconds. Love. Sauteed shrimp and scallops - a forgettable, bland dish - and the scallops were gritty (my worst nightmare whenever eating scallops). One of the few disappointments I had when dining here. They do have a small dessert menu. Mango rum cheesecake, lemon curd pie with berries, flan (I never knew I liked flan until I tried it here!). Dessert portions aren't too big, nor too small. The perfect way to end a fantastic meal. Again, service has always been friendly and attentive. Once, we were not waited on for about 10 minutes after being seated. When our waitress realized her mistake, she offered us free soup to make up for it, and gave us excellent service during the rest of our meal. She went out of her way to make it up to us, and we appreciated her enthusiasm. One of my favorite restaurants in the C-U area!",

Usually we order wine or beer, but this time got our mixed drink on. She had a super strong sangria that was good once you had a couple of sips and I had a Capirinha (sp?), which tastes like a Mojito w/o the mint, but with tequilla instead of rum (I know its not tequilla, but that is what it tastes like). Anyway, that was really strong, too but was not as tasty as their spicy Bloody Maria that followed.Service was spotty for us. Our server probably should not have been assigned our table, as she was busy with a private party in a special room they have. She did not make it up to us in the al fresco dining section as much as I would have liked. However, she made up for it with a comp on the Bloody Maria, so its all good in this hood.The food was great. We had an app of their stuffed pupusas, a great vegetarian dish that is bready goodness just bursting with latin flavors. I had the enchiladas and she had the pork tenderloin. Both were fantastic and big enough for lunches the day after. Since we were on bikes, they were able to wrap the dishes up extra careful for my backpack, and they made the trip back to Urbana no worse for the wear.BTW- There was an obnoxious 40-something biatch next to us getting all nasty with her server about the (extremely moderate) amount of spice in the food. Its not too spicy. If you are think Escobar's is too spicy, then you will never know the joys you are depriving yourself.",

The duck taquitos were dry, like frozen ones that were microwaved a little too long. (And they still sold for around $10 for two taquitos.) And the seafood in the paella ($21) was overcooked, and in a sauce that tasted a lot like Chef Boyardee sauce.My colleagues enjoyed the fish filet dishes, though, so perhaps it may be best to just avoid the dishes mentioned above.Besides that, friendly service and a good beer selection.",

        "review": "Awesome. Actually, half of the owner team is Guatemalan. They also own Milo's in bufu, Urbana but as Escobar is the chef, Escobar's is his place.I always have a good time with their wine staff, especially the lovely salty gal that has only been tending a short while but swigs wine like a sailor, which is to say she doesn't take a dainty white-glove approach. She's a no-nonsense, straight-up pro that can take in a mouthful of wine and nail the flavor notes without all the swirling and sniffing and sloshing. It's the only time I've been able to say, \"this one tastes like a chewy, sweaty S&M jock strap\" and have someone know exactly what I mean without further explanation. And despite the fact that she's a beer girl, her vino recommendations (granted the list is not as extensive as other places downtown) are excellent.I've done a few different things on the menu but I always go back to their duck a l'orange. The meat is always cooked to succulent perfection and maybe it's because everything on the plate is a shade of orange but the entire dish tastes juicy, earthy, bright and warm. Like 6pm sunshine! Like it's made from Care Bears! I want to liquify it, put it in an IV and jack the whole tasty lot right into my veins!The mussels are excellent as well and my friend scarfed the ceviche on our last visit (I had my face in the mussels - so much for sharing).The bread is baked in house and they have a bombin' spicy corn focaccia so it's easy to load up on table bread guilt-free because you can't nosh on Escobar bread anywhere else but Escobar's.Most importantly I like this place because the food is so good and the staff is so nice that it doesn't need all the flash and glam of other restaurants to earn five stars on yelp! The closest comparison I have is the cluster of restaurants out in Napa: sun-drenched, family-owned, friendly and in an epic love affair with food. Outdoor seating means gazing into a parking lot as cars zoom by but it is still the only place in Champaign where I am a little saddened at the end of my meal because I don't have four stomachs, four wads of cash and four hours to sit and eat four more servings of Escobar's duck a l'orange.",

A basic principle of good resto services is to avoid gratuitous meanness, even during ebertfest. I'm a local, love their food and won't go back. People deserve to be treated with basic civility, esp when they are civil to you. The second waiter's apology later sounded a bit more genuine, but not enough. Goodbye Escobar's.

Tasty, but not the best I've ever had.Entrees: The seafood paella is not a paella; its a bunch of seafood in a pot, with rice and sauce buried at the bottom. It was a beautiful presentation, and the seafood was cooked well but woefully underseasoned. None of the sauce touched the seafood, and the sauce was sub-par at best. It's Latin American food, right? Seasoning?!The phylo-wrapped lamb is an inventive dish, and beautifully presented. I think their chef went to beauty school, not culinary school. Again, underseasoned and the glaze seemed to be missing something...salt probably. Drinks: The mango margarita tasted like it was laced with lighter fluid or nailpolish remover.

The ambience was nice and the food was delicious.Our wait staff was a little slow and it took them a while to come around to refill our water and our bread basket, but the entree and overall experience made up for it.I ordered their white sangria. I must tell you that if you like sweet and fruity drinks, definitely order it it. It was so good that my friends decided to order it as their second drink.For our food, we decided to start off with the Coconut-crusted shrimp with orange-jalape\u00f1o dipping sauce. It was pretty good. The best part was the sauce.My entree, I ordered the Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin filled with goat cheese, rosemary, and coriander, served with red-skin mashed potatoes and port reduction. It it a mouthful to say and I must say that it is worth every word. The lamb was cooked perfectly and all the sides were very complimentary.

It's nicely done but unpretentious. The wait staff was incredibly friendly. Refills were quick in coming and we got our food very quickly. As you waited you are served a basket of various tasty breads.We started with the coconut shrimp. It was absolutely delicious with huge, perfectly cooked shrimp covered in a tasty coating. The coating was very light and wasn't as sweet as some coconut shrimp can be (I think that was a plus) and it was served with a slightly spicy sauce and and a small bed of greens, onions and mango. The flavors were spot on. You only get four shrimp total but the shrimp are quite large and it was a good size portion for an appetizer.I had the chicken mol\u00e9 for my entree. Finally I have found a good mol\u00e9 in Champaign! I seriously had given up hope of finding a decent version of this sauce here, let alone an excellent version. I've tried just about ever mol\u00e9 sauce in town and it's almost universally bland with little more flavor than the sauce black beans are canned in. But this sauce had a great smokiness, a slight cinnamon undercurrent and the perfect amount of spice. It's served over two large pieces of chicken, still on the bone. The chicken was wonderfully cooked. The presentation was also a plus. It was served with Mexican rice, black beans, cooked fresh vegetables, \u00a0a fresh salsa and two large plantain chips all on a banana leaf-covered plate. The portion is nicely sized. Every element of this dish was superb. I really cannot find a fault with any of it and everything went so well together. The vegetables were even cut beautifully!My dining companion had the lamb dish and from the bite I had it was phenomenal as well. We finished off the night by sharing the chocolate-covered orange cake with raspberry cream. I would probably be a little afraid of how something like that might turn out if the meal I'd had wasn't so delicious. The desert did not disappoint.It's not a cheap place to eat dinner, although I took a look at their carry out lunch menu and they had some really great options all in the $10 - $11 range.

        "review": "Escobar's has a lot going for it: location, friendly service, a chef who is fearless and skilled. What it doesn't have going for it is timing. Spouse and I have been there several times, and each and every time, there has been a timing problem in the kitchen. We've had dinners come out two minutes after our appetizers (and then left to overcook and dry out under heat lamps when we sent them back so we could eat our first course BEFORE our main course.) We've had main courses come out for half the table, with the other half left to wait five + minutes for theirs. Any time we've been there that someone has asked for a deviation from the menu - the last time it was \"no potatoes or rice, please\" - the kitchen misses the deviation. Spouse and I have had many good meals there, although not great. For us (and I stress this may just be us, having read other reviews), the portions are WAY too large, and the dishes can sometimes be needlessly complicated. The lamb wrapped in phyllo with chevre fell apart so that it was impossible to experience the textures and flavors of the phyllo, lamb, chevre and sauce in the same bite (will say the phyllo and chevre together was really good.) Add in the rice that came with it (the one we tried not to get), and the overall dish was mostly just...starchy, which stepped all over the more subtle flavors of the lamb. Like another reviewer here, we liked the dish, but it was too heavy handed. Too much food and too many competing ingredients. While the kitchen timing issue is annoying, it's not our ultimate problem with Escobar's. Escobar's just doesn't \u00a0seem to trust how very much it has going for it already, so it keeps piling other stuff on, just in case. The result is a meal that always makes us feel slightly bludgeoned afterwards and we end up returning to other places over and over before venturing to Escobar's again.",

The chef poured the corn cream sauce on half of the talapia. A simple and wonderful idea that let us enjoy the dinner in different ways. The side vegetable mix was great too. Obviously cut and cooked right before the meal. The better half had a steak with a port reduction sauce. Same fresh vegetable mix. Note, I mentioned to the waitress I do not like peppers. Without asking she made sure there were none in my dinner vegetables. Good, thoughtful service. Wine menu was OK, but would not stop us from coming back. Easy parking. Outside seating.",

The calamari wasn't the traditional type you'd get at mainstream American restaurants but it was thicker pieces of squid with panko breading. This non-traditional set-up was quite good although the sauce that came with it could be a little bit more tangy. The Moroccan beef soup was very good, beefy but not overbearing. For the entrees, I ordered the Phyllo wrapped lamb and she the duck roast. The lamb was excellent, it came wrapped in a flaky Phyllo pastry and a succulent sauce. The sides were also superb, although I could use a little less garlic in the mashed potatoes. The duck was cooked to perfection, although the plantains and mashed sweet potatoes were left a lot to be desired.We shared dessert, which was the banana flambeed with vanilla bean ice cream. It was amazing, although it is quite hard to mess up something so innately satisfying. Overall, the presentation was superb and the waitress courteous. The atmosphere was fine for the occasion, although my girlfriend did complain about the \"orangy\" walls... haha. In any case, I highly recommend Escobar's for a good meal.",

Combine this with the word-of-mouth it gets around campus and my liking of Mexican food, it was a must try.I came in to order take-out on a Wednesday at 5pm. The place was pretty busy with lots of call in orders, pick-ups and even a few people eating in the small sitting area. It was bustling!I grabbed a menu and took nearly 5 minutes to decide what I wanted. I wanted to try a little bit of everything but still order what I usually would. I finally decided on the Torta Aghoada (asada) and a Taco Americano (pastor). The Torta Aghoada wasn't exactly what I was expecting and part due to my own ignorance. I thought for sure what I was getting was going to be flat with all the ingredients on top. Nope, my memories of high school Spanish deceived me and the torta is a sandwich. I got it confused with a tostada....d'oh! Regardless, I had never had anything like it even in the south suburbs of Chicago where I'm from (maybe I should have Mexican more often). The sandwich was piled with carne asada, beans, cheese, avocado spread, lettuce sour cream and spicy sauce. Unfortunately, the spicy sauce was very overwhelming and I wasn't able to embrace all the flavors of the torta, especially the avocado spread and the meat. In all fairness, I was warned that it was spicy, so I can't complain about it!I also ordered a pastor (pork) taco Americano. I guess the Americano taco comes with more than just a traditional Mexican taco, namely lettuce and maybe even cilantro or onions. This was surprisingly good. The pork had great flavor and didn't taste overly salty. The only thing this taco needed was sour cream!Also included with my take-out order was salsa and chips. I got 2 little cups of salsa and a small bag of chips, which was enough for me since I had ordered a pretty large amount of food, but may not be sufficient for a group of people. The chips were surprisingly good and didn't taste like they were out of a bag. The red salsa was too liquidy to eat just with the chips, but had great flavor. I enjoyed the spiciness and consistency of the darker salsa, but didn't like the taste as much. Either way, they were both decent.I really enjoyed my food from Maize. It's not the crappy Mexican you pay $1/taco for and its also not Rick Bayless expensive, but does sit very well towards the better side of those two and the portion size is very good (I was stuffed after eating everything). I will definitely be back in to try some of their other things. A fair warning though, the menu inside is a little different from the one online (maybe it changes?).",

Although they were soggy by the time I got home, the ingredients were so fresh and the flavor was perfect. Not too salty and rich in flavor. The prices are perfect a lot cheaper than Rick Bayless Xoco. I just wish it was easier to find parking or even space to eat in. You get chips and 2 types of salsa for free as well even if you are getting carry out. I was surprised I only got 1 bag even with four entrees. I will have to make sure I ask for more next time.

The service is fast when there isn't a long wait. The food is terrible. I ate here a few times last week and each time it was disappointing. The meat (steak) was flawed on many levels. It is a poor cut, not carne asada but something cheaper. The burrito here is small and there is very little meat to begin with. I also tried the tacos and they too were bland. The guacamole is alright and the sauces add some flavor. I am not sure why everyone thinks, writes highly of this place. The owner should do justice and actually use descent meat and not rubbish. You are not doing a service to anyone except your bank account. Sad. TBK would be put this place to shame.",

The ingredients of every entree are fantastically fresh, the food is very quickly served, and the service is fantastic. The menu is extremely simple to navigate, and the ladies who work the register are very kind and helpful. On most days, I eat the veggie burrito here, and I'm always elated to eat it. It's cheaper than Chipotle, and that much tastier!Do note that the restaurant is extremely small, so seating may be tough to find at peak hours, but it is 100% always worth the wait.I made it a point to go to this restaurant weekly instead of attending one of my lectures.

The place is small, so we tend to call in our order and show up to pick it up. When we've ordered on site, there was usually a line, but the wait was never too long and the food was always worth it. Our favorite item there is the fish tacos, but we also enjoy the chips and salsa. This is definitely the top Mexican place in my opinion and it is super affordable and tasty.",

I'm from New York, so I'm not exactly an expert on Mexican food, but everything I ever got at Maize was excellent--chalupas, gorditas, tacos, and burritos. (The chalupas especially... maybe I should fly back to Champaign for the weekend...) The people working were friendly and the service was prompt. Maize is, food-wise, one of the best places to eat in Champaign-Urbana.The only downside of this place is its tininess. There's room inside for about a dozen people sitting elbow to elbow. I always got takeout, and even standing around waiting for my order I always felt like I was in someone's way. The parking lot is proportionately small too, with only four or five spots, so you may not even be able to park at Maize to get takeout. (Fortunately it's within easy walking distance of campus, and the Green bus line goes right by so you might not have to drive.) If this restaurant were to expand and keep the same menu it would be fantastic.",

        "review": "My brother (Pat E., Elite Yelper, Pancake Lover) suggested we try Maize for lunch instead of our usual SUnday fare (eggs, pancakes). Our stomaches have been programmed to eat brunch style food on Sundays for as long as I remember. I'll be honest, I was a bit nervous going for Mexican, but it turned out to be a great choice!We arrived around 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was jam packed, which is not surprising because it's the size of a panic room. There's about 12-15 seats total in the place, and it's definitely crammed. They are actually in the process of opening up a sit down place in the area, and per one of the workers, it's in the final stages of opening. This was my bro's 2nd time here, so he took the lead. He ordered a ribeye taco, a fish taco, a hultihoche (corn smut) quesadilla, and a steak tlacoyo. The tlacoyo is bascially an open faced taco.I ordered a steak (carne asada taco), a chorizo taco, a pumpkin flower quesadilla, and a pork (pastor) tlacoyo. We both decided to ask for our sour cream on the side for our tlacoyos, because we like being in control, and we wanted to use the SC for other dishes.Only one word can describe my meal: A-MAIZE-ING (I'm sure I'm the first person to use this)!Our food came out promptly. Our drinks were always full, and everything was extremely flavorful, including the salsas that came with our chips (we each had a few).The tacos were topped with cilantro and onions. Quick note: Everything here is made with corn tortillas (get that white crap outta here!) Also, gluten free, if you swing that way. The carne asada was so good, and they didn't skimp on the portion size either! The chorizo was zesty but not spicy, which I preferred. I was expecting it to be sliced up like a sausage, but it was actually ground chorizo. Either way, the tacos were amazing! My only complaint.... too small! But for 2.25 a taco, a very fair price.The pastor tlacoyo was the first dish I actually dove into. Topped with cheese, I added my sour cream quite liberally anyways, and I did not regret it! The pork did not have as much flavor as the other meats, but that's not to say it was bad. Still very good!! I added the darker salsa to the tlacoyo, which may have masked the flavor of the pork, but I'm not sure. You have the option of grilled or fried for this dish, and I went with grilled.Finally, to the quesadilla, my favorite part of the meal. Filled with cheese and pumpkin flower, this was the best tasting dish for me. I also liked how the quesadilla came with lettuce and tomato, which can be placed on top or eaten by itself, which is what I did, along with the lighter salsa. At the end of the meal, I added sour cream to the top, which was amazing!All in all, our 8 dishes added up to 25 dollars. Very reasonable for the amount of food! If you decide to eat here, yes, it's cramped, but I thought it was a cool experience. I thought it was weird how a group of 3 adults came with a baby, and nestled up in the corner. Not really a great place for kids, let alone babies.There were plenty of to go orders being placed and picked up while we were there. They are very fast in the kitchen!Highly recommended! After my last mexican dining experience (Fernando's in Chicago), this was the polar opposite. Great food, service, prices, and memorable, for all the right reasons. I can't wait to head back for my next visit!",

The second time I went here I visited with my twin brother. Both trips were FANTASMIC (yep). It did open us up to hearing a conversation that two of the biggest nerds on Illinois campus were having. It was hilarious because while they were talking about geometry, machines, and other things nerds talk about they were swearing like sailors. So not scientific, bro! \"My flux compactor connected to the tangent...blah\". The second time I visited, I was treated to a conversation about Ernest Hemingway and \"Old Man and the Sea\". That was good. The lady who was talking about said author also mentioned how much she enjoyed Franklin BBQ in Austin, Texas. She was wearing one of those baby in front backpacks with a baby inside. Folks, in a restaurant this small, there is no point in having children. Get it to go!I was told that they will be opening up a sister restaurant in the old Cafe Luna location. It was hilarious because the cashier told me that this was the case and I acted like I knew EXACTLY where it was...which I do not! HEHE. It should be open by the end of 2013...they're just waiting on permits. It will also include appetizers and drinks...heck yeah, college!This place seems authentic; what I mean by authentic is not made from a package. MADE IN HOUSE! As a matter of fact, the grads and undergrads lining up out the door made me realize...THIS IS AUTHENTIC...and their prices are excellent! I ended up paying 10.32 for three items. The second time I went here I got an extra taco and it was a great choice!Among the simple menu, I decided to go with a fish taco, pumpkin flower quesadilla, and asada tlacoyo. All were fantastic! The workers were very nice and accommodated all my complicated questions (How do you say \"tlacoyo\" and it is all grilled, right?). I love how they have masa...corn based tortillas! So great! Get that white flour sh*t outta here! Those empty carbohydrates...I AIN'T GOT THAT KINDA TIME! My friends ordered some burritos, quesadillas, and some guacamole. IT WAS LIKE AVOCADO HEAVEN!I've also sampled the ribeye taco and the corn smut tortilla. All the items I've had here are fantasticThe mild AND hot salsas were excellent as well! I had to order mas (Spanish)I don't always eat Mexican in CU...but when I do...I do Maize. Simply amaizing. Pun entirely intended. I'd would order to go if I come again or just try their sit down (done by the end of the month).Based on the food (6), service (5), and restaurant experience (4), I have to give Maize a 5 star review. If this place was bigger, I would go every weekend. Actually, I might go every weekend anyway. It has a street food feel to it. This is one of my top CU area joints! Guy Fieri and Jimmy John (yes, that Jimmy John) have tried this place...which actually led me to find it. I highly recommend!",

They have a number of grilled or fried items from which to choose, as well as \u00a0a couple of good sides like guacamole. On each item, you can choose from the following meats: carne asada, chicken, chorizo, or pastor. My favorite is the flavorful pastor (marinated roast pork). Common co-toppings include a wonderful fresh, salty cheese, salsa fresca, sour cream, and cilantro. A variety of salsa comes with, and each bite of every item is delicious, with or without the salsa, which is very good. Tacos, burritos, tostadas, tortas, tlacoyos, challupas, quesadillas, gorditas, flautas, and huarches are all available. Honestly, they are variations on a theme, rather than distinctively different. Choose your texture. I'm an especially big fan of the tlacoyos (stuff served on top of a piece of grilled chewy flat bread -- you can get the bread fried, but grilled is better). Some of the items do offer interesting add-ons. For example, you can add pumpkin flowers or or mushrooms to the quesadillas.Maize is located in a small converted space, with just a few seats around the main counter and a counter that runs immediately behind along the back wall. Seats are counter stools. At busy times, customers who are waiting for food get packed in too, or wait outside. The parking lot is equally small.

Tortas, tacos, burritos, flautas, sopes, you name it; this place has it all and it's all fantastic. I have yet to try something that didn't leave me full, satisfied, and waiting to be hungry again so I could come back.This place is sensational. The prices are low and the food is first rate. Just, do yourself a favor and order to go. The place simply isn't big enough to house all the hungry maize addicts trying to get their fix.",

And it was huge and he said the special spicy sauce was perfect: hot AND tons of flavor. He also ordered the chalupas. There were actually three per plate-it was probably the best shaved pork I've ever had. Either of those dishes alone would have made a substantial size lunch. I ordered the chicken gordita (I think it was supposed to come with beans, but I'm glad it didn't, the chicken was so flavorful and enough on it's own). Lastly (I know we were pigs today!) we had a beef volcane. The volcane was probably our least favorite, but the tortilla it was on, and the cheese it was covered in, were delicious (not soggy at all).Highly recommend for a low-key, cheap, fun, filling meal!",

I ordered two of their \"Taco Mexica\" with chicken, because I'd heard good things about their \"grilled cheese taco.\" The chicken was shredded and barely had any taste to it, which docks major points in my book. There was basically no seasoning in the meat at all, which is why El Charro wins the chicken taco contest by a landslide. The grilled cheese taco thing was interesting, but I honestly couldn't taste the cheese much, and I covet my cheese, so again, I didn't love it. \u00a0The traditional cilantro and onions topping gave it props in my book, but without tasty meat, what's the point? Maybe their beef is the way to go. They include free chips and salsa with your order, and here again I was disappointed. (I'm such a jerk judging free food, aren't I?) The salsa just wasn't my style. I'm basically obsessed with the tomatoey, cilantro-filled stuff El Toro will dole out for free, and I just can't get into spicy traditional salsa. That's a personal preference, though.The guacamole looked really good, but it was mighty expensive. It's $5.95 served with chips, and you get a giant saucer of it, but El Toro serves up some great guac at only $3.50.

Other good things to get are tacos and tostadas. \u00a0if you get a torta, get ready to bring home leftovers because that thing is huge!The meat here could use a bit of salt and pepper. also, don't bother to get the fancy steak taco or fish taco because they dont taste that great. otherwise, everything is delicious!",

They were good.... but not sure how fresh they were since they were already warming under the heat lamps when I sat down. \u00a0 This is a GREAT Mexican restaurant.... but not sure if it's really worth venturing into campustown to MAYBE get a seat AND a parking spot. \u00a0 You definitely don't want to be lugging around a baby in a baby carrier because they'll just wind up sitting next to you on the floor (limited space) --- I mean, like stretch your arms out to your side and that's probably the size of the dining space width-wise. \u00a0 \u00a0Don't even think about bringing a toddler here because again, they won't be able to sit still on the chairs for very long. \u00a0 But if you're by yourself or with a small party, go for it!Other than that, there are other alternatives in town that are just as good (ok, no other place has fish tacos like these, but for other mexican fare, there are good alternatives) such as Taco Loco, the taco trucks (the Mas Amigos at Prospect and Bloomington, and whateveritscalled Taco Truck in the Springfield and County Fair Dr \u00a0area).",

It does everything right, taco, quesadillas, huaraches, and even tortas. It's the level of authenticity you might expect from a place like Nuevo Leon. I wish they just had more seating and were able to offer a dinner type atmosphere and menu. Great lunch and cheap dinner food. They are missing a lot of dinner items such as \u00a0enchiladas, mole, or pozole. However, everything they do do, they do it right. Their salsas are great, their tortillas delicious. Everything has the perfect amount of grease. Seasoning could be better, but it's better that they under salt than over salt. . Definitely try this place out!",

I like lengua, sesos, suadero, barbacoa, al pastor, asada, tripas, carnitas, and buche. I like tacos with pickled radishes and carrots served from trucks parked under LA overpasses late at night.Maize Mexican Grill is seriously legit. Hand rollled tortillas. Huitlacoche. Huaraches. Rib-eye tacos! The fish quesadilla is incredible: it's a hand rolled tortilla filled with cheese and fish, perfectly deep fried with a delicate crispy outside, a soft doughy tortilla inside.The atmosphere is awesome, too. At once bright and airy, and cozy too. Sit at the counter and you can't help but talk with Armando, the owner, and your fellow diners about the food coming out. It's more of a foodie community than just a restaurant.Pro-tip: if you have the time, when you get to order tell Armando that you're in his hands and you'll have whatever he decides to send out. Sit at the counter an be ready to be very happy and very full.",

As soon as I step in, I walk into an extremely cramped space full of people(mostly college students). The interior was rather cheerful and clean.

Despite the shoddy exterior and sheer lack of seating pace, there place possess a warm and inviting feel. \u00a0The food itself is VERY reasonably priced to start with, which to a college student like me is always a plus. The ingredients were fresh and you could easily tell that the food was made to order. My group was first served the complementary chips and salsa, and the freshness of the salsas just shone through. I ordered a vegetarian Torta Ahogada made spicy. I am a sucker for very spicy food, and my oh my was my palate for once was satisfied on this front. It was flavorful and very filling. All in all, Maize offers Mexican food in a less cliched and entirely authentic way. It offers not only freshness of ingredients, but also fantastic value. Of course, the place wasn't designed to ever give people a satisfactory seating experience, but the food more than makes up for it. An A+ from yours truly.",

Is it absolutely terrible? No. Is it the best Mexican food out there? Not even close.I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 1 chicken taco. When I unwrapped my food, I was disappointed to see 3 puney little tacos. They look like tacos you'd order off of some sort of kids meal. However, I'll admit I was wrong about the sizing because they were incredibly filling! At first I didn't even think 3 would fill me, but just 2 and the chips and salsa they give you with every order left my stomach full.So maybe something is wrong with my taste buds, but these were the most bland tacos I've ever had. Probably one of the most bland things I've ever tasted period! I started with the carne asada tacos. Although it was loaded with meat, I could not taste the meat whatsoever. I felt like I was eating an onion and cilantro taco (the only other ingredients on them). Although the cilantro is very fresh and tasty and the onion gives it a good kick, I did not pay for a cilantro and onion on a tortilla...Then I thought maybe it was just the carne asada that isn't their expertise, so I moved on to the chicken taco. Just as bland! It's not even that the cilantro and onion are overpowering, the meat just has absolutely no flavor to is. I don't understand how meat can be that bland. Even unseasoned meat isn't that flavorless.The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I can't speak for everything on the menu. However, that being said, I don't plan on trying anything else on the menu. Sorry, but Maize isn't for me.",

My roommates and I decided to order from Cravings after realizing the Golden Harbor might be too expensive. This was probably a bad decision as we had moved from probably middle tier Chinese to low tier Chinese food in terms of price and quality.The General Tso's chicken was just OK, I've had better and it honestly more resembled orange chicken in both taste and looks.Others got a beef dish and a seafood combination which was on the Chinese menu. I had no clue many of these restaurants have Chinese menus that are often more authentic and probably better quality and tasting than the regular menus. I need to order off those menus and not the Americanized ones for future reference.The fried rice was pretty bland as well. Eggrolls not very good, either.They forgot to include a side order of crab Rangoon and when we called back they said next time we are in the Rangoon will be free. I wasn't impressed with the food but in all fairness it was like $6.50 for a large portion so at least I wasn't hungry afterwards.I still want to try some of the other Chinese places in Champaign as well as ordering off the non-Americanized menus. I think the cuisine is interesting but the quality just hasn't been there at the last couple places I've tried.",

Extra rice was free (which is always should be!) as was the hot tea and ice cold water. The curry and the soup were both delicious.I returned the next time to try their famous hot and spicy chicken.

Sure, it's not the swankiest of places, but if that bothers you so much take your food to go!First of all, the guy running the place is so cool. I told him I wasn't feeling well and wanted some soup. He was like, I have JUST the thing. Not long after, I picked up a huge bowl of soup with big ol' chunks of fish cakes, squid and shrimp. It was a hot and sour seafood soup with noodles, and it was nice and spicy. At most places, when they talk about spicy food, it's not really that hot. Not so at Cravings. I am used to eating spicy food and I was wiping my nose.Gross, I know.Anyway, the ingredients taste fresh and the portions are huge. They provide water and tea for free, which is great when it's cold outside. And they give great takeout containers for soups. I know, it's the little things. I'll definitely be back to try more on the extensive menu. Hm, I wonder if they deliver...",

I'm from Los Angeles, where we claim Monterrey Park and Alhambra as the official China Town of America, at least cuisine-wise, but I find that Cravings beats out most of the places I've eaten at out here.During the year I spent living in Urbana, I frequented Cravings almost every week, and during that time I have tasted almost half the items on the menu.Most students coming grab a lunch-sized dish for $5 or $6, but ordering the $8 or $9 full dishes pays off if you plan to be out studying all day. You get so much food that you can easily take half of it with you to go, so you can finish it later while studying at the library or wherever.Menu highlights include the Mongolian Beef, the Marsala Fish (careful, very spicy!), the spicy crunch chicken, or if you want healthy, the seaweed seafood dishes.If you're just a beginner, you might want to just stick with the Mongolian Beef, General Tso's chicken, or Kung Pao just to experience how they do the classics so well and full of flavor, then move on to other items in subsequent visits.My biggest regret in leaving Urbana is being able to taste the food that this wonderful Malaysian family has brought to corn-field country!",

Nothing saved the day like food from Cravings. Shop Notes: Pretty small shop and gets packed pretty quickly around lunch and dinner.

I get worried what the kitchen looks like and have peeked back there a few times to see complete chaos (mostly because there's 8 or 9 women cooking for too many customers to handle). I love the food, but this place is great to go to maybe a few times per semester. It's just too crowded for my liking.",

So I rarely go to a new Chinese place without someone telling me that it's worth trying.A couple of my husband's co-workers (who were very in-the-know about Chinese food) told him that Cravings was one of the best in town. We tried it, and it became one of our mainstays. We usually order the crispy beef, which is lightly breaded and fried (I think) and then tossed in this incredible sweet-spicy sauce. One order is enough for both of us, and unlike other places that do not use the best part of the cow when they are breading and frying it and tossing it in a delicious sauce, the beef is usually really good--not tough and stringy and fatty and gross.The man who owns Cravings is very nice, and I'm always happy to see crowds eating there. They seem to have authentic dishes along with the Americanized stuff, so if you want a steamed whole fish, you can get one here. I would try other things, but I am too addicted to the crispy beef to move on.",

I had this like everyday last spring); -mapo tofu (really good, spicy, and only 6.50 for a very generous portion); -gado gado chicken (nutty and sweet);-masala fish (crispy and spicy fish fillet); -beef pan fried chow fun (stir-fried beef with large noodle, really good);-Sizzling chicken pot (I have to stress it. it's SIZZLING chicken cooked with basil and onion);-Pepper and Salt Squid (apparently everything starts with \"Pepper and Salt ___\" is really good. Try pepper and salt fish also).Some more Chinese dishes that I like:-black mush room & tofu w/ groundpork;-basil pork with rice;-bean noodles with ground pork (a lot of people asked me what I had when I ordered this dish);-hot & sour seafood noodle soup (tom yum based, with LOTS of seafood, perfectly for a cold day);(these 4 dishes above can be found on the white board near the counter).The Mongolian beef is good but it's not consistent. I like it to be a bit overcooked, but sometimes it's still a little rare to my liking, especially during peak hours.These dishes are all from the Chinese menu since i'm not a big fan of Americanized dishes in general.",

There is no real service, and I don't seem to mind that one little bit. You order at the counter, and for your order you are given a card with a number on it. And a few minutes later, your food/number is called out which you can take back from the counter to your table. Oh yeah, you are expected to bus your own plates once you are done eating. Now the food: they have a wide range of Chinese and adapted Chinese cuisines from Malaysia, India and Indonesia. Their menu is super long but surprisingly this doesn't seem to effect the consistency of the food made. Unfortunately, my food recommendations might not work for you as I am vegetarian. But anyway, Green bean or vegetables stir fry in Hunan sauce seem to my usual picks. Jakarta fried rice with tofu is also something that I really like. They have some soup and Chinese tea for free, which you can ask the owner about. The owner is real friendly and always indulges in the occasional chat if he happens to be unoccupied. I did take a star out though, because sometimes the tables are left dirty. Because of the absence or regular cleaning staff, the tables are left dirty sometimes by inconsiderate customers.

Not fantastic but solid and you gotta get the Irish Nachos to split with a few friends. The food can take a while to come out, especially if they're busy, so just be patient. The best nights at Murphy's are Wednesdays and Thursdays.Wednesday is logo night so you can grab a pint and keep the glass for under $5 and refills are only $2.50 I think. Phenomenal deal. My cabinets are full of awesome logo glasses thanks to Murphy's. Thursdays are phenomenal because it's $2 pints. Any pint for just $2. You'll never beat that. I hear they may have upped it to $2.50 but that's a good variety of decent quality pints for just $2.50. Go out with a $10 bill and you'll have an awesome night. That simple, that's all you need.",

The place caters to the average college-aged individual who is content to fraternize with his or her colleagues over inexpensive alcoholic beverages and greasy diner food. While classier than the average campus-town bar, Murphy's by no means rivals the sophistication of the surrounding bars of downtown Champaign and Urbana. Classically, Murphy's tends to be more popular among the graduate and older undergraduate students, but that doesn't deter alumni and non-student patrons from frequenting. The beer selection outmatches any other bar on the University of Illinois campus and it is a bargain cost-wise compared to the non-campus bars. Food is typically served until 11 p.m. each night, with one of the most popular dishes being the \"Irish Nachos\" - essentially a whole plate of waffle fries decked with nacho toppings that you'll need a friend or two to finish. A host of burgers and other fried foods are also available with various specials throughout the week. \u00a0I have nothing but the fondest memories of Murphy's Pub. There's nothing ritzy about it, but if you're open to having (or reliving!) a fun yet relaxing college night, Murphy's is the place for you!",

It was a sunday and we wanted to catch the NFL games so, naturally, we went up to a bar. Murphy's was our 3rd choice (after the other 2 bars were either closed or not showing any games). The place was empty (not surprising coming from a college town where all they care about is Saturday Football) except for a couple of old guys talking to themselves.They had a lot of TVs and only one game on, when we asked them to switch it they couldn't because they didn't own the football package -strike one-Despite the place being deserted our server never took our order and we had to go up to the bar to have them take it. There is some controversy about this, as some bars will have you do that in the early evening but I've been to bars in the middle of nowhere at the same time where this wasn't the case. Either way, that was a bit annoying, so strike two.Strike three came along when after ordering we had to pick up our own food at the kitchen. At that point we gave up on good expectations and simply sat down to watch the game.The good news is their food is amazing. My friend and I are no fans of fries either but man they were awesome! And their bean burger was gigantic and extremely good according to my friend, while I had the steak sandwich and that was absolutely perfect.In any case, chances are the place is legit on Saturday Game Day, but it's up to you if you want to try it out.",

Also, it's the place to be these days on Thursday nights, as the lines can get insanely long and have up to 30-40 min wait times depending on the night. So my advice to you would be to arrive around 9pm-9:30pm to avoid any lines, cause as soon as 10 o'clock rolls around, you'll be waiting a little bit to get in.The specials are always nice, with the $7 killians on Thursday and $2 Pints for Bluemoon, how could you go wrong? Also, with the new area that opened up, the wait for drinks has gone down to much shorter. Love the new space and the addition of the air-hockey table in the basement as well.

They're appropriately greasy, and when on special you can't beat the price. The chicken fingers leave something to be desired but, hey, it's not perfect.What you go to Murphys for is the beer. The draft list is surprisingly extensive, and while the selection of hard alcohol is weak (says the guy who's finished a whiskey passport at Seven Saints), the specials are fantastic (you can normally get a double of either Beam or Wild Turkey for $5 or less) and they have specialty pints for $2.50 on Thursdays. And it's not bad beer either. I normally get Fat Tire or Angry Orchard, but they even have some decent IPA's on tap (sayeth my beer snob friends). Murphy's is often crowded, and for graduate students, there's a very real risk of running into students, but it's my favorite place in Campustown and a really good bar overall.",

Food is pretty good but sometimes its hit and miss. i've had great irish nachos and i've had terrible irish nachos there. SERVICE IS TERRIBLE they are incredibly rude. 1st examplestanding at the bar watching a football game holding my money out on the counter so bartender knows i want a drink. next thing i know the bartender is in my face \"waving your money around wont get you served faster\". What the hell, i was standing there holding it on the bar, i wasn't even looking at you i was watching tv. 2nd examplecrowded for unofficial so i'm sure they are stressed. close out my tab, paid with a credit card but was going to leave a cash tip. Still reaching for my wallet bartender looks at 50 dollar tab with no tip. \"hey buddy, thats really a jerk thing to do, thanks\" again, what the hell! can i reach in my wallet to give you the cash, needless to say i said yeah your right and left without tipping. 3rd exampleusually the irish nachos are covered in toppings, most recent time hardly any. go back up to counter, its sunday no one is there so its not like its busy. Can i get some more toppings please i didn't get very much. Guy looks at me like i just punched his mother. answers slowly \"yeah... i guess i can\". he was pissed. Dude calm down i just want more toppings, didn't say it was terrible, get over yourself. thank god i love this place. except the servers. and not all are bad, just most.",

We ordered three appetizers for the table. As we were dropping off our bowls to be cooked, the appetizers were being finished. I saw them sitting on the counter, And had a seat where I could see them sit. And sit. Finally the hostess-like person picked the plates up and took the appetizers on a tour of the restaurant. Finally, she brought the cold food to our table. The edamame, quesadillas, and dumplings all had a glaze from the now chilled oil, and all were soggy and cool to the touch. I asked her why they sat for so long, and that's when the real problem started- she LIED and said they just came up. I confronted her and told her that I had watched them sit for 6-8 minutes before she brought them to us, and she stated again that they were fresh. I can understand a service delay when a restaurant is busy, but bad service from a lazy and dishonest employee has no place in the service industry. I confronted her and asked for contact information for the manager, and in return she avoided our table the rest of the meal, hiding in the back room and continuing to avoid her responsibilities. \u00a0It's disappointing that this type of behavior is tolerated by what used to be an amazing restaurant. \u00a0 The restaurant made no attempt to make things right, except to eventually replace the tepid food after our entrees arrived.",

It was just after 4 on a Saturday and we came in to have what I thought would be the only intelligent offering in a town full of children. Right! We were seated and I was one of 4 guests in the building. Our drink order was taken, and because I was in my booth so tight that I didn't want to get up to show my I.D. I changed my order to Sierra Mist! I guess the 4 inches of grey hair hanging from my chin wasn't proof enough that I am not only old enough to drink. But I am also old enough to operate an electric wheel chair! But that had nothing to do with the annoyance factor that was brewing. The kid explained what we had to do and we went on our way. Now I love rice. So much so that I could eat that alone as my meal. Both the white and brown rice tubs were completely empty! So I asked for some and was told they would bring it right out. Then I was told to make my bowl and they would bring it out when it was ready. So I asked a simple question. If you bring it out after the meal is cooked. Than the rice will still be white! With no flavor from what I put in the bowls. Three people told me that it would take 25 minutes to cook the damn rice and they all thought it was hysterical. The manager. A young girl with her hair pulled back to give her that look of authority kept pacing back and forth through the restaurant like she actually had something important to offer. The rice. Is an, if not thee essential part of what this chains menu is built upon! And then you do a group huddle to laugh about it. Now I could see my bowl from across the restaurant sitting on the edge of the griddle. When about thirty people walk in. The cook is still scraping the grill from the time I walked in the door and I knew what was going to happen next. Bowl after bowl about 8 inches higher than the rim were pushing mine further and further away from getting cooked. That's was it. I'm the dude in the Snickers commercial that needs to be fed. But. I kept my cool. Just not my Snidely Whiplash remarks. Every time a server walked by, I asked if the rice was ready yet? I cut the time of that rice down to 15 minutes and that shit was scorched like their underwear after a weekend binge! Of course when it came out I was finished with my meal. I thought that it would be fun to visit a college town and take in some sights. Fuck You! I told my buddy to get the car and lets get the hell out of here!",

The manager appeared to be wearing many hats, seating, serving and bussing tables.Ok, most people are familiar with the process by now. \u00a0The food was good. \u00a0Our server Toni was good. \u00a0Honestly, the only reason I'm giving such a low rating is because the place looked like a disaster area. \u00a0It looked like a tour bus full of people had just left the place. \u00a0Dirty tables everywhere, trails of water and food debris all over the floor. \u00a0The bar area had 10 or so seats, with four of them covered by clipboards, paperwork, and other bar stuff. \u00a0While our server, the bartender and the manager are all trying to make some sense of the place, I head to the bathroom and the busboy is in the back of the room on his phone.The spot in the worst shape was the food line. \u00a0There were veggies all over the counter, sauces splattered all over, a few items were missing tongs, and there was only one guy on a full grill on a Saturday night.If you think about it, there's only one thing FTG offers, and that's the fresh food line. \u00a0If that looks unappealing, then the whole concept looks bad. \u00a0Someone with bad OCD that night would've probably had a Rain Man-style attack.For all the times I visit Champaign (once a year), I'll write off this visit. \u00a0I've been to FTG's that are immaculate, and ones that need some work. \u00a0This one could definitely use a hand.",

I would recommend it for takeout lunch. \u00a0It seems a bit daunting for newbies, but they get through the line the same as the rest of us, and the host gave me a short orientation before I built my bowl. \u00a0Looking at how the place is designed as an operations model, I could definitely see opportunities to improve throughput. \u00a0But eh, I'm not in that business. \u00a0I'm in the business of locating the good eatz and then savoring them with gusto.Which is what I did. \u00a04 stars.",

Of course, even if your stir fry comes out perfectly, I can't say you are going to get your money's worth unless you are hungry enough to finish a second helping for a mere $2 extra. However, even that has its caveats as if you choose to take home anything you don't finish, you'll have to pay $5 extra which will only promote wasting food in my opinion.Still, you may be allured by the freedom of handpicking your ingredients every once and a while, and it's a pretty fun place to go to with your friends.",

Depending on what the screw up is, you'll have to remake your entire bowl and wait a good 30 minutes, made even worse if you are dining with people whose orders turned out fine and will either have to wait for you or just go on ahead without you. They'll usually comp your meal to some degree, but it's still not really worth it. The inside of the restaurant is terribly laid out. Some space is completely unused, whereas the food bar area where you create your bowl is so cramped it's uncomfortable.

The difference is that they have tonnes of raw vegetables and ingredients to choose from. Oh, not to mention, weird sauces and food combinations. My combo was okay (it was brown rice, clams, beef, vege, salmon and roti prata) but if you don't have a sense of what goes with what, then your dinner is going to be a disaster. It's clever of them to have this pick-your-own-ingredients kinda concept because if the food was bad and you complained, they can point their fingers back at you and say that you chose the ingredients. Then again, you are not the only culprit. The grill sensei is responsible as well. If he over-grilled your food, it will taste just as bad no matter how wonderful your selections are. My friend's moo shu was not wrapped very well and some of the rolls fell apart. Well, there goes your dinner. I think it is good to try it once but more that once? You decide.

The variety of sauces and options allow you to experiment with fusions- Indian, Thai, and Chinese options are available. \u00a0I had snowpeas, spinach, cilantro, carrots, pork, and a heap of spicy vindaloo sauce with an Indian roti pancake, which was delicious and filling. However, quality varies...sometimes the grill will overcook the food or mix it with someone else's (yuck!). Overpriced stirfry? Maybe...most of us could do better at home. When your dish is done they bring it to you. Service is good and you can also get drinks and appetizers if your stir-fry isn't enough. While it is a chain, it seems much fresher than nearby Noodles & Co. The major problems? Vegetarians get a bowl of what is essentially vegetables and sauce, which is not a good deal for the price. Crowds can also get horrendous, so make reservations for evenings and on weekends.I also recently tried breakfast here, which really wasn't worth the price. You can get french toast, omelets, pancakes, and scrambled eggs with add-in. There are also snacks like fruit and muffins for while you wait. My scrambled eggs were more like flattened eggs because of the amount of cheese they added and the french toast was a little boring. Not worth 8.99 unless you are willing to eat a lot.",

We decided to stop for a quick lunch and ended up at the first restaurant that opened at 11 AM on a weekday. It was easy to order because we were the first customers of the day. They have a nice laminated menu at the desk to chose your entree. It would be nicer if they had pictures instead of a word description of each item. I selected the combo platter of bulgogi which was 9.99. Afterwards it was a long wait of approximately 25 minutes before we got our food. The dish itself came with a large amount of rice and 2 ban chae along with a bean soup. Based on the pictures I could have chose the beef bulgogi paid less and likely gotten the same amount of food except less variety. The bulgogi was well seasoned, but the meat was cut into smaller slices which detracted from it. Prices have gone up according to my wife since she was in college. Overall slightly above average, I will have to find another korean restaurant to compare too.Pro: average price korean food, large portionCons: long cook time, higher price than average lunch placesHidden gem:Your meal comes with rice, soup, and 2 korean ban chae",

With that said, each and every one of those would try to have their specialty to out-do the others. A-Ri-Rang, in my opinion, does stand out compare to its competitors in its own unique way. In my personal opinion, I find A-Ri-Rang to be much cleaner than its competitors. Furthermore, the layout of the tables were done in such a way that it would not block incoming traffic, which, if you are a regular at Woorijib, would probably understand what I mean. Every day, there is always a lunch special going on. And it is most definitely worth every penny! For approximately $7-8 dollars, you would get a bowl of rice, a fish, and a soup of choice. Now, this may not sound like a lot, but the soup that comes with it is more like a stew. I always get the Soon-dobu jigae (forgive me if I spelled it right). In English? Tofu Stew. It is a LOT more filling than you think if you never had it before. Trust me on this. If there is anything you really need to know about A-Ri-Rang, is that their stew/soup food items are superior than their competitors. Therefore, if you are not sure what you want to get, if you stick with this guideline, you really can't go wrong!With reasonable price and delicious food, I would highly recommend this place to anyone!",

Personally, I think the flavor combinations is great and the burrito is huge (so I always get two meals out of it). My friends and I have all had good experiences with the Korean-Mexican fusion dishes. I've heard mixed reviews of the other items including the bi-bim-bap, but I'm not an expert on Korean food, so I'm not factoring that into this review. I like the space and decorations in Spoon House. However, it is slightly pricier than other establishments on Green Street and I've had experiences where my food can take a bit longer than I would expect.",

It was all mushy and the juices from the meat mixing with the sauce made eating the \"taco\" like eating a moist sponge. I got a bulgogi beef and bulgogi chicken taco, and I noticed this was the same issue for both tacos. The beef was okay, but didn't have much flavor besides being spicy. The chicken was a bit dry, but despite that, it tasted pretty good with a mix of sweet and spicy.

I had Korean tacos for the first time a year ago, in LA, the home of Korean-Mexican fusion. Despite being two thousand miles away, Spoon House's tacos are definitely good enough to compete with those on the west coast. To know my knowledge, they're the only restaurant in town that serves such a dish; they're both delicious and reasonably-priced, which adds to their good reputation. Go for the beef bulgogi taco and the spicy chicken taco, those are the two best. Personally, I feel that they are too heavy to be eaten exclusively as a meal, so you're best off ordering a small rice or noodle dish with several tacos on the side, so it's easier on the stomach. I would avoid the quesadillas, the saltiness overwhelmed the taste of the meat. I can't really speak for the rest of the menu, but those tacos are quite a gem.",

        "review": "I was hoping to be the first to review but oh well :)Spoon House Korean Kitchen just opened on Green Street this week. I was pretty excited to go sometime this week. From the name of the place, Spoon House, I was hoping to sit in front of a hot bowl of traditional Korean soup on a nice cold night but the name was a little deceiving. The place was very bright and well-lit. The menu was lit on flat screen TVs which was a pretty cool feature in the restaurant. The menu consist of Korean-style tacos/burritos, Spoon House trays (Korean-style meat entree), and rice and noodle dishes, however, the menu was limited and a little random? One of the random dish was a ramen and kimbap combo (korean-style sushi) \u00a0which seems like a genius idea since this place is located on a college campus. I mean, what college kid wouldn't like that? My boyfriend and I (yes, I mention him every time I yelp... we like to eat a lot) shared a 3 taco combo special which include a fountain drink for $6.95 and Bulgogi tray. We also got an extra taco (each taco cost $2.00) to divide the food equally. The wait for the food was a little long since it wasn't busy which I can see as an issue during busy hours, but I didn't mind the wait. More importantly, let me talk about my meal....The tacos were nothing special. If you get the 3 taco combo special, it's nice that you can mix your pick of types of taco meat (bulgogi beef, bulgogi chicken, sweet and spicy chicken, or spicy pork). In my opinion I thought the tacos were eh okay. On a good note, the tacos felt light. I didn't feel like I want to roll home like I do when I eat Chipotle's burrito. The Bulgogi tray was pretty disappointing... maybe because of my Korean background, and growing up with awesome Korean mom/cook, I judge Korean meals critically. The bulgogi tray came with rice, side salad, 2 puny potstickers, an eggroll, and sweet potato fries. Suggestion... if you claim you're a Korean restaurant, why wouldn't you add kimchi in the tray? Kimchi is ubiquitous dish for Koreans. It's kinda of an insult to not have Kimchi at a Korean restaurant. Overall, the experience (food, service, atmosphere) wasn't terrible but \u00a0it was mediocre. It seems like Spoon House has catered their menu towards Western's taste. The food seems healthy and fresh, which you don't really get from other restaurants on Green Street. I wouldn't mind going to there again, but I might have to try something else on the menu. I wish their business good luck.",

Many Korean cooks have their own personal recipes for making that particular sauce. My mother uses sesame oil, sprite, fresh garlic, and other ingredients.Also, I believe Spoon House is following the trend on the West coast of putting Korean-style prepared meats into typically Mexican fare, such as burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. As such, the name bulgogi burrito is not offensive. My personal experiences at Spoon House have not been that great. Ddukbokki is one of my favorites, and I was slightly disappointed by their version. The dish had less heat and more sweetness than I cared for. I also did not care for their yukgaejang. The kimchi that was available on my first visit was watered down and bland, but was improved on my second visit. The bulgogi quesadilla, however, was pretty tasty, and I enjoy their bright colorful interior.

The satisfaction wore off, and the nightmare began, like so many B-grade horror movies. Fast forward to Saturday night. My stomach feels like it's being stabbed by a thousand treacherous knives, and my boyfriend is not doing much better. We're getting chills, we're achy, and we can't do much beyond lay on our backs and bemoan our pathetic existence.Around 10:30, calamity hit. Our apartment bathroom devolved into a Lord of the Flies scenario, with both of us fighting past each other to find something, anything, to throw up into. Vomit the consistency of wet granola spewed out of each of us like buckshot. I will spare you the details of our other bodily functions, but let's just say that by dawn, our bathroom resembled a Pollock. My boyfriend only vomited once. One of the unfortunate souls we dined with threw up over twelve times All of us were too weak to do much beyond lay on our respective bathroom floors, undergo unspeakably painful stomach cramps, vomit, and pray for an Easter miracle. Spoon House, all of Neptune's great ocean will not wash this blood from your hands. We're graduate students. We all have deadlines and conferences coming up, and having to sleep in a bathtub because I just can't stop throwing up is not the best use of my time. The fact that all five of us had different dishes just underscores the fact that you guys need to start following health code before you get shut down. As per my scorched earth policy, I will never go back and I will warn all of my friends about your culinary betrayals. Get it together.",

The Sicilian is a thick crust pizza with a sweet sauce, it's really delicious. The are vegetarian options galore from artichoke pizza to pasta pizza. The food overall is definitely food on the go I'd say catering to the student lunch and drunk 1am crowd. Antonio's would definitely hit the spot to satisfy that hunger while you're drunk. Prepare for some clogged arteries because their pizza is pretty greasy, but I don't complain. The flavors aren't complex, but we're talking pizza here folks. \u00a02 slices of pizza will probably run you from $4 to $6 so you definitely get full.Note: Their water is free, but the temperature in the sports looking water cooler is usually tepid. Pop is $1 and refills are 50 cents.I've never ordered delivery, but I image that would be a nightmare (I've only seen one Antonio's car in their lot) so stick to dine in or carry out.Looking for cheap, greasy, satisfying food?

There's also a steak and bacon ranch, subbing ranch for BBQ, obviously. Buffalo chicken bleu is spectacular, with lots of blue cheese and good vinegar hot sauce. The tortellini is good, but I've had the shells be undercooked before, and if they have the gyro pizza, you should not miss it. SOOOOO good. And it's $3 a slice for a massive slice. At 2am, I'm usually pretty hungry, but even then two slices is a lot for me. This never stops me from getting two, though.OK - it's not ultra gourmet, wood oven pizza. and yes, it's kinda greasy.

My all time favorite though is the Chicken Bacon Ranch SICILIAN slices, I could seriously have that be the only thing I eat for the rest of my life. Great place to come for the drunken munchies after the bars or at any other time of the day.

I am EXTREMELY picky about my pizza and as far as I'm concerned pizza sucks outside of New York and I really don't eat it in other states because it is so far from what pizza is supposed to be, most of the time. But this place is one of the few exceptions I'll make. So many places call themselves New York pizza and claim to be New York pizza, and many of them succeed fooling the tourists or locals who don't know any better. In fact there is a pizza place 2 doors down from here that sucks so bad, but it's always packed with drunk idiots. Granted, this place is tiny and there may be a wait, but it is so worth it. REAL New York pizza in a pizza parlor with New York attitude, the way it's supposed to be! And for pete's sake, by the slice the way it's supposed to be! When you want a quick lunch, who wants to wait around for a whole pizza to be cooked at \"personal\" small size which means more dry lousy crust and less good middle pizza? Everyone in NY learned that a century ago and somehow the rest of the country hasn't caught up? I love that the kids working there blast metal music and just don't care because they know they've got the best pizza and people will come regardless. Arinell's: Keep on keepin' on! I Love You.

Inside is pretty cool, open style kitchen and lots of indoor seating. The menu is on the counter where you order, which could be problematic if you are like me and take 5 minutes to look at a menu and there are people behind you!I decided on a 4oz gyro and mac and cheese bites. My name was taken and I was called when it was ready. Interestingly enough, you also pay right when your food is ready, which was different, but I liked it!I dashed home and unwrapped everything, anxious to try it. My gyro was actually pretty small and almost resembled a taco in size and shape. I did think that this gyro was really on point though. The meat was thicker, flavorful, not too greasy and of a good consistency. The tzatziki was really good, too! Kind of creamy but not too yogurt-y or watered down like some places. The mac and cheese bites were also surprisingly good. Usually these are just dry pieces of mush but on the inside they were warm, gooey and tasty! Overall I would definitely say the Zorba's has the best gyro in the CU area, but I still need to try more places.The only thing I did not like was the portion/price. My gyro was not very big, I probably could have ate 2-3 of them. However, quality over quantity any day of the week and this was one tasty gyro that would really give my suburban favorites a run for their money.I'll be back to try more!",

Both their chicken and original (I believe it is a mix between beef and lamb) gyros are mouth-watering. I was afraid that the lamb would have that weird gamey taste, but it only made for a more complex flavor, which I totally didn't expect. They have a great selection of sauces that I am guilty of drowning my gyros in. Their fries are made to order and come out piping hot and are even more delectable with a dipping sauce concoction of my own (made by combining their honey mustard and cucumber sauces - must try). What I found surprising is that no one knew about their unlimited and FREE toppings list. You can get a whole assortment of other toppings on your gyro all at no charge!Two years ago, they started catering to the drunk, after-bars crowd on Fridays and Saturdays. However, those gyros are a fraction of the size and a fraction of the goodness of their regular ones. So I'd stick to One World to fulfill that drunken craving if I were you...*Also, I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but I always come out of the restaurant smelling like I've dipped myself in frying oil.

Now that I am back I have found out that there are multiple locations which works out well. The prices are actually cheaper than when I was here for college due to a modification in the menu. For the pasta you get to select from multiple types and sauces with 4 toppings for 5 dollars. The premium protein items i.e shrimp, meatballs, chicken will run you a dollar more each. The food is prepared quickly, however I don't know if they changed it now to use a convection oven/microwave to nuke your toppings which is one down side. This is then added to a pan with the sauce and served quickly. You also get a nice piece of garlic bread. All and all this is better than McD and for the same price. There are also other options such as pizza, salads, sandwiches etc. I have never strayed from the pastaPro: inexpensive, quick, large portionsCons: microwaved toppings (i guess you get what you pay for)Hidden gem:Sign up for the perka app. You need to check in and tell the cashier so they can give you the punch to earn free food.

I came here for the first time yeeears ago on my violin teacher's recommendation (she is a \u00a0U of I graduate and had many fond memories of the place). I have been here several times since; I always try to stop by when I'm in the neighborhood. Za's has an excellent location near campus and a lot of other restaurants, apparel shops, ice cream/froyo places, etc. Eating here can be a bit overwhelming at first because there are SO many options! You fill out a sheet of paper to describe exactly what you want with options from salads, paninis, soups, pizzas, smoothies, and more. The big selling point of Za's is that you can customize your order to exactly how you want it with any toppings, sauces, or flavors--any way you want it! After ordering, you scoot on over to the pick-up counter and wait for your food to be ready. There are tables both upstairs and downstairs, so don't fret if every table is taken on the first floor. The stairs are kind of steep, so be careful as you walk up there with your food! I usually order the \"pick two\" option. My favorite is the broccoli cheddar soup with the \"lite panini,\" which can be customized exactly how you want it. The broccoli cheddar here is one of my favorites and has grated cheddar cheese on top. Yum. The food is by no means mind-blowing. Overall, this is your standard Italian lunch food with a few very above average options, like the soup. I also highly recommend trying the smoothies here (my drink of choice is the mango). They use real fruit and fruit juice!Honestly, if you're in the area, you really can't miss a stop at Za's. Note: I last ate here before it burned down, so I can't speak to the quality of the original's replacement.",

If there isn't enough room on the main floor you can head upstairs to find more tables, and a warm atmosphere with a very beautiful copper ceiling, and Italian inspired artwork on the walls.Their menu is full of incredibly tasty and healthy ingredients, and everything is cooked to order. It'll probably take longer for you to decide on what to order with the custom Pizza, Pasta, Panini, and Salad options. But never fear for those you that are indecisive; Mia Za's offers more traditional favorites as well.Prices vary on what kind of sauce or items you get, and if you get extra items. With that said you can get a \"Pick 2\" where you get half an order of pasta, salad, or panini served with another half order of salad, soup, or panini for just shy of 7 dollars (without drink).",

I had garlic marinara sauce with a feta/mozzarella mix topped with red onions, olives, and sun dried tomatoes. It was kick-ass! I ate (most) of the whole thing. I did give away some of it because it was too good not to share. I had been to this place a few years ago (before it burnt down and was rebuilt) and I remember having something delicious then, too!

The pasta sauces are all really tasty, and there are plenty of healthy veggie toppings. Let's not forget the amazing garlic bread, which is one of the best parts of any Za's trip. Can we please talk about the fact that Za's really needs to open a location in the Chicago area? Until then, I'll just have to wait and get my fix next time I'm down in CU. Sigh.",

I ordered the Mussamun curry, which is my favorite Thai dish. I've never been disappointed until today. It was weirdly tangy, and missing both the sweetness and spiciness I generally expect. My wife enjoyed her Pad Thai, but it tasted really oily to me, with too much cabbage. There's no kids' menu, so we had to improvise. We got them chicken fried rice to share. Funny enough, this was far and away the best dish we tasted tonight. It was legitimately good, and about the only thing saving it from 1-star.It's disappointing...

Noodle soup servings are on the smaller side. The service is horrible. It basically comes down to cultural differences. The customer is almost never right. My last trip, my friend and I decided to share a dish. I asked for extra rice. I opened up the menu to the list of \"sides\", pointed at it, and said \"extra jasmine rice\". The cashier wrote our order on the receipt and wrote something in Thai under our. I assumed it was an extra plate of rice.Our order came with one plate. I told the Hispanic server that we didn't get our extra rice. He nodded and went away. It was apparent the rice wasn't coming, so I talked to another lady at the counter. She said I had to pay for the rice. I said I had ordered it. She said I didn't. We figured out that the cashier thought I wanted MORE rice (we didn't get more than a normal serving though), not a separate side order of rice. This misunderstanding is fine, but she insisted I pay for the rice. Rice is very cheap! It wasn't my fault the cashier didn't understand my order for \"extra rice\". I was turned off by the whole exchange. To top it off, the rice we had and were eating had a small strand of hair in it! On our way out, I told the cashier that I found hair in our rice. I thought they should know. The lady didn't respond at all to me. She just turned around and walked into the kitchen.

The first dish I ordered there, Pad See Ewe, I instantly became a fan of. It remains unchanged on their menu, which keeps me going.For the price of their entrees (~$7), you're bound to leave the place happy and content. The thai iced tea, while a bit on the expensive side, is also a treat with any meal. Unfortunately it's price and the lack of free refills (~$2) makes me feel a bit unsatisfied.It's certainly not the best thai food I've had, but it's definitely not the worst either.

Many of the complaints from other reviewers seem to be primarily associated with food poisoning and (strangely) the basil chicken. \u00a0I've eaten at Basil Thai well over 50 times in the past 3 years, and I've never personally encountered food poisoning (fingers crossed?). \u00a0As for the basil chicken, I am sure that there are all sorts of regional variations of this dish, but I am mostly familiar with the ground chicken version that seems so revolting to my fellow reviewers. \u00a0Google a recipe for the dish and you'll see that Basil Thai isn't using ground chicken just to be offensive.",

Its a particular favorite for groups because you pay up front and don't need to worry about splitting the bill. The quality of food really depends on what \u00a0you order. Chicken, except for the satay, is typically not high quality. Beef is the better choice if you like meat. Vegetarian dishes are quite good here though and they do use a lot of vegetables I like such as zucchini and bell pepper. I like the curries and they are pretty spicy, but lack a certain complexity in flavor present at other Thai places. The only truly atrocious curry, which you should avoid, is the panang, which is almost like vegetables in a thick sauce rather than a curry.Besides the curries, I love the Thai veggie egg roll appetizer- noodles and vegetables rolled in a rice pancake. Beats Chinese egg rolls any day. Unfortunately the spring rolls are not so good. They are assembled bizarrely so you can't really eat them without seeming just a little rude as they fall apart in your hands and you are forced to gobble each piece in one giant bite. The peanut spring rolls are the worst offender, as they are both improperly assembled and drenched in a sweet sticky sauce. Not the best Thai food, but a good choice for groups and vegetarians.Just to warn you, but their tray system is idiotic. You clear your own tray and the rack you put them on doesn't fit the trays well. Glass breakage and embarrassment ensue.",

Ever since then, I would order their Pad Kra Paow (sp?) with chicken, which is the basil chicken (ground). The portion is very good in my opinion - one order would normally last me two meals. I *always* order my food from there with 2 stars when it comes to spiciness. I love my food spicy! No Thai restaurants in Chicago makes their Pad Kra Paow like them! I've tried at least 7 different restaurants already and it disappoints me every time. Sometimes I feel like driving at least 2 hours down to Chambana *just* for this dish. The wait is not too bad but if it's during lunch time, it can get pretty ugly. Grab one of their menu, phone in your order, and get it to-go so you won't have to wait more than 10 minutes for your meal. I used to call in a lot and pick it up when I walk in. Also, they do cater food so make sure you ask them about that. I took my siblings and 2 friends here post-graduation. I did call in beforehand to reserve a table. They're pretty good with this! They have another restaurant on Green St. but I think the food tastes a lot better here. I believe they have the same owner for these two Thai restaurants on campus.",

I've never had a pad thai so oily and \"fried\" tasting. It's good, but it's heavy. And it's not what I'd consider \"pad thai\", rather some sort of Basil Thai original creation. The other noodle dishes are all the same way. The main dishes with rice are better, but still nothing memorable. Salads are absolutely not recommended, with greasy meat thrown on top of chopped iceberg lettuce. I have heard good things about the soup, but never tried it myself.

I always get pad thai the 1st time I eat at a Thai place to see how they manage this standard dish. Many complaints. While I am thrilled that they actually offer spicy food (you can pick from 5 levels, I chose 4), I expect the various elements of the dish to retain individual flavors, and this dish, as served to me, failed. Every bite tasted exactly the same. Egg tasted like tofu tasted like carrot tasted like broccoli. No lime came with it. This is an order at the counter place with no table service once they bring your food so I had to get up and ask. There were ground peanuts on my plate, but despite a table offering the traditional granulated sugar, hot green peppers, and a red hot pepper sauce, there was no option for more ground peanut. The tofu was cut into tiny bits which made them hard to find. The veggies on the other hand were roughly cut and much larger. Cooked well, though. Texture was right, but all one flavor. Once I was able to squeeze lime juice on it the meal improved somewhat, but I really didn't want to eat this once I took first few bites. I actually wondered where the last homeless person I saw was so I could pass this on. I'm taking the leftovers to go. Maybe I'll update this to say what I do with them.

The Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, though, was aromatic and worth the extra charge (though it's reasonable to expect that the menu had listed the price or the waiter had known it after I asked: no luck on either).I waited much too long to place my order after sitting (and it was not busy). \u00a0But the prosciutto and gruyere omelet (which I added spinach to with no problem) that arrived vastly exceeded expectations: it was flavorful, chock full of good ingredients and not overcooked. The pan-fried potatoes were spiced but not overly salty (though I sent them back when they arrived with a huge dollop of unmentioned sour-cream--ew).The baked bread was sourdough and crusty and a perfect accompaniment.

It is fresh and out of the oven by 11am during school days. I have not seen other places in the area that sell zufte but the bread is really worth trying. Oh, if you have cravings for day old bread, they sell them at half price.They also have a wonderful selection for dinner. Daily specials change quite often but they have their regular dinner menu. I usually go with the daily special. This place also has fondue, both cheese and chocolate. I had both and I have to say that they are pretty stingy with their cheese and chocolate. I had barely enough to cover the fruit or bread. Do expect $12-$17 for entrees and about $10 for fondue. By the way, they sell cheeses too in the day.They have pretty good service but the people do not seem to smile a lot during the day, especially the owner.

        "review": "Something has got to be done about the abominable service at The Bread Company.. It's such a shame because their food is not bad, but the service is so badly below standard, I decided I am simply never coming back here.There is one particular worker with tattoos on his arm who is very insolent towards customers, raising his voice at them for asking questions.For months, I've ordered a grilled sandwich to pick up for lunch time, and the result is totally random. If the owner (tall bald guy) is there when you call, chances are you'll get a good sandwich with the potatoes and salad on the side, but if he's not there, watch out: there's no telling what you'll get. Sometimes they include potatoes and salad with the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they slice the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the sandwich is available since the grill is on, and other times it's not even available since they turn off the grill in the middle of the day to save money randomly.Today for example, I went to pick up my grilled sandwich to-go, and was surprised to see that on this occasion there were no potatoes and salad included, even though two weeks ago I ordered around the same time and they were included. So I asked the short-haired lady in front of me behind the register, \"are there potatoes and salad?\" (pointing at the sandwich) and she stared directly at my eyes without answering! So I repeated the question and she stood there completely quiet, staring at me without answering, when the tattooed arm punk butted in our conversation, cocked his head at me and yelled, \"didn't we go over this already?!\" Don't bother coming here. Unless the owner fires some of the incompetent and insolent flunkies buzzing behind the counter soon, this place needs to go out of business ASAP.",

The grilled cheese sandwich is substantial and generally yummy (though hot sandwiches are served during a very small time frame), but the salads and soups are serviceable to dire. I'm never very excited to eat their salads, which consist of slightly wilting greens, but the soups taste like they came from an industrial-sized Campbell's soup can. Murky chicken noodle broth and sparse chicken and noodle? No thanks. At lunch with a friend, her very basic soup held vegetables suspiciously similar to that recognizably uniform shape and size of the bagged frozen sort. It definitely does not seem as if the soups are freshly made, at all. The lunch hasn't ever made me want to come to dinner for fear of similarly cut corners.",

Although it was fondue for two, there was only one piece each of the more high quality dipping items (cookie, strawberry, etc.)I will certianly not be back for dinner and probably not for lunch either since there are a variety of other lunch places in town that are just as good or better that are easier to get to, Paradiso in particular.",

Portions are quite large and one sandwich could probably be shared easily among two adults. Sometimes I forget this and end up making two meals out of one sandwich.During lunch hours this place is quite crowded, but by late afternoon it becomes serene. Soft green light floods in from the skylight and during the winter you can sit the fire with a baguette and a glass of wine. \u00a0As regards to the review that mentioned rudeness about adding protein to things, I've heard that happen many times during lunch and now they let you have your meat, but charge a lot for it. They have this bizarre policy because they \"don't want people making their own sandwiches with the bread that comes with the entree.\" Nice one. At night it becomes more formal, with candlelight, fondue, and more upscale entrees. The balsamic potatoes that come with the entrees are perfect. I like the fondue, but it's a little too much for me...even the small pot can be shared by two. Last time I was there I tried the tapas and the yellowfin tuna and the lamb were delicious, but I was less than enthusiastic about the duck mousse, which had a bland sickly sweet flavor. The greens that came with the tapas were also pretty inexcusable. When I go to a good restaurant I expect more than just some shredded romaine, especially when field greens are still in season. The new small desserts are also not so great. The chocolate mousse was good, but the bread pudding was just some bread soaked in eggs and sugar.",

The only reason I continue to go back has got to be because I forget about how sub-standard their food is. And today I decided to finally put my disappointment on the internet.This review was spurred by a visit today to get coffee and a pastry. I ordered an americano that was obviously made with poor quality espresso, and perhaps by someone with little knowledge of what an americano should be. It was too watery, but maybe that is my taste. I also had what they dared to call a chocolate croissant. It could have been made days ago. Instead of being light and fluffy, it was dense and doughy and filled with chocolate chips that were never fully melted so they maintained their chip structure. I was less than impressed. But this seems to be the way things go at the Bread Company.As I mentioned earlier, I have been going to the Bread Company for quite a few years (having been at the U of I as a student since 2008), and their menu has yet to change. At all. This sort of stagnancy is worrisome and really speaks to the lack of effort that the chef and/or owner put into this business.On a recent dinner visit I got the chocolate fondue which came with possibly pre-made cinnamon bread slices, strawberries, and a plethora of apples and pears. I suppose the apples and pears were in season (it was November when I went), but I don't see how apples work with chocolate. I've had their pizza many times, and I cannot deny that they do a good crust...but I just don't get the pizza that comes with a mountain of salad on top. It is just too much and overwhelms the pizza that really should be the star of the dish.Overall the Bread Company is uninspired and very tired. This is reflected in their dusty, unchanging interior, their menus, and the often impolite, lackluster performances of the staff.",

Sometimes I went for the half soup/half sandwich, or half salad/half sandwich to get more variety in my diet. The food here is like comfort food for me, since I grew up in Urbana and my mother used to buy these sandwiches and their large loaves of freshly baked Z\u00fcpfe for my brothers and me. The service at The Bread Company has always been fast and efficient, and the employees were always very cool and made no mistakes taking my order and making me a really good sandwich. I've been here a few times for dinner with my friends. The atmosphere totally changes in the evening for dinner, as they lay out white tablecloths, dim the lights and allow the romantic glow of candles set the mood. Their pizza is delicious and filling, and their tapas come in pretty big portions. This is a cute and cozy place for anyone on a date or double date, or out to celebrate a special occasion.I've ordered take out from them a few times when I've had last minute dinner party pot lucks to attend and didn't have time to cook. One time, I picked up a strawberry walnut mixed green salad, which was perfect, and also a french baguette with a side of baked garlic bulbs drizzled with olive oil.

Tables aren't bussed, there is dust on the paintings, trays of dirty glasses sit out, the walls aren't cleaned. Heck, the pizza/empanada place around the corner is often cleaner than The Bread Company. Sometimes the wait staff is really nice. Sometimes they are brats. Devil or angel, they rarely know what they are doing. Want more coffee? The nice waiter will forget; the brat glare at you. Either way, you don't get the coffee. For a long time, The Bread Company was one of a handful of restaurants that served decent food in C-U. Even after C-U got more restaurants, there still was a long period of time when there was no other decent restaurant in the area. The result seems to be that the Bread Company has gotten used to figuring it has a captive audience and so does not have to work for customers. That attitude seems to permeate everything it does.

I'd eat here probably once a week if not more and switch off between wings, salad, chicken tenders, or spinach artichoke dip. It was all amazing, every time.But sadly, my old stomping grounds have become disappointing.I came here back in May for a random visit and saw they added an AMAZING sandwich to the menu, the Southwest Chicken. Grilled chicken, provolone, pepper and onions, and avocado? YUM. Paired with onion rings and I knew this would be my new go-to on their menu.Flash forward to a couple weeks ago when I came down for Homecoming. My friends and I literally parked the car in a garage a block away and went straight to Firehaus. Ah, the nostalgia! The memories! THE GOOD FOOD!I ordered the Southwest Chicken with a side of onion rings, like I had been dreaming about all day. When it came out I was immediately disappointed to see they had replaced the fresh avocado slices with some sort of avocado PASTE. Yuck! It smelled and tasted bizarre so I scraped it off. Bye, delicious chicken sandwich! Now you are merely of slightly-above-average taste.The next day I came in for lunch, because who actually goes to Illini football games anymore? I decided to get a side salad and wings, and everyone at the table ordered a drink with their food. The waitress brought out everyone's drinks except mine, which I found strange since I had just ordered a bottle of Bud Light Platinum. After another server brought out everyone's food and not mine, I flagged down our server and the look on her face when I asked about my food was one of, \"Oh shit.\" So she ran away and came back a couple minutes later explaining she forgot to put in my order originally. Well, duh, I kind of got that. She apologized profusely and said I'd get a discount on my bill.The wings were worth the wait, honestly, and the salad was as good as I remembered. But then the part where my bill came? No discount. At this point we were rushing off to go to another bar and my friend was nice enough to just pay for my tab, but come on. If you're going to screw up my order and then promise a discount, deliver on it.Maybe I'm just picky, or maybe I expected more from a place I used to frequent. Or maybe it lost its shine.

I felt kind of bad because I was already in a very committed relationship aka married. But really, I wasn't sending misleading creepy signals or being charming either. For the longest time I thought it was the smell of my hair wax I was using to style my bed hair when I would go out to socialize with friends. But I tested this theory numerous times in other cities and no dice. Yes, the wife was not with me at other venues.Investigatively (not a real word)... I think on certain weekends, the local gals come here to find their knight and shining armor to take them away from the small town. But here is the thing, u will never know if she is a local until she tells you. But I came here enough to observe and identify how to spot these rare and undiscovered people. First off, they are extremely beautiful, like the tone of their skin was almost natural and organic... unmanipulated by the city or fake UV rays. They dress differently, no labels and no blig. And here is the kicker, they talk differently. Their topics of discussion are not layered from the dry vocabulary of the bullshit literary material University students are being brain washed in (this includes myself). One big clue seemed to be the type of questions they asked. University girls typically asked questions like what are you studying, where have you interned, what year in school are you? But I noticed the local asked a key differentiating question: where are you originally from?---if you decode this question, it's underlying motive is can you take her away from her boring hometown.Keep in mind, this place is not swarming with these type of treasures. A treasure is a treasure to be found. I write this review because I hope to read or hear about somebody finding their future other half at Firehaus.

I also subbed the house bun for a pretzel bun to kick this burger up a notch. The result is a mouthwatering combination of sauce, meat, cheese, and bun that is first-rate. If the beef was only a little more flavorful and juicy this campustown burger would be amongst some of the better I've had.

Honestly, what is the point of maintaining the line that close to closing when the bar itself is not at capacity??Evening:We came here at the end of Fall semester as an organization to celebrate a job well done. Our group of 10 was seated promptly and the waitress did an awesome job in accommodating our group. We came on a Thursday I think which meant $3 burger with AMAZINGGGGGG fries. Their fries are double fried so they have a great crispy crust. On top of that, they have a good selection of beer on tap to complement your meal.

Prior to eating here, I knew from other reviews that the service wasn't the best, but I wanted to go to the restraunt without letting this info skew my opinion. However, I got there and received some of the worst service I've ever gotten. Right off the bat, the young man at the counter was not welcoming at all - it seemed like he didn't want to be working. I asked him if there were any sections for lunch specials in the menu because I saw \"lunch special!\" written on one of the laminated pictures, and he rudely replied with \"no lunch specials.\" Okay then...I paid with my debit card and they do it with an iPad, making you pay tip while they're pointing the iPad at you, which I thought was a bit rude. I gave 15% but I shouldn't have because this guy was extremely rude and they don't serve you at all. It's all self service. Also, I asked for no onions in general for my tofu soup, but when I received my food, there were green onions on top. So I said I had asked for no onions and the guy that took my order first gave me attitude saying \"that's not onions, you didnt tell me no green onions, you just said onions.\" And I replied with, \"they're still onions... I said no onions, I thought that was very clear.\" And he replied with \"you need to specify what you want.\" And I just shrugged it off and was already annoyed with him at this point where I just took the food because I didn't want anymore trouble, and the woman who gave me my food asked the guy as I was leaving if I had an onion allergy where he replied to her saying I had none, I just didn't like them. This was so rude because he doesn't know me (what if I did have allergies) nor was it necessary for him to make it my fault that I didn't specify what kind of onions I didn't want, when I didn't know there were two different types of onions in the soup.

The food isn't cheap (around $10-12 for an average lunch), but the place fills up. Most meals include a second bowl of rice for free and a side of kimchi (radish and cabbage style), which is good. The food is not elegant or fancy -- it is tasty, basic, and homestyle. To me, this is comfort food, the kind you might make yourself at home if you had the time (and tended toward Korean comforts). The beef bulgogi comes out sizzling, with thin sliced and seared white onions. It has been marinated in a sweet soy sauce and this sweetness caramelizes nicely upon grilling. The portion is big and filling.The manduguk has a chicken broth base, and includes loads of mild beef dumplings. As is traditional onions, scallions, and eggs flavor the broth with a little dash of dried kelp on top.The dolsot bibimbap is yummy. The meat was not marinated beef in strips, as I've had in the past, but ground beef (that was just okay). The mixed, steamed veggies and the chili paste with fried egg on top were delicious mixed with the crisped rice on the bottom. All that was finished just right.Just to clarify what I've seen in other reviews, when you go in, your whole table orders at the counter together and is given a shared number. When someone from your table has an order up, your number is called. It may be called several times, at different points. If you order a dish that takes longer to prepare than others (like the manduguk) you will find other numbers higher than your own being called. These folks aren't cutting in line -- it's just part of the kitchen's process.Once you pick up your order, you will stop by a side table near the counter to get your silverware / chopsticks, etc. When you have finished, you return to the front on the other side with your tray, which you place in a cafeteria cart. Efficient, no frills, but relatively fast even on busy days (15-20 minutes to get served something cooked up fresh to order).BTW, I've also heard some reviewers writing in to say they feel they've been treated differently because they weren't Korean. I am a Caucasian American and have felt well treated at Woori Jib. Yes, the cashier has assumed on occasion that I and the white people in line behind me are eating together because, well, white. But that's no big deal. The owner thanks me after every stop and the cashiers have helped me to explore and order.",

After ordering your food, it typically takes 10-15 minutes to get your food, and it doesn't always come out in the same order as you ordered. On top of that, you'll often have other people that cut into line and get the same food that you ordered before they did.On this occasion, I ordered duk mandu guk and it came with soggy seaweed in it. For the price of $10, it was a bit more expensive than other Korean restaurants in the area. In addition, it didn't taste spectacular to any degree. The only consolation was that it came in such a big bowl that I could take a little bit home for a leftover meal.Another dish that is pretty popular is their BBQ bulgogi. It usually comes with a special sauce but it really depends on the day to figure out whether it's good or not. Sometimes, it's under cooked. Other times, it's over cooked and burnt. They also use about a 50% onion to 50% meat ratio so it seems like you are paying for a lot of onions and not a whole lot of meat.The seating is usually crammed so during rush hours, it's hard to find a seat. There is very little room to back your seat out as seats are pretty much back to back.",

I ordered the spicy pork and got some tofu soup on the side. \u00a0When the food came out, the portion size was not as big as other restaurants like Ari-rang or Bwon and did not have much flavor to it. It was kinda bland and not as spicy as I would've like it. Now I remembered one of my friends telling me you could get umlimited soup, so I went to the little station they had set up and it was seaweed soup. The problem with it was that it tasted like water and no flavor at all, so besides it being unlimited, one bowl was enough for me. Everything else was pretty good, the ban chan was good and I enjoyed the free refills on everything, and tofu soup portions were actually of good size.

The restaurant had a nice ambiance and the wait staff was professional. I ordered the halibut with brussels sprouts and proscuitto. The lemon beurre blanc sauce served with the fish was divine. The white wine I had was also very good. I was too full for dessert but wanted to try the lemon tart so I ordered it to go. I figured I could have it later while I worked in my hotel room. I was surprised when I got my bill and saw that I was charged .50 for the container b/c I asked for the tart to go. It's not a big deal but after paying over 60.00 for my meal (for one), this left a negative impression. I've gotten dessert to go at other restaurants of all different price ranges and have never been charged for a container. I wonder if I had eaten part of the tart at the restaurant and then asked for the rest to go if they would have still charged me the .50. Again, not a big deal but this changed my impression of Timpone's from being an upscale restaurant to a fine restaurant wanna-be.",

All of the servers were very friendly and professional, and I could tell they all looked out for each other. Case in point, I noticed some lint on one of my glasses of wine, and before I could even say anything, one of the other waiters saw me studying the glass and quickly came over and offered to replace it.Speaking of wine, the selection was great, but I was unfortunately relegated to the limited \"wine by the glass\" menu since I was the only red wine drinker at my table. Even so, the selection of wine by the glass was well-rounded and pretty solid, and our waiter's wine recommendations were spot on. Now, for the food!Bread and olive oil is complimentary, of course, and very tasty (so simple...but so good!). For starters, we ordered the crab cakes as well as a spring salad with walnuts and gorgonzola, both of which were very good. For my entree, I had the roast duck, which came with fingerling potatoes, red cabbage, spring vegetables. The entire dish was fantastic. Moist duck, perfectly cooked vegetables, and a wonderful sauce that had blueberries in it. A simple dish done very, very well.In all, Timpone's is a great place for a gourmet meal at a pretty decent price. They have a nice selection of veg-friendly dishes, too (not vegan, however). I can't recommend this place enough. Give it a try!",

To be fair, he is much better at understanding flavor dynamics on paper than I am, which is probably why we ended up with two different experiences.This review is split into two parts: the ambiance and service aspect, followed by the food review. My husband and I agree, though, that two stars are definitely warranted for the former portion.There are three important items to note before entering Timpones. The first is that the decor is absolutely ridiculous; reminiscent of a Miami night club circa 1984. The second thing is that the wait staff do not seem to know what's going on, which can perhaps be attributed to the third thing. The manager yells at their wait staff in front of all patrons, which I can only assume makes the wait staff SUPER NERVOUS. Of course, I am generalizing based on one experience, and yet it seems other Yelpers share similar sentiments.Of course, the above items relate strictly to ambiance and service. Important, but not the end-all, be-all of a meal, so let us move on.We started off with a goat cheese and arugula salad. On paper, this was an exciting start to this meal! But when it came out? A total disappointment. It is seldom, even when a meal is not good, that I think, \"this was shallow/vacuous/trite/vapid\" and yet that is exactly what it tasted like.For dinner, my husband ordered a hearty stew with an interesting citrus, chocolate, and red meat dynamic. He enjoyed it, and rated it a three. I had the spinach tagliatelle that was underwhelming at best. There was very little flavor, but tons of cream. I thought the texture was nice, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. No dessert--we had tried enough.I am not sure if we will be going back here. I promise that there are restaurants in Urbana-Champaign that are WAY better. Perhaps they do not cost as much, or have as gaudy of interiors, but... they taste good.

It was quite nice up there and the service was lovely. I ordered the veal and it was absolutely delicious, and the perfect portion size; however, it was not the perfect portion size for the price.

If you want big portions (and often I do, so I understand the desire), go to Nyro's and get a triple gyro plate. The food is superb, and the waitstaff is excellent. The interior is very cozy and lodge-like (upstairs, anyway). Also, I typically don't like gourmet pizzas (I'm a blue-collar pizza kind of guy) but they really have some excellent pizzas here.On busy college weekends (like parents' weekend or whatever they call it) it's tough to get a reservation here. It's also the place that visiting scholars are often brought to be dined. The food will not disappoint.",

        "review": "The atmosphere: The downstairs bar area is small and cheap looking. The dining room is dated and screams \"cheap 1980's supper club\" - not at all romantic! The restaurant was filled with retirement-age couples/parties about to head to a Krannert performance on the Wednesday evening that we went. This past week, we went to Timpone's to celebrate my birthday. We started off sharing the \"Fritto Misto\" appetizr, described as \"Calamari, Gulf Shrimp, Scallops, Red Onion, and Zucchini.\" When the dish arrived, it was nothing but a pile of glorified onion rings. There were only three pieces of calamari (small tentacles), 3 shrimp (which were small, and clearly of the phosphate-pumped Asian variety, and a scattered few wet calico scallops...95% of the \"Fritto Misto\" was red onion. I feel as though by listing the seafood first, that indicates that the bulk will be seafood, or at the very least, there will be an even distribution of the components. Not wanting to be a \"difficult customer\", I chalked it up to just a \"bad batch.\" That being said, the recipe was a straight copy of Judy Rodgers' dish in the Zuni Cafe (San Francisco) cookbook, and I could have made it at home...However, when I received my entree, \"Sea Scallops with a Dijon Beurre Blanc on a bed of celery root puree\"... I was furious. There were 5 scallops, each approximately the size of a quarter (no exaggeration) and only seared on one side. The mound of puree could not have been more than 1/2 cup (and didn't even taste good). My husband ordered \"Chianti-Braised Shortribs with Homemade Gnocchi\" - which came with fewer than 10 small gnocchi. Worst of all, the food tasted bad; the beurre blanc was so sweet it was like Creme Anglaise with Dijon and I could have done a better braise at home easily. \u00a0I know that times are tough, and that food costs are supposed to be ~30% of the final restaurant price- but I felt completely gouged. I'm happy to pay for a delicious meal and I do not expect large portions. I travel pretty frequently to Chicago and DC- I know what good food costs and what \"normal\" portion sizes are at \"fine dining\" restaurants. I did not want to make a scene because I didn't want my husband to feel bad for picking the restaurant. The only reason this place could possibly stay in business is because of its proximity to campus/the Krannert Center for Performing Arts or because most people have very low expectations due to the lack of \"Fine Dining\" in the C-U area.Our server was very attentive and great, but the food was so bad (even with the small portions, we didn't finish our food and didn't want to take the leftovers home!). We will not be returning.",

Once I opened the front doors, it was like stepping into a whole new world. It was very pretty, neat, and tidy inside. I particularly liked the booths with glass tables. They have decorative cloths covering the windows that gave the place a dim, kind of romantic lighting. It complimented the shades of blues on the booths. Another cute detail was the mini Japanese statues and figurines on the wall opposite of the windows. It helped to show a little bit of culture.There were 3 different menus, one for drinks, sushi, and Teppanyaki (Hibachi) and Teriyaki dishes. Their menus were detailed which helped a lot especially on their drinks menu. I do not find too many menus that define what flavors to expect with their sakes and wines. Although I did eye the Japanese dish menus, I was set on sushi. We ended up waiting over an hour for the sushi. They were short staffed. Only one waiter was going around taking orders and delivering the food. I saw two hostesses when I walked in which was strange to me because why would they need two hostesses when they needed more waiters. Then again it is a small restaurant and the sushi had a bit of a twist.My friend got miso soup, eel roll, and tempura salmon roll. I got a spicy scallop roll, Philadelphia roll, and spicy salmon roll. The miso was a bit salty. The eel roll was tasty. The tempura salmon roll was really cute. It looked like little tofu squares. The spicy scallop roll was so spicy that it covered the taste of the Philly roll. I made a mistake by eating that first. I thought that the pieces of fish in the sushi were a good size. Also I have never seen a spicy salmon roll made the way they made it. It has a piece of salmon in the roll and then spices on the outside. To me, I like heat so this roll was not spicy enough for me. This is where the abundance of spicy sauce on the spicy scallop roll helped out. If I come back, I would try Since the prices are a bit on the expensive side, I might come back here when I'm really craving sushi or Japanese food. I did enjoy the d\u00e9cor and small twists on the rolls though. I think this place is one of the better sushi places in Champaign-Urbana.",

On a particularly busy weekend night, I showed up with a friend and expected to wait for for a table. \u00a0Good news: we were seated immediately. \u00a0Bad news: we were seated at a teppenyaki table...when we had no intention of eating teppenyaki...and we had to share the table with a large family who we obviously did not know. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, I am not offended by cafeteria-style dining (I'm a college student, after all), but this should not be the seating arrangement at a place that presents itself as some kind of fine restaurant. \u00a0Throughout the meal, I had to whisper to my dinner companion to avoid disrupting a stranger's family dinner (awkward?). \u00a0Be careful about bringing a date here, or at least make a reservation in advance.The food? \u00a0Blegh. \u00a0Let me be clear on this--I've tasted sushi on both the east coast and west coast, and I am in no way prejudiced against eating sushi in the Midwest. \u00a0I even think there's some decent sushi in Champaign (at other restaurants), so my standards are not impossible to meet.Again, I've always eaten at Kamakura on busy nights, because I naively assumed that most sushi restaurants will bring out the best fish when serving crowds of customers. \u00a0Instead, I received garbage that smelled and tasted like rotting fish. \u00a0Maybe by the time they got to my order, they had to use the smelly leftovers at the bottom of the barrel? \u00a0When I got home, I tried to purge my mouth with Listerine. \u00a0Even with it's advertised \"deep-cleaning action,\" I couldn't get the taste of putrid fish out of my mouth. \u00a0I drank some coffee, chewed gum, etc., but there was no redemption from the haunting taste of old fish. \u00a0My suggestion? \u00a0Stick to the cooked dishes at Kamakura: tempura, teriyaki, udon, etc.With so many better sushi restaurants in the area, I don't see how Kamakura hangs onto customers. \u00a0I can forgive bad service, but food that ruins your breath for an entire day is not acceptable. \u00a0This is the kind of place that gives sushi a bad reputation.",

I used to go here much more often when I lived in the area, and I was absolutely never disappointed by the quality of the food. Considering it was central Illinois, the prices were good for the sushi we got. The simplest rolls are usually the best--but as for the fancier rolls, we enjoy the Illini roll a lot. The service, however, has been anywhere from outstanding to absolutely horrendous. Once, my friend and I went with a small group, and we saw the waiter exactly once, when he took our order. Later, when we were leaving, we received a totally incorrect check ($20 charge for an $80 meal). However, I've definitely received extremely good service here. I think when they get busy, they focus on the hibachi customers more than the sushi side.I've never had the hibachi, but we're going for a special occasion tomorrow night, so I'll update the review then.I don't understand why Kamakura's getting such a bad rap on Yelp. It's a decent place with affordable sushi. You get twice as much sushi here than at Ko Fusion for the same price--I'm sorry, I'm a little above paying for \"hipness\" in Champaign, thanks.EDIT 7/6/11My family and I had the hibachi dinner on Friday night. Again, not a whole lot of hate here. I enjoyed the speed of service, even for the busy Friday night, and the \"performance\" of the chef, which was understated but amusing. None of us in the party had a bad meal, we were all pretty happy with our food (except for my boyfriend and brother, who were a mite ticked at the portion sizes), and even my mom's girlfriend, who is notoriously picky and had never eaten Japanese food before, was content with her meal.

The waiter kind of half-apologizes and says: \"I won't charge you for the sushi.\" Probably we were way too polite, or didn't show anger or something, because when he brought the check the sushi was there included, with no explanation regarding the change of mind.

The structure of the room, though, feels more like 1950's diner than Japanese restaurant, with a huge pit in the center of the main dining room, and booths to the side. I only caught a quick glimpse of the other side of the restaurant, but it looked a lot cozier than where we were sitting.I came on a fairly quiet Friday night, with maybe only two dozen people in the restaurant, yet the service was definitely below par. After the maitre d' seated us, nobody even came to our table until she wandered back 5 minutes later asking if anyone has showed up to serve us. The waitress was pretty inattentive also; after the appetizer, my glass of water stood empty for the rest of the meal. As for the food, I ordered a beef teriyaki bento box, which came with tempura, rice, miso soup, salad, and three pieces of nigiri sushi. The beef was cooked to perfection, and coated in a teriyaki sauce as delicious as I have ever tasted. Though we are a long way from the closest ocean, the sushi also tasted very fresh. The rest of the bento box was great, as I would expect from an established Japanese restaurant.

When she sent it back to the kitchen, observing that it was not actually agedashi tofu, our server told her that the chef is Japanese, the implication being that it must then be \"authentic.\" Baffling, considering how easy it is now to find a good agedashi tofu recipe online. I will continue to skip the Japanese restaurants in this town, thanks.",

Any other states Mexican food is like a fancy Taco Bell(except this awesome place in Queens). It just doesn't compare. With that being said, I'd say I liked this place. Not loved. Liked. I was seated quickly and was immediately brought chips and salsa. After a few minutes, I met my server and he took my drink order. The menu was large. I wasn't too hungry but needed to eat to avoid a headache later. It was hard to pick since all the items sounded huge. Which is great seeing how good the prices were. I was honestly amazed at their queso. Any time I go to an out of state Mexican place, they either 1. Don't have queso and loom at you like you're crazy when you order it or 2. It's from a can or the same stuff they put on your nachos at ball games. But this stuff was great. I ordered the flauta plate. Like someone else said, it arrived in 5 minutes. Strange since this was a sit down place. I would expect flautas to take at least 15 minutes to arrive. So this makes me think they were made earlier and were kept in a batch under a heat lamp. Even the family of four next time got their food in less than 10 minutes. Hmmm. But regardless, they tasted good. I brought home half of them and the rest of my rice, beans and queso. And for $10 before tip, that's pretty good to have that much leftovers. I'm giving it a 3 just because it was better than I expected and it was quick. But the servers were emotionless and socialized a lot. They were nice but didn't really smile or ask anyone how their food was or check on them. It seemed like they didn't want to be there.",

The atmosphere is what you would expect from a family owned Mexican restaurant. It's my new go-to sit-down Mexican place. The only problems - I do not recommend ordering for pickup. The quality was compromised, but this is nothing new for any restaurant. Also, the other location of El Toro is not even half as impressive as this one. Perhaps the quality gap was due to the fact that I went to the other location with a party of 8, and the restaurant was very crowded, but I would rather order taco bell than go back to the other location.

A few notes:The place is fairly big, but the parking lot isn't, so if you pull up and can't find a spot in the lot, you can find some parking on-street parking and will still be able to get a table once you go in...don't quote me though!For the most part the waitstaff's 1st language is Spanglish, so be prepared to talk slow and point to what you want.....I don't think I ever had an issue with lack of communication. Additionally \u00a0they may be a server short at all times as they are always running around trying to serve and do not fully spend as much time at the table to ensure accuracy of orders (especially special orders, etc.). My last experience the food was just alright....maybe a tad bland and lackluster. I usually get the Alambres dish...but strayed this go round....I'd highly suggest trying the Alambres dish to anyone and will probably stick to that. I usually get the mix of steak, chicken, bacon, peppers, and cheese with the usual sides...comes out like fajitas....sizzling and ensuring it'll be nice and hot.The drinks are alright, but I think are a little too expensive for the alcohol content.I think they would benefit from an aggressive happy hour special with extended hours everyday...something to help them stand apart from all of the other competition in town which may have a slight edge in the flavor/authenticity department..Nonetheless, El toro is a solid place to go.",

The one thing I wanted that they didn't have was a Mole sauce, but most places don't so no big. They had a strong selection of liquor and tequilla, and pretty good drink specials. I enjoyed my enchiladas del mar, and everybody else liked what they got, too. The tamales entree was a hit. They give you warm chips and salsa that is good but pretty mild. I knocked ours up a bit with the Cholula and Tapatio they put on the tables and was sweating gleefully in no time.I wanted to try their Margarona, which is a margarita with a corona stuck into it. I know, it sounds gross to mix beer with liquor, but if it is done right, it can be surprisingly delightful.

The menu is typical mexican fare; the only thing that annoyed me here was lack of pricing on the drink menu. \u00a0The margaritas are fresh blended, which can be a little annoying sitting close to the bar, and margaritas prepared this way tend to be a lot more liquid than frozen. \u00a0The medium size was on sale for a still expensive ~7 dollars. \u00a0The strength was about average, nothing too impressive. \u00a0So my biggest complaint is the waitress. We were seated right by 2 other tables that she also had, so she walked by us every couple of minutes, but seemed completely oblivious to us. \u00a0We had all ordered water at the start, and we were all out of water well before the time our margaritas came. She didn't notice. \u00a0Not even when she brought our margaritas did she care to ask if we wanted refills. \u00a0Finally, when she did another pass, I asked for a water refill; she only grabbed my glass and refilled it (even though everybody else at the table was also empty). \u00a0So, when she came back, another person at our table asked for a refill. Not getting the hint, she then just grabbed his glass and didn't think to ask anybody else if they wanted refills, luckily the other person at the table spoke up asking for a refill (as a waitress you really should be checking these things). \u00a0Same thing happened with Chips and Salsa; we were empty for the longest time, and only once we asked did we receive some more... unfortunately it must've been the bottom of the bag/basket since they were pretty much all crushed. \u00a0On the plus side, their salsa is definitely the best we've had in the C-U area... the chips weren't quite as good. \u00a0And if this wasn't enough, we also had an issue with our food order. \u00a0One of the guys at our table ordered 3 enchiladas a la carte. \u00a0When our order arrived, he only had 1 enchilada. \u00a0We asked the waitress about it, and she claimed that she thought he had only ordered 1 enchilada. \u00a0But, when she brings us the check, she clearly wrote (and tried to charge us) for the 3 enchiladas. \u00a0Surely, you would check something like this before delivering the bill (or when sending the food order to the kitchen). \u00a0Also, despite the fact that we were clearly 3 unrelated people, there was no offer to split the check. \u00a0I guess I'm giving it 2 stars simply because the food was decent, and this one waitress is hopefully not a reflection of the rest of the wait staff.",

The highlight of Huaraches Moreleon (and what keeps us coming back more than anything else) is definitely their homemade chips and the three sauces they bring out with them. Molto bene! I mean, muy bueno! Whatever. They're pretty good.The best entree they make is the Aver Si Puede (\"See if You Can\"), which is basically a gigantic plate of meat with some rice and beans thrown in the middle in case you were in need of inferior sources of protein to feel like you're eating Mexican food. It feeds two large people or a small family of small people. Their basic enchilada sauce is not much more than watered-down tomato sauce. The mole sauce is ok. The chipotle sauce on the Enchiladas Suizas is probably the best I've had thus far. Still, even the worst enchiladas are pretty decent.I like the breakfast skillets. Don't order soup.I have not had good experiences with their more \"exotic\" offerings such as tripas or lengua tacos. Either the chef does not know how to make them, or the ingredients are poor. Superior tripas tacos can be found on literally any taco truck operating in the area between Santa Monica and Houston, TX. Go to Huaraches, but avoid these menu items.Oh, the prices are reasonable, and the service is typically fast unless you order the more \"exotic\" offerings I mentioned.The food is great for the area, but it still doesn't hold a candle to most Mexican food in the Southwest. For that I have to give it four out of five stars. But you should still go. This is a small, fledgling place, and it deserves your custom.",

I've been eyeing it for a while, and finally happened to be by today at lunch and stopped in. I am so glad I did, and I'll be finding a reason to head over that direction again soon.The carnitas huarache was fantastic. Really flavorful carnitas: \u00a0juicy and tender with a great char outside. The huarache itself was tasty, and the cheese was great too - not that plastic stuff you get most places. It came with a little bag of perfectly fried, thin and crispy chips and 3 salsas that ranged from fruity to spicy. I wasn't a huge fan of any of the salsas in all honesty, but the huarache more than made up for it.There are 3 tables that seat 4 and a couple of tables for 2, plus some counter seating. I don't think that building has ever been so sparkling and clean, even way back when it was Sweet Betsy's years ago. They obviously did a lot of work in there.

Oh my, they bring out 3 bottles of house-made sauces to the table with the chips, and those sauces.....the green is my favorite and the smoky red comes in a close second!!!-The guacamole is fresh and just as yummy as guac can be-Also it's always an awesome value-Did I mention they have a full breakfast menu too??!-I could go on and on but I will stop now.

I know that there are numerous thai restaurants in Chicago, but I had been limited to the suburbs and DeKalb, until finding Thara in Champaign. I love Thai food, i.e. grownup chinese food. It tastes better and fresher in my opinion. At Thara Thai, you will not be disappointed by anything.I arrived here with my brother after he had been raving about this place. The best Thai I had ever had was Thai Pavillion, located in DeKalb, Illinois. Sorry TP, you have been bumped!We got here around 7:50 on a Saturday night. The restaurant is located right off of 74, and could be easily missed. It's surrounded by McDonalds and gas stations. The exterior is not great, but the interior is calm and inviting. After being seated, it took a while to get our drinks, but after that, the service was smooth sailing. My brother ordered the Seafood pad thai. I decided on the See Eiw pad thai, which was a special. Basically, it is your standard pad thai, but instead of thin rice noodles, it came with wide rice noodles, which I prefer. We also decided to split the basil stir fried vegetable dish.Our food was promptly delivered in 12 minutes, which was a surprise because my brother had said on his previous visits that the service was a bit slow, but the food was very good. In my case, both were amazing!The basil vegetables were excellent. I was debating on whether to get Kee Mao as my main course, but by splitting this dish, all my taste buds were satisfied (Kee Mao is cooked in a basil garlic sauce, just like the vegetable dish we split). As for my Chicken See Eiw pad thai... simple amazing. The noodles were stirfried along with the veggies, and all were very fresh. I ordered my dish mild, because I'm just not a spicy guy. I would have preferred more chicken, but I would have received less noodles, so I was fine with it. My bro gave me a piece of his shrimp, and it was awesome as well (this coming from a guy who hates seafood, and I'm just trying to get over my fear of eating it).I will say that I was disappointed that my dish was not garnished with lime, carrots, or cabbage, which is usually a staple of the pad thai dish. But that's definitely not enough to take off a star.Our total was 44 and change. My bro went with a very expensive dish (10.99 + 5 for seafood). I had the 12.99 special, and we split a 9.99 entree. Not bad, but a little pricey for a budget. The lunch special looks like a good deal, and apparently it is the same size as dinner, so I would do that to be more friendly to my wallet!My new favorite thai place. Too bad it's 2 hours away! that won't stop me... As Arnold said... I'LL BE BACK.",

As a teacher...school is out for summer (as my principal sang on the announcements yesterday) so my culinary horizons will be expanding in Central IL. I love Papa Del's and Original Pancake House. LITTLE DID I KNOW THIS GEM WOULD BE AMONG my cannot miss list while in the area!We arrived and the restaurant was half filled. We got to pick where to sit (rather than have to wait like those who arrived as we were leaving). My mother and I noticed that we were in the minority (IE Caucasian). She was correct in her assumption that that is how \"you know it's good\". The restaurant was filled with 20 somethings eating their pho, pad thai, and other Asian dishes.I noticed that their prices are a little high, but their portions are GIGANTIC!!!!! Case in point: they have a list of appetizers like satay, shumai, and dumplings that are priced like other places. But their salads (we ordered a shrimp salad) and soups come in such large bowls that they are similarly priced to entree and noodle dishes. The bowls are gigantic. For you Seinfeld fans out there, soup is not a meal, so I knew we had some noodles in our future. I will say that this restaurant is located next to a questionable motel. Well, it is worth the \"walk of shame\", drug ring, or murder that is going on here while you dine. The restaurant is so small and unassuming. Well guess what!? Quality and flavor are not small here!I decided since I hate ordering the same thing as people I dine with (mom got the Pad Thai Chicken mild), I would go with the 13.99 priced Egg Noodle Pad Thai. It was very close to Chinese lo mein. It was delicious. If I could go back I would order what my mother had for $3 less. I ordered off the Thara Special Noodle menu while mommy kept it simple with her order. It was defintely spicier They also give you the option of mild, medium, or spicy which I thought was great. I stay away from fried food when dining out but this was fantastic!My only gripe with this place is the prices! With our salad, we asked for dressing on the side but I was an idiot and didn't even read the menu! The waitress came by and was nice enough to explain that the dressing was always made with the salad and there was nothing on the side. Oops on my part!So what if they charge a ton of money for gigantic portions? I couldn't believe how many Asians were in this place when we arrived. They must love how it is \"close to what mom makes\", which is what I asked a girl dining on her PHO!They must have to charge a little more for their specialty dishes to keep the drug dealers, hookers, and pimps out from next store. The second time I went back I went for the standard Chicken Pad Thai or Pad Thai Chicken (you can say it both ways...I specifically asked...hooray learning while dining). This is the best place I've found in Champaign for lunch or dinner. I love Papa Del's, but I'd take Thara Thai eight days a week!",

I've been able to taste many items on the menu, and I have to say, my favorite is the Thai Green Curry! If you're a curry fan, you will love it. But, even if you're not, you will still probably love it... or at least something on the menu. Ask the waiter what they suggest - they will be able to give you a really good reference based on your other preferences! Now, that is service.Although I prefer take-out here, eating in is a good option. The d\u00e9cor is comfortable, and you can show up in any state (I typically go after the gym, he he). Taking a moment to talk about price, price is the one downfall of this joint. The food is rather expensive, and the portions are small. If I (little ole' me) can eat a whole Curry without feeling overly stuffed, the portions are small. Granted, I'm not a huge rice eater, but I know my Curry and I know small Curry. So, be prepared to take a little bit of a pocket pinch. Is the food worth the price?

The service was also a bit slow. I was here for lunch with a small group, with the restaurant nearly empty, and it still took around 30 minutes for our meals to come. I'm happy that all the food is made to order, but it seemed like a long time given there was such a slow stream of customers. I ordered one of my favorites, the green papaya salad, and it was totally fine, but not extraordinary enough to warrant the weirdly high price ($10 as compared to $7 or so at most other Thai places). The fairly generous portion made the $12 blow to my wallet a bit more palatable. I had the pad thai lunch special on my other visit, and though it was cheaper than the dinner price for pad thai, it was still around $8, which is closer to the dinner price you'd pay for the dish at most Thai places in town.They are good about adjusting spiciness to your preference.

They give you a choice of no spice, mild, medium, and spicy. But you can say extra mild so your mouth isn't in pain later. Be prepared to wait a while for your food, maybe 35-45 minutes. The first time we went, we were a little mad the table of 10 that ordered 15 minutes after us got all their dishes and were nearly finished by the time just me and my husband were served. We like that it is a family business and that they have a lot of vegetarian options for when we're not feeling like having meat. Tofu is cooked perfectly every time. The atmosphere isn't fancy, but the food is excellent.",

The staff is always incredibly friendly. The owner and all her family are really friendly and always make you feel welcome. You might want to show up a little early for lunch as it can get very busy at that time.One thing you'll notice right away as you're eating are the quality ingredients which to me justifies the price of the dishes here. My favorite dish there is the Thom Kha Gai. At this point it is like comfort food for me. Whenever I'm having a down day or if I feel like I'm coming down with a cold I'll go in and order it. It has a lot of different levels of flavor that you just don't get anywhere else in town. There's just a lot more ingredients in the dish then most places and they blend perfectly. I never, ever leave anything other than an empty bowl. \u00a0I usually get it about mild to medium spicy. The thing to remember when ordering here is that their spiciness levels can vary and almost always swing towards HOTTER than you might expect. So always get mild if you have any fear of getting too hot of a dish.I have yet to be disappointed by their curry, but my favorite is probably the Massaman curry. I'd also recommend their spring rolls and their pot stickers for an appetizer. Although I've never tried it, one of my friend's can't stop getting their Duck so that might be worth a try as well. I might steer clear of the Pad Thai here. Strangely it's the only thing I've never been 100% happy with, but frankly you can get a decent Pad Thai just about anywhere so it's more fun to branch out and try something new.",

Every time my husband took me out for Thai, it was to My Thai or Nitaya Thai. Every time I would say, \"Hey, I've never been to Thara Thai, let's try it because I don't actually like My Thai that much\" he would be like \"Let's not because every time I go there with 40 other people for lunch it takes a long time. Let's just go to My Thai.\"So I finally went to Thara Thai with a group of friends. I can't believe I've been missing out on Thara Thai for so long! GRR HUSBAND*.The pros: FOOD. The food is AMAZING. I'm a fiend for eggplant dishes, but haven't found one that has knocked me out of the park at any of the other local Thai restaurants. The eggplant basil stir fry dish is phenomenal. I ordered a mild spice level, even though I like spice, just because I was afraid of going too hot. Next time, I'll definitely get medium, since I ended up dousing my dish with sriracha. The dish clearly took time and effort to make, and the result was phenomenal. The prices are on the higher side, but not unreasonable for a date night or special outing. I had a Thai iced tea, and it was very, very good. The service was great - very prompt, water glasses were filled, super friendly.The cons: The wait time can be long. Again, I recommend it for a date, or for a dinner where you might have some extra time to spare. I don't think it would be good for a business or mid-day lunch break, as you might not get done within an hour if you go with a group. Again, price is a little steep, but considering that the food is housemade and not just scooped from a vat of prepared food, these things are worth it. *Disclaimer - not really mad.

Not to insult the C-U area or anything but the restaurants are overall lacking in quality in this neck of the woods. Thara Thai has all the typical Thai dishes you would expect. This place is pretty traditional so don't expect the yuppy-ized all white chicken meat in the \u00a0dishes, either. The curries, pad thai, and pad see ew are all pretty average. There's nothing amazing about this place but it is probably the best Thai food available in the area.I do have to say, don't bother with the veggie spring rolls or veggie potstickers, I'm pretty sure those are frozen. \u00a0DO however check out the sticky rice with custard dessert. Pretty yummy.",

This is a family restaurant - meaning the entire family is part of the business, and they are all great folks. FRESH - HOMEMADE - DELICIOUS - FRIENDLYEverything on the menu is good. They cook to order, so if you like it a certain way all you have to do is say so... and if you don't see it on the menu, you can bet that they can still make it as good as you have had it anywhere else. It is probably worth mentioning that they have expanded their menu a few times and because I love just ab out everything they make it gets harder and harder to decide what to order when I want to try the new stuff too...To Joe E, I have to tell you that Pad Thai(PT) is not the same dish as Pad See Ewe (PSE) at all - the only similarity being that they have rice noodles in them (yet still the type of rice noodle is even different). If you are a PT fan, the next time you go there you should ask them to make you PT with the wide noodles. Their \u00a0PT is the best around, but it doesn't taste anything like the PSE as the former has peanut as a dominant flavor, while the latter is sweet soy flavor. Thara's PSE thai hot is actually one of my favorite standby dishes, with fresh wide rice noodles and chinese broccoli - YUM! I have yet to be able to make it better at home, although I have come close. \u00a0 A couple of my favorites here (and there are so many) are the shrimp/seafood soups (Tom Yum or Tom Kha) and the Panang Curry - all of which has the wonderful aroma and flavor of the Kaffir lime in them. \u00a0We almost always order the crab Rangoon - which is not even in the same realm as the typical Chinese place stuff - this is fresh and delicious. My buddy loves their shumai, although that might be kind of an acquired taste as my wife is not fond of it.. \u00a0 A few folks commented on their high prices, but there simply is no substitute for good Thai food. The location is what it is, but they have never sacrificed the quality to stay in business. The fact is that even after they raised their prices you are lucky to get a table here in the evening or on weekends - they are almost always packed. \u00a0This is a prime example of supply and demand economics at work. This is a real gem of a restaurant, and I love to support this great family. As long as they stay in business and keep making the food the way they do, they can expect to see us as often as we can make it there!",
